We have employed a coalescent-based Bayesian analysis of chloroplast microsatellite data to infer demographic and evolutionary parameters of this species. Two different demographic models applied to data from seven chloroplast microsatellite loci among 59 accessions show that the effective population size of C. bursa-pastoris is very small indicating a rapid expansion of the species, a result that is in accordance with fossil and historical data. Against this background, analysis of flowering time variation among accessions suggests that ecotypic differentiation in flowering time has occurred recently in the species' history. Finally, our results also indicate that mononucleotide repeat loci in the chloroplast genome can deteriorate in relatively short periods of evolutionary time."

It arrived in California not before 200 years ago. Thirteen populations from California, seven from Spain and one from Germany were analyzed with RAPDs in order to trace the introduction history and to study the structure of the colonial populations. The results not only supported earlier hypotheses on the colonization of Capsella which were based in isozyme studies (Hurka, 1993; Hurka ef al, 1989) and phenotypic traits (Hurka and Neuffer, 1991), but helped also to understand the colonization history in more detail. Overall similarity in RAPD markers was greater between Californian Central Valley and Spanish populations than it was between Central Valley and Californian mountain populations. It is concluded that genotypes preadapted to Mediterranean climate conditions were brought to California by Spaniards from Mexico. Their ancestral populations might be found in Spain which is strongly argued far by RAPD markers. They now occupy the Central Valley of California. The Californian mountains are colonized by other genotypes, the source of which is not yet clear, but unlikely to be of Mediterranean climate origin. In general, colonial Californian populations are genetically less variable than the European populations, but more variable than one would conclude by isozyme studies. Population structures of the colonial populations as revealed by RAPD studies are in full accordance with the expected organization of genetic variability within and between populations of a predominantly self colonizing plant."

North America was depauperate in the number of genotypes (by approximate to 50%), but in terms of frequencies, a few genotypes were common and shared by both continents. Although some, very rare, genotypes were, however, unique for North America, our data provided no evidence to indicate that the introduced gene pools were reconstructed on a multilocus genetic basis after introduction. Instead, they argued for a considerable number of independent introduction events. Geographical distribution patterns of multilocus genotypes in Europe and North America were pronounced and enabled us to trace the colonization history of Californian Capsella back to Spanish ancestral populations and those of temperate North America back to temperate European gene pools. A random-block field experiment with 14 Californian populations from different climatic regions revealed that variation patterns of quantitative traits reflect ecotypic variation, and the ecological amplitude of Capsella in North America is similar to that in Europe, which can be traced back to the introduction of preadapted genotypes. It appears that certain multilocus isozyme genotypes are associated with certain ecotypes. The variable European gene pool of Capsella was essentially introduced into North America without major genetic changes."

Together with two accessions of mustard (Brassica juncea) as outgroups, seven populations of C. bursa- postoris were used to study genetic polymorphism using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Using 12 primers, a total of 158 RAPD markers were selected among these populations. Among them, 91 are either specific for C. bursa- postris or present in both C. bursa-postoris and B. juncea. In Capsella populations, 40 RAPD markers are polymorphic, 5 markers are population specific, and 46 markers are monomorphic with variation of banding density. Each RAPD marker was treated as either having unweighted character ol weighted character. Using UPGMA for cluster analysis, the polymorphic tree structures based on unweighted and weighted character have a similar phylogenetic relationship among these tested populations. With one exception, the phylogenetic relationship of Taiwan origin is correlated with the geographical distribution of these populations. These results may provide us information of genetic variation to be used in a varietal development program and to find specific markers linked to important traits."

Capsella is native to Europe and was introduced into South America in the 16th century. In Patagonia, we detected 23 different multilocus associations, but only five occurred in a frequency of more than 5%. By comparison with the geographic distribution patterns of multilocus genotypes in Europe, we inferred the ancestral European gene pools and the possible introduction routes. A particular multilocus genotype (MMG) was most frequent in the investigated area, and is native to the Iberian Peninsula. This genotype was with all probability introduced by Spaniards into central and northern South America, and it could have reached Patagonia from the north step by step. Other genotypes probably used a direct route from Europe, most likely via British sheep farmers in the second half of the 19th century. Rare genotypes in Patagonia may have been introduced recently by chance, or might be due to multilocus rearrangements in connection with rare outcrossing events. RAPD markers helped to trace colonial gene pools outside Europe and ancestral European gene pools and support the isozyme studies. Correlations between the life history traits and allozyme markers give evidence of the role adaptation may play in the colonizing process."

 flower morphology occurs in several genera within the family and is
 considered to affect speciation processes. We analysed genetic
 differentiation and flowering time variation of two floral variants of
 Capsella bursa-pastoris, the Spe variant and the wild-type, which occur
 sympatrically in a vineyard in southwest Germany. The Spe variant is
 characterized by an additional whorl of stamens instead of petals and
 was formerly classified as an independent taxon 'Capsella apetala'
 Opiz. Amplified fragment length polymorphism and allozyme analysis
 revealed a substantial genetic differentiation of the two floral
 variants and a higher genetic variation within the wild-type
 subpopulation compared with the Spe subpopulation. The low genetic
 variation in the mutant provided evidence of a recent local origin or
 recent introduction. Flowering time analysis indicated that, within the
 analysed population, the Spe variant flowers significantly later than
 the wild-type (P < 0.001). We conclude that the evolution and
 persistence of Spe within a wild-type population is facilitated by high
 selfing rates and been enhanced by a shift in flowering phenology.
 Hence, our data provide substantial evidence that the Spe phenotype has
 established itself as an isolated entity within a wild-type population
 and may thus serve as a model for the analysis of the evolutionary
 significance of homeotic mutants in wild populations."

In the last 20 years our basic understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant tolerance and adaptation to saline environments has greatly improved owing to active development of advanced tools in molecular, genomics, and bioinformatics analyses. However, the full potential of investigative power has not been fully exploited, because the use of halophytes as model systems in plant salt tolerance research is largely neglected. The recent introduction of halophytic Arabidopsis-Relative Model Species (ARMS) has begun to compare and relate several unique genetic resources to the well-developed Arabidopsis model. In a search for candidates to begin to understand, through genetic analyses, the biological bases of salt tolerance, 11 wild relatives of Arabidopsis thaliana were compared: Barbarea verna, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Hirschfeldia incana, Lepidium densiflorum, Malcolmia triloba, Lepidium virginicum, Descurainia pinnata, Sisymbrium officinale, Thellungiella parvula, Thellungiella salsuginea (previously T. halophila), and Thlaspi arvense. Among these species, highly salt-tolerant (L. densiflorum and L. virginicum) and moderately salt-tolerant (M. triloba and H. incana) species were identified. Only T. parvula revealed a true halophytic habitus, comparable to the better studied Thellungiella salsuginea. Major differences in growth, water transport properties, and ion accumulation are observed and discussed to describe the distinctive traits and physiological responses that can now be studied genetically in salt stress research."

Samples from different European localities were genotyped. Up to six alleles per locus were observed in C. rubella, and up to 22 alleles per locus in C. bursa-pastoris. Observed heterozygosities were low, indicating high selfing rates, especially in C. rubella.

The colonising success may be associated with fine-scaled ecotypic differentiation, and regional adaptation. Seeds of 377 individuals from 40 provenances were collected over a distance of more than 2500 km from the Kola Peninsula in the north to the Caspian Sea in the south in Russia and from northern to southern Scandinavia. 3558 progenies were investigated in common garden field experiments in order to distinguish between phenotypic variability and genetic variation of quantitative life-history traits (onset of flowering, rosette diameter, leaf type, plant height, and branching and fruit characters). Genetic diversity and population structure was examined with isozyme analysis. Along both transects, Capsella showed clinal differentiation in phenotypic traits: e.g., the most northern and most southern provenances flowered earlier than the provenances from in between. A highly significant quadratic correlation exists between morphological traits and the degree of latitude. Distribution of leaf types showed no geographical pattern, unlike that observed for other regions. Allozyme variation follows a pattern of isolation by distance."

These benefits may have been compromised over recent decades by declining weed diversity. The decline in wild arable plant diversity has been viewed predominantly in terms of species shifts a view that ignores the genetic and functional variation existing within species and the impact on ecological and evolutionary processes which this may have. To examine within-species diversity, ISSR markers were used in parallel with environmental and phenotypic characterisation, to investigate the population structure and diversity of Capsella bursa-pastoris (shepherd's purse) from arable fields in the UK. Analysis of 338 ISSR products for 109 individuals from 51 accessions obtained from the seed banks of 33 arable fields showed that in-field populations of shepherd's purse were genetically differentiated between individuals, and among accessions and fields. In addition, cluster analysis identified three genetically distinct regional-scale populations. Phenotypic variation was present at all scales of genetic differentiation, including the regional scale where populations differed in their key life-history traits: flowering time, fecundity and dormancy. Genetic drift is proposed as a contributor to differentiation among genetically isolated but locally co-occurring accessions. In addition, the genetic and phenotypic variation in shepherd's purse exhibited large scale, spatial trends and showed statistically significant associations with cropping intensity and soil-pH. These results suggest that adaptation as a result of selection by cropping practise and soil-pH has played a role in the ability of shepherd's purse to colonise and persist in arable fields."

Animals have the option to escape from stressful environments, but plants do not. In plants, polyploids consist of about 30%-70% angiosperms and 95% ferns, of which some are important crops such as cotton and wheat. How polyploid plants adapt to various habitats has been a fundamental question remained largely unanswered. The tetraploid Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) is one of the most successful plants on earth and has been distributed across the world, thus being an ideal model system for studying the adaptation of polyploids. We found that there are frequent introgressions from congeneric diploids to Shepherd's purse. Ecological niche modeling suggests that ecological differentiation is evident between the introgressed and non-introgressed C. bursa-pastoris, and the introgressions are a source of adaptation. This result links an evolutionary process to the adaptation of polyploids, and sheds light on the breeding strategy of polyploids as well. We conclude that frequent introgressions from congeneric diploids contributed to the acquisition of adequate genetic variations, thereby allowing C. bursa-pastoris to adapt to various habitats across the world. Our results highlight how a polyploid could have successfully established after it originated."

However, detailed genomic analyses of the interpopulation diversification of polyploids following genome duplication are still in their infancy, mainly because of methodological limits, both in terms of sequencing and computational analyses. The shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) is one of the most common weed species in the world. It is highly self-fertilizing, and recent genomic data indicate that it is an allopolyploid, resulting from hybridization between the ancestors of the diploid species Capsella grandiflora and Capsella orientalis. Here, we investigated the genomic diversity of C.bursa-pastoris, its population structure and demographic history, following allopolyploidization in Eurasia. To that end, we genotyped 261 C.bursa-pastoris accessions spread across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, using genotyping-by-sequencing, leading to a total of 4274 SNPs after quality control. Bayesian clustering analyses revealed three distinct genetic clusters in Eurasia: one cluster grouping samples from Western Europe and Southeastern Siberia, the second one centred on Eastern Asia and the third one in the Middle East. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) supported the hypothesis that C.bursa-pastoris underwent a typical colonization history involving low gene flow among colonizing populations, likely starting from the Middle East towards Europe and followed by successive human-mediated expansions into Eastern Asia. Altogether, these findings bring new insights into the recent multistage colonization history of the allotetraploid C.bursa-pastoris and highlight ABC and genotyping-by-sequencing data as promising but still challenging tools to infer demographic histories of selfing allopolyploids."
