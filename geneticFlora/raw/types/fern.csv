Polymorphic markers were then used to study the genetic diversity and structure of populations within the UK and Ireland where this species grows at the northern edge of its range, requiring a specific rock habitat and limited to a few scattered populations. Three dinucleotide loci detected a high level of diversity (23 alleles and 28 multilocus genotypes) across the UK and Ireland, with nearly all variation partitioned among rather than within populations. Of 17 populations represented by multiple samples, all except four were monomorphic. Heterozygosity was detected in three populations, all within Glamorgan, Wales (UK), showing evidence of outcrossing. We make inferences on the factors determining the observed levels and patterns of genetic variation and the possible evolutionary history of the populations."

Four protein-coding genes, all four rRNA genes and six tRNA genes occur in the IR. Most (57) putative protein-coding genes appear to start with an ATG codon, but we also detected five other possible start codons, some of which suggest tRNA editing. We also found 26 apparent stop codons in 18 putative genes, also suggestive of RNA editing. We found all but one of the tRNA genes necessary to encode the complete repertoire required for translation. The missing trnK gene appears to have been disrupted by a large inversion, relative to other published chloroplast genomes. We detected several structural rearrangements that may provide useful information for phylogenetic studies."

 be absent in a large and ancient clade that includes nearly 90% of fern

 is still present and located on the boundary of a large-scale
 inversion. We surveyed the chloroplast genome sequence of clade-member
 Adiantum capillus-veneris for evidence of a still present but
 fragmented trnK intron. Lack of signature structural domains and
 sequence motifs in the genome indicate loss of the trnK intron through
 degradation in an ancestor of the clade. In plants, matK preferentially
 catalyzes splicing of the trnK intron, but may also have a generalist
 function, splicing other group II introns in the chloroplast genome. We
 therefore tested whether a shift in selective constraint has occurred
 after loss of the trnK intron. Using previously unavailable sequences
 for several ferns, we compared matK sequences of the intron-less fern
 clade to sequences from seed plants and ferns with the intron and found
 no significant differences in selection among lineages using multiple
 methods. We conclude that matK in ferns has maintained its apparently
 ancient and generalized function in chloroplasts, even after the loss
 of its co-evolved group II intron. Finally, we also present primers
 that will allow amplification and nucleotide sequencing of the
 phylogenetically useful matK gene in additional fern taxa."

Phylogenetic relationships within the genus as well as its relationships with other putatively taenitidoid genera and with traditionally cheilanthoid Cosentinia vellea have been poorly resolved and are investigated here. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses of rbcL sequences were used to test 1) the monophyly of Anogramma, 2) support for the proposed specific distinctness of A. guatemalensis and A. caespitosa from A. leptophylla, and 3) the asserted close (sister) relationship between Anogramma and Pityrogramma, as well as to infer the phylogenetic relationships among these genera. Results reveal that Anogramma in the traditional sense is polyphyletic. Anogramma guatemalensis and A. caespitosa nest within A. leptophylla. Pityrogramma is not sister to Anogramma as a whole but only to A. chaerophylla and A. novogaliciana. Anogramma osteniana is deeply separated from its traditional congeners and the new combination Jamesonia osteniana (Dutra) Gastony is made. Cosentinia vellea should not be subsumed within Cheilanthes but instead should be considered a taenitidoid genus closely related to A. leptophylla and A. lorentzii. Neighbor joining analysis of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism data sets inferred relationships among the A. leptophylla accessions, embedding A. guatemalensis and A. caespitosa in respective New World and Old World clades of A. leptophylla."

Tetraploid populations were encountered throughout Europe and further afield, whereas diploid populations were scarcer and predominated in the Pannonian-Balkan region. Hexaploids were encountered only in southern Mediterranean populations. Four haplotypes were found among diploid populations of the Pannonian-Balkans indicating that this region formed a northern Pleistocene refugium. A separate polyploid complex centred on Greece, comprises diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid populations with two endemic haplotypes and suggests long-term persistence of populations in the southern Mediterranean. Three chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) haplotypes were common among tetraploids in Spain and Italy, with diversity reducing northwards suggesting expansion from the south after the Pleistocene.

The Ceterach clade is characterised by irregular anastomosing veins and often densely scaled leaf blades. Its taxonomic status as a group nested within Asplenium is confirmed, and it is accepted here as a subgenus with seven species. The Ceterach clade comprises four lineages that correspond to disjunct polyploid complexes: the A. aureum clade forming a polyploid complex (4x, 6x, 8x) in Macaronesia, the A. ceterach clade forming a polyploid complex (2x, 4x, 6x) in the Mediterranean Basin, the A. paucivenosum clade (4x, 6x) in central Asia, and the A. dalhousiae clade (2x) with a disjunct distribution in the Himalaya, Yemen and Eritrea, and southwestern North America. Asplenium paucivenosum is sister to all other members of the Ceterach clade, whereas A. dalhousiae is sister to the A. aureum clade that includes tetraploid A. aureum, hexaploid A. lolegnamense, and octoploid A. parvifolium. Asplenium ceterach and its variations - including the hexaploid A. ceterach subsp. mediterraneum subsp. nov. first described below - form a monophyletic unit, sister to a clade consisting of A. aureum and A. dalhousiae. Asplenium cordatum from Africa and A. haugthonii from the isolated atlantic island of St. Helena are not members of the Ceterach clade, which suggests that leaf blades with dense indumenta have evolved at least twice within asplenioid ferns. The allotetraploid species A. hybridum has the chloroplast DNA from A. ceterach, and therefore the latter species is the maternal ancestor of the former The other parent of this hybrid species is A. sagittatum that is nested within the sister clade of Ceterach, the Phyllitis clade comprising A. sagittatum and A. scolopendrium. The findings suggest that the current distribution of Ceterach is either the result of long-distance dispersal or represents fragmented relicts of a previously more widely distributed species."

A. ceterach occurs on the Canary Islands, in addition to A. aureum and an octoploid taxon.

Our allozyme data suggest that the Canarian A. ceterach population is not completely genetically isolated from the European ones. The holotype of Ceterach aureum var. parvifolium, formerly regarded as an octoploid taxon, proved to be A. ceterach, leaving the octoploid without a correct name. The recently described A. octoploideum shows monomorphic, presumably fixed heterozygosity for a combination of the patterns seen in A. ceterach and A. aureum at four loci (Aat, Skdh, Me, and Pgi-2) confirming its allo-octoploid nature. It most probably originated by chromosome doubling in a tetraploid hybrid between A. aureum and A. ceterach or via the union of their unreduced gametes.

To test this hypothesis, electrophoretic analyses of eight enzyme systems encoded by fourteen putative loci and cytological studies of the artificial hybrid between both diploid varieties were conducted. Alleles of the loci Lap- 1, Mdh-2, Mdh-3, Pgm-1, Pgm-1', and 6Pgd-1 emerged as genetic markets for the diploids and were present in an additive pattern in most of the analyzed individuals of the tetraploid. Cytological results indicated a high degree of genomic homology between the diploids. These results indicated that the tetraploid behaves as a segmental allopolyploid. Our results showed that both diploids were involved in the origin of the tetraploid. We propose the new combination Asplenium obovatum subsp. protobillotii for one of the diploids."

Evidence from pteridophytes.","Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","66: 23-37.","Summary Paper","","","","In this paper we demonstrate that, by investigating polyploid complexes in Asplenium, it is possible to locate the areas in Europe that are southern glacial refugia, and are likely to have been so since the beginning of the Pleistocene during the consecutive cold and warm periods in Europe. Identification and conservation of these specific areas that serve as safe havens for plants, and perhaps animals, is of paramount importance for the maintenance of European biodiversity because Man’s activities are resulting in an ever-increasing loss of natural habitats and putting diversity at risk. The genus Asplenium in Europe comprises some 50 taxa: half of these are diploid while the other half are polyploids derived from the diploids. All aspleniums in Europe are (small) rock ferns with high substrate specificity. Today, most of mainland Europe, Scandinavia and the British Isles has been colonized by polyploid Asplenium species, while the diploids that gave rise to these polyploids are distributed around (and more or less confined to) the Mediterranean Basin. In the tetraploids genetic variation is partitioned mostly between sites, whereas diploids show a high degree of genetic variation both within and between sites. The tetraploid taxa seem capable of single spore colonization via intragametophytic selfing, but the diploid taxa appear to be predominantly outbreeding. For most diploids at least two gametophytes, produced by different spores, have to be present to achieve fertilization and subsequent sporophyte formation for the successful colonization of a new site. This results in a slower rate of colonization. The formation of auto- and allopolyploid taxa from diploid communities appears to have been a recurrent and common feature in Europe. Minority cytotype exclusion is likely to prevent the establishment of tetraploids within the diploid communities, but spores from tetraploids can establish populations outside the diploid communities. The differences between colonization abilities of tetraploid and ancestral diploid taxa, resulting from their different breeding systems, has prevented the merging and mingling of their ranges and led to the establishment of contact/ hybrid zones. This has resulted in the restriction of diploid populations to ancient glacial refugia and the colonization of the rest of Europe by polyploids. Mapping the current distribution of these diploid communities and comparing the genetic diversity within and between outbreeding diploid Asplenium taxa allows us to define the area, age and historical biogeography of these refugia and to assess their importance for present day genetic and species diversity in Europe."

Whether isolated populations indeed show this genetic signature of isolation depends on the amount and diversity of diaspores arriving by long-distance dispersal, and time since colonization. For ferns, however, reliable estimates of long-distance dispersal rates remain largely unknown, and previous studies on fern population genetics often sampled older or non-isolated populations. Young populations in recent, disjunct habitats form a useful study system to improve our understanding of the genetic impact of long-distance dispersal. Microsatellite markers were used to analyse the amount and distribution of genetic diversity in young populations of four widespread calcicole ferns (Asplenium scolopendrium, diploid; Asplenium trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens, tetraploid; Polystichum setiferum, diploid; and Polystichum aculeatum, tetraploid), which are rare in The Netherlands but established multiple populations in a forest (the Kuinderbos) on recently reclaimed Dutch polder land following long-distance dispersal. Reference samples from populations throughout Europe were used to assess how much of the existing variation was already present in the Kuinderbos. A large part of the Dutch and European genetic diversity in all four species was already found in the Kuinderbos. This diversity was strongly partitioned among populations. Most populations showed low genetic variation and high inbreeding coefficients, and were assigned to single, unique gene pools in cluster analyses. Evidence for interpopulational gene flow was low, except for the most abundant species. The results show that all four species, diploids as well as polyploids, were capable of frequent long-distance colonization via single-spore establishment. This indicates that even isolated habitats receive dense and diverse spore rains, including genotypes capable of self-fertilization. Limited gene flow may conserve the genetic signature of multiple long-distance colonization events for several decades."

The cpDNA technique allowed us to investigate the mode of hybrid formation between sexual species for the first time over a wide geographic range and with a large sample rite. Morphological variation in this hybrid has previously been attributed to different reciprocal parental combinations, and to the influence of chloroplast genes on morphogenesis. Our results demonstrate that one parent, A. septentrionale s.l., acts predominantly as the female parent in these hybrids, with only one population of A. x alternifolium showing reciprocal hybridity. The discovery of predominantly unidirectional hybrid formation in this hybrid may be explained by the different breeding systems of the parental taxa.

Evidence from pteridophytes.","Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","66: 23-37.","Summary Paper","","","","In this paper we demonstrate that, by investigating polyploid complexes in Asplenium, it is possible to locate the areas in Europe that are southern glacial refugia, and are likely to have been so since the beginning of the Pleistocene during the consecutive cold and warm periods in Europe. Identification and conservation of these specific areas that serve as safe havens for plants, and perhaps animals, is of paramount importance for the maintenance of European biodiversity because Man’s activities are resulting in an ever-increasing loss of natural habitats and putting diversity at risk. The genus Asplenium in Europe comprises some 50 taxa: half of these are diploid while the other half are polyploids derived from the diploids. All aspleniums in Europe are (small) rock ferns with high substrate specificity. Today, most of mainland Europe, Scandinavia and the British Isles has been colonized by polyploid Asplenium species, while the diploids that gave rise to these polyploids are distributed around (and more or less confined to) the Mediterranean Basin. In the tetraploids genetic variation is partitioned mostly between sites, whereas diploids show a high degree of genetic variation both within and between sites. The tetraploid taxa seem capable of single spore colonization via intragametophytic selfing, but the diploid taxa appear to be predominantly outbreeding. For most diploids at least two gametophytes, produced by different spores, have to be present to achieve fertilization and subsequent sporophyte formation for the successful colonization of a new site. This results in a slower rate of colonization. The formation of auto- and allopolyploid taxa from diploid communities appears to have been a recurrent and common feature in Europe. Minority cytotype exclusion is likely to prevent the establishment of tetraploids within the diploid communities, but spores from tetraploids can establish populations outside the diploid communities. The differences between colonization abilities of tetraploid and ancestral diploid taxa, resulting from their different breeding systems, has prevented the merging and mingling of their ranges and led to the establishment of contact/ hybrid zones. This has resulted in the restriction of diploid populations to ancient glacial refugia and the colonization of the rest of Europe by polyploids. Mapping the current distribution of these diploid communities and comparing the genetic diversity within and between outbreeding diploid Asplenium taxa allows us to define the area, age and historical biogeography of these refugia and to assess their importance for present day genetic and species diversity in Europe."

The origins of A. x alternifolium, the hybrid between A. trichomanes s.l. and A. septentrionale s.l. was studied at three ploidy levels, diploid, triploid and tetraploid. The cpDNA technique allowed us to investigate the mode of hybrid formation between sexual species for the first time over a wide geographic range and with a large sample rite. Morphological variation in this hybrid has previously been attributed to different reciprocal parental combinations, and to the influence of chloroplast genes on morphogenesis. Our results demonstrate that one parent, A. septentrionale s.l., acts predominantly as the female parent in these hybrids, with only one population of A. x alternifolium showing reciprocal hybridity. The discovery of predominantly unidirectional hybrid formation in this hybrid may be explained by the different breeding systems of the parental taxa. The role of gametophyte ecology is also assessed."

Asplenium trichomanes subsp, quadrivalens is one of the most common and most widespread ferns in Europe. In this study we have combined genetic investigations, spatial autocorrelation, and breeding experiments to investigate in detail five populations from natural rock faces. Enzyme electrophoresis revealed very low genetic variability within and among the populations. The small amount of variation was partitioned mainly among the localities, indicated by high F-st values up to 0.764. Overall means of the proportion of polymorphic loci ((P) over bar = 0.076), the mean number of alleles per locus ((A) over bar = 1.086), and the mean expected heterozygosity ((H) over bar = 0.018) were low compared with other ferns (e.g., Kirkpatrick et al. 1990). Very few heterozygous individuals were found. Values of the fixation index (F) were high, ranging between 0.732 and 1.000 and indicating substantial inbreeding. Spatial autocorrelation showed different patterns of substructure in populations of A. trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens with a tendency for patches in short distances (up to 1.5 m). The breeding experiments with isolated prothalli and prothalli pairs showed that a mean of 56.4% of the isolated prothalli were successful in sporophyte formation. The highest rate in one population was 83.3%. We conclude that genetic load must be low in A. trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens. Sporophyte formation was statistically more successful in the experiments with gametophyte pairs than in isolates, indicating that additional cross-fertilization occurred. The latter agreed with the occurrence of few heterozygote samples and the small number of multilocus phenotypes found in natural habitats. Asplenium trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens is shown to be a highly inbreeding taxon with the capability of single spore colonization and subsequent founding of new populations. Such features can be hypothesized to have contributed to the postglacial colonization and the widespread distribution of this taxon in Europe."

The sampling included representatives of the three diploid and the four tetraploid taxa recognized in the European flora plus Macaronesia. Besides European samples, the compiled data set comprised specimens of a putative Hawaiian endemic and one species occurring in Southeast Asia. By combining the sequences of three non-coding plastid regions, 13 haplotypes were recovered of which four were found in more than one taxon. Evidences for four distinct diploid lineages were found that correspond to Asplenium anceps, A. inexpectans, A. trichomanes s.s., and A. tripteropus. The four tetraploids occurring in Europe shared haplotypes with A. inexpectans. Thus, DNA barcoding can successfully identify the diploids, but fail to separate the tetraploids from their diploid ancestors. As a consequence, barcoding analyses of ferns need to take into account the differences of ploidy level measured by evidence independent from the DNA barcode. Evidence for uneven accumulation of intra-species DNA variation was recovered by comparing all species. Furthermore, the study provided evidence that the current taxonomy of these ferns requires to be revised. The two European diploids form well-separated clades and need to be recognized as A. inexpectans and A. trichomanes s.s. To keep name consistency for all European tetraploids, a new name Asplenium jessenii is introduced to replace A. trichomanes subsp. hastatum."

Whether isolated populations indeed show this genetic signature of isolation depends on the amount and diversity of diaspores arriving by long-distance dispersal, and time since colonization. For ferns, however, reliable estimates of long-distance dispersal rates remain largely unknown, and previous studies on fern population genetics often sampled older or non-isolated populations. Young populations in recent, disjunct habitats form a useful study system to improve our understanding of the genetic impact of long-distance dispersal. Microsatellite markers were used to analyse the amount and distribution of genetic diversity in young populations of four widespread calcicole ferns (Asplenium scolopendrium, diploid; Asplenium trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens, tetraploid; Polystichum setiferum, diploid; and Polystichum aculeatum, tetraploid), which are rare in The Netherlands but established multiple populations in a forest (the Kuinderbos) on recently reclaimed Dutch polder land following long-distance dispersal. Reference samples from populations throughout Europe were used to assess how much of the existing variation was already present in the Kuinderbos. A large part of the Dutch and European genetic diversity in all four species was already found in the Kuinderbos. This diversity was strongly partitioned among populations. Most populations showed low genetic variation and high inbreeding coefficients, and were assigned to single, unique gene pools in cluster analyses. Evidence for interpopulational gene flow was low, except for the most abundant species. The results show that all four species, diploids as well as polyploids, were capable of frequent long-distance colonization via single-spore establishment. This indicates that even isolated habitats receive dense and diverse spore rains, including genotypes capable of self-fertilization. Limited gene flow may conserve the genetic signature of multiple long-distance colonization events for several decades."

The investigated populations of Asplenium septentrionale show only little genetic variability (isozyme variation) without gene flow among populations (based on the banding pattern of multi-locus phenotypes), and they persist for long periods despite the small population sizes. In Asplenium ruta-muraria, genetic variability is correlated with age. Young populations show no genetic variation, while old populations show some. All individuals of Polypodium vulgare investigated, either epiphytic or epilithic, share exactly the same enzyme phenotype. The results for these three species can be related to predominance of inbreeding, lack of inbreeding depression, polyploidy, long-distance dispersal, production of large amounts of diaspores, single-spore colonization, and perennial life cycles. Genetic variability in these three species does not seem to be absolutely necessary for the maintenance of their populations. Ecological and demographic factors are considered to be more important. An isolated, glacial relict population of diploid Asplenium viride shows high variability in two out of eight enzyme systems, which may be due to prevailing outbreeding. We discuss aspects of the importance of genetics and life history for conservation biology."

The spore banks from the different soil samples within and between populations revealed a considerable amount of genetic diversity. The most frequent alleles within the two sporophyte populations were, with a few exceptions, also the most frequent within the spore banks. The influence of single sporophytic individuals on the genetic composition of microsites seems to be considerably reduced by stochastic processes such as soil movement or the action of earthworms, which promote the mixing of spores from different spatial and temporal origins. It was shown that spores remain viable after passing through the gut of earthworms and that spore banks from even small soil samples revealed genetic diversity and could lead to a large number of genetically distinct sporophytes.

This contrasts with results found in similar studies of herbaceous flowering plants where genetic adaptation to gradients like altitude is common. However, when data from the more distant Italian and Spanish populations of A. filix-femina were included, significant variation was detected."

When this prediction was tested empirically using data from the literature for species of angiosperms and gymnosperms, the distribution of outcrossing rates for all species was clearly bimodal. To provide another empirical test of the prediction, we analyzed mating-system data for 20 species of Pteridophyta (ferns). Homosporous ferns and their allies are unique among vascular plants because three types of mating are possible: intragametophytic selfing (selfing of an individual gametophyte); intergametophytic selfing (analogous to selfing in seed plants); and intergametophytic crossing (analogous to outcrossing in seed plants). The distribution of intragametophytic selfing rates among species of homosporous ferns is clearly uneven. Most species of homosporous ferns would be classified as extreme outcrossers. In contrast, a few species are nearly exclusively inbreeding. In only a few populations of Dryopteris expansa and Hemionitis palmata and a single population of Blechnum spicant do we see convincing evidence of a mixed mating system. The uneven distribution of selfing rates we observed for homosporous ferns, coupled with a corresponding bimodality of the magnitude of genetic load, strongly supports the model."

The lunaria clade (two species) was sister to the simplex-campestre clade (five species) which contained two weakly supported subclades. Single populations of B. lunaria and B. simplex were more closely related to other species in the same geographic region than to populations of their own species from distant geographic regions. In a second analysis that included both diploid and polyploid species, eight of twelve polyploid taxa had rbcL sequences identical to those of known diploids, which suggested relatively recent origins for these eight polyploid species. Four polyploids, B. ascendens, B. paradoxum, B. x watertonense, and B. minganense, did not associate with a diploid species, and therefore represented polyploid derivatives of diploid taxa that were not sampled and possibly are extinct. Associations of diploid and polyploid species as determined by rbcL analysis are consistent with morphological hypotheses of polyploid origins with the exception of B. ascendens, which did not possess the rbcL sequence of either of its putative diploid progenitors."

H. Wagner, can sometimes be confused in the field, even by experts, because of their reduced morphology. Botrychium minganense can imitate B. crenulatum, which is more rare. They are afforded different degrees of protection on Federal lands, making the distinctness of these species a question of management, conservation, and systematic interest. The purpose of this study was to compare a morphometric analysis of these two species with an analysis of DNA markers from the same individuals, and to assess their distinctness under each method. Collections were made in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana from seven populations of B. crenulatum and 18 populations of B. mingunense. Each plant was measured, emphasizing characters cited by authors in the original species descriptions. Canonical variate analysis performed on SAS separated the samples into two species groups with 32% overlap. RAPD genetic markers revealed more genetic variation than has previously been documented in moonworts. UPGMA cluster analysis of the similarity of RAPD profiles showed well-defined B. mingonense and B. crenulatum clusters, but no distinct clusters within B. minganense that could be correlated with its morphological variability. Small samples of the moonwort species B. lunaria and B. simplex included for comparison also formed distinct clusters. Botrychium crenulatum had seven unique RAPD bands, and identification of B. crenulatum could be confirmed or ruled out with markers from one or two RAPD primers. Both B. crenulatum and B. Junaria have been suggested as possible diploid parents of tetraploid B. mingonense. All RAPD markers absent in B. crenulatum but present in B. minganense were also present or polymorphic in B. lunaria, supporting B. lunaria as a possible parent. One very small population of B. minganense showed a monomorphic RAPD profile, consistent with inbreeding, but all other populations had multiple genotypes. Some plants of B. minganense clustered most closely with plants from populations up to 400 km away, suggesting that variation may be introduced into populations by occasional colonization by spores from distant sources."

In the Arctic, global warming has already caused vegetation change across the region and is acting as a significant stressor on Arctic biodiversity. Many of the rare plants in the Arctic are relicts from early Holocene warm periods, but their ability to benefit from the current warming is dependent on the viability of their populations. We therefore examined Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) data from regional red listed vascular plant species in the High Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and reference populations from the main distribution area of: (1) Botrychium lunaria, (2) Carex capillaris ssp. fuscidula, (3) Comastoma tenellum, (4) Kobresia simpliciuscula ssp. subholarctica, (5) Ranunculus wilanderi, (6) Sibbaldia procumbens and (7) Tofieldia pusilla. In addition, we gathered population size data in Svalbard. The Svalbard populations had low genetic diversity and distinctiveness and few or no private markers compared to populations outside the archipelago. This is similar to observations in other rare species in Svalbard and the genetic depletion may be due to an initial founder effect and/or a genetic bottleneck caused by late Holocene cooling. There seems to be limited gene flow from other areas and the Svalbard populations should therefore be considered as demographically independent management units. Overall, these management units have small and/or few populations and are therefore prone to stochastic events which may further increase vulnerability to inbreeding depression, loss of genetic variation, and reduced evolutionary potential. Our results support theory predicting lower levels of genetic diversity in small, isolated and/or peripheral populations and may be of importance for management of other rare plant species in the Arctic."

These biological processes are at the same time strongly influenced by the geomorphological heterogeneity of the habitat. The individuals' genetic variation was detected as multilocus RAPD profile. The spatially constrained portion of genetic variance within subpopulations was studied by means of variograms, i.e., the average genetic dissimilarity between the pairs of organisms against the separation distance. The range of reduced dissimilarity was 11-13 m. Mantel test proved that subpopulations are isolated by distance. The connected local population patches may create a metapopulation structure.

In addition, an electrophoretic study of isozymes was carried out on frond samples from five natural populations, as an additional source of evidence concerning the breeding system and the genetic structure of sporophyte populations. Populations throughout the Iberian range of the species were selected for this study, and a Scottish population was included to represent plants from outside our local area and ecology. The morphological development of gametophytes is of the Adiantum type. All multispore cultures developed into a bigametophytic system consisting in most cases of male and female prothalli. This pattern of sexual expression provides evidence for outcrossing as the main breeding system in this species. Moreover, there is good evidence that the species possesses an antheridiogen system to promote outcrossing. The long time needed by gametophytes to produce gametangia, and afterwards to fertilize and produce sporophytes, might be the primary reason why so few young sporophytes are found in the wild. The values of the percentage of polymorphic loci and the similarity levels obtained from the isozyme analyses indicate a level of genetic variability that would be expected in an outcrossing species. All these characteristics are usually associated with diploid fern species rather than polyploid species."

The use of a more sensitive marker, such as microsatellites, was thus needed to reveal the genetic diversity, breeding system and spatial genetic structure of this species in natural populations. Eight microsatellite loci for D. aemula were developed and their cross-amplification with other ferns was tested. Five polymorphic loci were used to characterize the amount and distribution of genetic diversity of D. aemula in three populations from the Iberian Peninsula and one population from the Azores. Most microsatellite markers developed were transferable to taxa close to D. aemula. Overall genetic variation was low (H-T = 0 center dot 447), but was higher in the Azorean population than in the Iberian populations of this species. Among-population genetic differentiation was high (F-ST = 0 center dot 520). All loci strongly departed from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In the population where genetic structure was studied, no spatial autocorrelation was found in any distance class. The higher genetic diversity observed in the Azorean population studied suggested a possible refugium in this region from which mainland Europe has been recolonized after the Pleistocene glaciations. High among-population genetic differentiation indicated restricted gene flow (i.e. lack of spore exchange) across the highly fragmented area occupied by D. aemula. The deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium reflected strong inbreeding in D. aemula, a trait rarely observed in homosporous ferns. The absence of spatial genetic structure indicated effective spore dispersal over short distances. Additionally, the cross-amplification of some D. aemula microsatellites makes them suitable for use in other Dryopteris taxa."

The fern Dryopteris Xtriploidea, the "backcross" hybrid between the diploid D. intermedia and the tetraploid D. carthusiana, occurs in large numbers in nature, providing an opportunity to investigate whether such a bias exists. Differences in the chloroplast genome distinguishing the two parental species were discovered in the sequence of the trnL region following amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), including a Mse I restriction site. This allowed rapid identification of the donor of the chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal parent of each hybrid, assuming chloroplast DNA to be maternally inherited in Dryopteris,is. Analysis was carried out on 127 hybrids, shown to be of independent origin using allozymes, occurring at three localities in Virginia and West Virginia. When samples from all localities were pooled, 91 possessed the D. carthusiana trnL, genotype and 36 possessed the D. intermedia genotype, a ratio that is significantly different (P < 0.001) from the null hypothesis of no gender bias. The strength of the bias differed significantly among the three sites, however, with bias at the West Virginia site much stronger (5.6:1 carthusiana:intermedia; P < 0.001) than at either Virginia site (1.55:1 and 1.43:1 carthusiana:intermedia, respectively; P > 0.05 in both cases). Thr: cause of the strong bias in the West Virginia sample is unknown, as is the cause of the population differences. Causes of bias could include differences between the parental species related to their ploidy difference, including sizes of gametes and/or gametangia, sperm motility, breeding system (D. intermedia is outcrossing while D. carthusiana is selfing), or the nature and strength of interspecific isolating mechanisms."

Evidence from extinct species can provide links for reconstructing intricate patterns of reticulate relationships among extant descendents. When fossils are unavailable and other evidence yields competing hypotheses to explain species ancestry, data from proteins and DNA can help resolve conflicts and generate novel perspectives. The identity of a parent shared by two tetraploid species in the cosmopolitan fern genus Dryopteris has remained elusive for more than 50 years. Based on available data, four hypotheses were developed previously, each providing a different resolution to this uncertainty. Methods: New molecular evidence from studies of isozymes and restriction site analysis of chloroplast DNA tested the competing hypotheses about the diploid ancestors of these two extant Dryopteris polyploids. Key results: The results falsify two of the hypotheses, resolve the uncertainty in the third, and support the fourth. Conclusions: Our data validate the prior existence of Dryopteris "semicristata," which was proposed 38 years ago as a diploid progenitor of the allotetraploids D. cristata and D. carthusiana but has never been collected.

Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) diversity of 280 individuals from 14 populations of D. cristata was extraordinarily low, suggesting an ancient bottleneck in the species.' history. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of 25 different RAPD multiband phenotypes revealed significant genetic variation among three geographical regions (15%) and among populations within regions (34%); 51% of total variance was attributed to variation within populations. High population differentiation indicated limited gene flow among populations, and genetic divergence was not correlated with geographical distance. There was no relationship between genetic variation within population, estimated as molecular variance, and present-day population size. Populations with recent historical bottlenecks of fewer than 25 individuals showed a substantial and significant reduction in genetic variation, compared with populations without bottlenecks. Comparatively high levels of genetic variation were still maintained in small remnants, (60-110 individuals), of formerly large populations. Average deviations of frequencies of widespread polymorphic markers within populations from their frequencies in the whole dataset were significantly higher in small or recently bottlenecked populations than in constantly large populations, thus providing evidence for random sampling effects during genetic bottlenecks and drift in small populations. The present investigation demonstrates the importance of population history for understanding present-day genetic diversity within natural populations, as well as for conservation biology."

Evidence from extinct species can provide links for reconstructing intricate patterns of reticulate relationships among extant descendents. When fossils are unavailable and other evidence yields competing hypotheses to explain species ancestry, data from proteins and DNA can help resolve conflicts and generate novel perspectives. The identity of a parent shared by two tetraploid species in the cosmopolitan fern genus Dryopteris has remained elusive for more than 50 years. Based on available data, four hypotheses were developed previously, each providing a different resolution to this uncertainty. Methods: New molecular evidence from studies of isozymes and restriction site analysis of chloroplast DNA tested the competing hypotheses about the diploid ancestors of these two extant Dryopteris polyploids. Key results: The results falsify two of the hypotheses, resolve the uncertainty in the third, and support the fourth. Conclusions: Our data validate the prior existence of Dryopteris "semicristata," which was proposed 38 years ago as a diploid progenitor of the allotetraploids D. cristata and D. carthusiana but has never been collected. After developing a phylogeny using the new molecular data, we describe a plausible morphology for D. "semicristata" by extrapolating likely character states from related extant species."

When this prediction was tested empirically using data from the literature for species of angiosperms and gymnosperms, the distribution of outcrossing rates for all species was clearly bimodal. To provide another empirical test of the prediction, we analyzed mating-system data for 20 species of Pteridophyta (ferns). Homosporous ferns and their allies are unique among vascular plants because three types of mating are possible: intragametophytic selfing (selfing of an individual gametophyte); intergametophytic selfing (analogous to selfing in seed plants); and intergametophytic crossing (analogous to outcrossing in seed plants). The distribution of intragametophytic selfing rates among species of homosporous ferns is clearly uneven. Most species of homosporous ferns would be classified as extreme outcrossers. In contrast, a few species are nearly exclusively inbreeding. In only a few populations of Dryopteris expansa and Hemionitis palmata and a single population of Blechnum spicant do we see convincing evidence of a mixed mating system. The uneven distribution of selfing rates we observed for homosporous ferns, coupled with a corresponding bimodality of the magnitude of genetic load, strongly supports the model."

In order to study the evolutionary origin of an apomictic fern species, we investigated the genetic variation in the strictly agamosporous Dryopteris remota. We determined the genotypes of 22 individuals from many different locations within the species' European distribution and of 20 individuals from a Swiss population. A previous study on isozyme variation showed no intraspecific genetic variation in a similar sample set (Schneller and Holderegger, 1994, America Fern Journal 84: 94- 98). In contrast to this, four out of 12 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers tested revealed low genetic diversity among individuals of D. remota from different locations. Intrapopulational genetic variation was also very low, but in the single population studied, a unique multiband genotype could be detected. The geographic distribution of genetic variation found in D. remota was best explained by the assumption of a single origin, the accumulation of somatic mutations during spread, and occasional, but effective, events of dispersal over large distances. The present study thus stresses the importance of long-distance dispersal in evolutionary processes and biogeography of ferns."

The investigated populations of Asplenium septentrionale show only little genetic variability (isozyme variation) without gene flow among populations (based on the banding pattern of multi-locus phenotypes), and they persist for long periods despite the small population sizes. In Asplenium ruta-muraria, genetic variability is correlated with age. Young populations show no genetic variation, while old populations show some. All individuals of Polypodium vulgare investigated, either epiphytic or epilithic, share exactly the same enzyme phenotype. The results for these three species can be related to predominance of inbreeding, lack of inbreeding depression, polyploidy, long-distance dispersal, production of large amounts of diaspores, single-spore colonization, and perennial life cycles. Genetic variability in these three species does not seem to be absolutely necessary for the maintenance of their populations. Ecological and demographic factors are considered to be more important. An isolated, glacial relict population of diploid Asplenium viride shows high variability in two out of eight enzyme systems, which may be due to prevailing outbreeding. We discuss aspects of the importance of genetics and life history for conservation biology."

Sixteen pairs were genotyped and evaluated for variability within and among three populations in North Carolina, Vermont, and New Hampshire. Twelve of these primer pairs were reliable and polymorphic, exhibiting one to 10 alleles per locus. Cross-species amplification experiments were conducted for P. virginianum and four additional close relatives from the P. vulgare complex in order to maximize information about likely utility within a phylogenetic context.

Whether isolated populations indeed show this genetic signature of isolation depends on the amount and diversity of diaspores arriving by long-distance dispersal, and time since colonization. For ferns, however, reliable estimates of long-distance dispersal rates remain largely unknown, and previous studies on fern population genetics often sampled older or non-isolated populations. Young populations in recent, disjunct habitats form a useful study system to improve our understanding of the genetic impact of long-distance dispersal. Microsatellite markers were used to analyse the amount and distribution of genetic diversity in young populations of four widespread calcicole ferns (Asplenium scolopendrium, diploid; Asplenium trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens, tetraploid; Polystichum setiferum, diploid; and Polystichum aculeatum, tetraploid), which are rare in The Netherlands but established multiple populations in a forest (the Kuinderbos) on recently reclaimed Dutch polder land following long-distance dispersal. Reference samples from populations throughout Europe were used to assess how much of the existing variation was already present in the Kuinderbos. A large part of the Dutch and European genetic diversity in all four species was already found in the Kuinderbos. This diversity was strongly partitioned among populations. Most populations showed low genetic variation and high inbreeding coefficients, and were assigned to single, unique gene pools in cluster analyses. Evidence for interpopulational gene flow was low, except for the most abundant species. The results show that all four species, diploids as well as polyploids, were capable of frequent long-distance colonization via single-spore establishment.

Two distinct rDNA repeat types were present in all individuals of Polystichum examined. No variation was detected among individuals within a population of P. munitum, among populations of P. munitum or P. imbricans, or among the six diploid species of Polystichum from North America, including the circumboreal P. lonchitis. The identity of rDNA repeats across all six North American species of Polystichum may reflect an overall similarity of the nuclear genomes of these species, an observation supported by isozyme data as well. However, this nuclear similarity contrasts sharply with the highly divergent chloroplast genomes of these six species. The conservative nature of the rDNA in Polystichum also is in contrast to the much more variable rDNAs of most angiosperms investigated. Perhaps the tempo and mode of evolution of rDNA in ferns differ from those of angiosperms; however, the data base for fern rDNA is very small. Furthermore, the number of repeat types per individual is consistent with a diploid, rather than polyploid, condition despite the high chromosome number (n = 41) of these plants, although homogenization of multiple, divergent rRNA genes cannot be disproven."

Ramets (individual leaves) were sampled at intervals of 165 m (or less in some cases) and genotyped for six polymorphic isozyme loci to produce a map depicting the spatial patterning of genets. Forty-five distinct genotypes were detected, 14 of which were sampled more than once, five of these more than four times. Genotype proportions at all loci except Pgm-1 conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Estimation of allele frequencies in the population used a ''round-robin'' approach that removed any upward bias for rare alleles that distinguish genets. Based on these allele frequencies, the probability that each genotype could arise independently and be sampled was calculated. Some genotypes represented by widely separated ramets had very low probabilities of re-encounter, documenting fragmentation of widespread genets. Coarse-scale mapping indicated a population consisting of many small genets and a few very large ones (up to 1,015 m across). The larger genets tended to be irregular in shape, fragmented, and overlapping. Fine scale mapping of individual fronds in spatially discrete patches of ramets revealed extensive intergrowth of genets, indicating that P. aquilinum exhibits a ''guerrilla-type'' clonal morphology."

T. speciosum is unique amongst European pteridophytes in that both phases of the life cycle are perennial and capable of vegetative propagation. Within sites no variation was revealed by allozyme electrophoresis, even where both generations were growing together. In contrast, diversity was observed among sites, with seven different multilocus phenotypes (MLPs) present in the area. Two of these MLPs covered large areas while the others were restricted to one, or few localities. Asexual reproduction of the gametophyte via gemmae is assumed to be the main means of dispersal in recent times, allowing single clones to become widespread, while the overall genetic variability may be attributed to sexual reproduction and spore dispersal in historic times under more favourable climatic conditions. We suggest that it is not inbreeding, nor lack of genetic variation that limits sporophyte production, but rather the prevailing climatic conditions. The sporophyte is extremely rare and vulnerable. However, when the gametophyte is considered, the species is neither threatened with extinction, nor does it appear to face the danger of marked genetic erosion, because the long-lived gametophyte stage contains all of the genetic variability present in the area and can be regarded as a valuable ‘seed-bank’."

Genetic variation has been investigated at 35 sites. Allozyme diversity is partitioned primarily between, not within, sites. Although genetic variation exists at a fine scale (<5 m) within some populations, the results suggest that clones were not intimately associated in these cases. The majority of sites support unique multilocus phenotypes. Where phenotypes were present at more than one site they tended to recur at the next closest site. However, similar phenotypes link eastern and western Pfalzerwald sites up to c. 70 km apart. This pattern of diversity suggests that colonisation was not solely of a "stepping stone" or "leading edge" type. We suggest that during a climatically favourable period, probably the Atlantic hypsithermal, there may have been an explosive colonisation by long-distance dispersal from refugial areas. This was followed by a short period during which sporophyte production, sexual reproduction and local spread were possible. With climatic change, reduction in the available habitat and the loss of the sporophyte generation, different individual genets became fixed within small, favourable, but scattered, sites. The possibility that some central European sites north of the Alps acted as periglacial refugia cannot be discounted, but would appear less likely than (re-)colonisation from the Atlantic fringe."
