Because of its unparalleled biological and genomic resources, the potential of Arabidopsis for molecular genetic analysis of this natural variation has increased dramatically in recent years. Scope Advanced genomics has accelerated molecular phylogenetic analysis and gene identification by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and/or association mapping in Arabidopsis. In particular, QTL mapping utilizing natural accessions is now becoming a major strategy of gene isolation, offering an alternative to artificial mutant lines. Furthermore, the genomic information is used by researchers to uncover the signature of natural selection acting on the genes that contribute to phenotypic variation. The evolutionary significance of such genes has been evaluated in traits such as disease resistance and flowering time. However, although molecular hallmarks of selection have been found for the genes in question, a corresponding ecological scenario of adaptive evolution has been difficult to prove. Ecological strategies, including reciprocal transplant experiments and competition experiments. and utilizing near-isogenic lines of alleles of interest will be a powerful tool to measure the relative fitness of phenotypic and/or allelic variants. Conclusions As the plant model organism, Arabidopsis provides a wealth of molecular background information for evolutionary genetics. Because genetic diversity between and within Arabidopsis populations is much higher than anticipated, combining this background information with ecological approaches might well establish Arabidopsis as a model organism for plant evolutionary ecology."

 (Orchidaceae). Most of the studies have focused on the allotetraploid
 members of the genus in general and on D. majalis ssp. lapponica in
 particular. It was concluded that most of the allotetraploid taxa have
 derived from hybridizations between the parental lineages D. maculata
 s.l. and D. incarnata s.l., with D. maculata s.l. serving as the seed
 parent. Evidence of multiple origins was found both among northern
 European allotetraploids as well as among Greek allotetraploids.
 Introgression from both parental lineages and hybridizations between
 independently derived polyploid lineages was also detected. The three
 morphologically similar taxa D. majalis ssp. traunsteineri, ssp.
 lapponica and ssp. russowii should be treated as one and most of the
 Greek allotetraploids should be regarded as regional variants of the
 southeastern European D. majalis ssp. cordigera. The Balkans and the
 Alps most probably served as refugia for the genus during the last
 glaciations and at least two waves of immigration reached Scandinavia.
 Finally, we suggest that the conservation of allotetraploid
 Dactylorhiza should emphasize important geographic areas and habitats
 and that the allopolyploids should have the same conservation status as
 the diploids."

Fossilized pollen, plant micro- and macrofossil records provided evidences on the large-scale species' range shifts and demographic changes during the Quaternary. Populations of Scots pine were documented both in the glacial (incl. full glaciation) and interglacial periods. Recolonization of Europe after the glaciation originated from the (Sub) Mediterranean areas like the Balkan Peninsula but also from around the Eastern Alps and the surroundings of the Danube plain. Fennoscandia and northern European Baltic regions were most probably colonized from two main directions, from Western Europe and from the Russian Plain. Modern history of Scots pine was hardly affected by anthropogenic activities that started to strengthen in the Bronze and Iron Age. Along with the fossil records, molecular genetic tools were used to infer the origin and putative history including migration, differentiation and demography of the species. In this paper we compiled the major publications (30) of molecular genetic studies of the past 20 years derived from distinctly inherited organelle genomes (mitochondrial, chloroplast, nuclear) revealed by different marker systems (mtDNA-cox1, -nad1, -nad3, -nad7, ISSR, cpSSR, nSSR, B-SAP, SNP). It is important to consider that different phylogeographic patterns can be drawn by the analysis of different DNA marker types. Accordingly the use of more than one marker simultaneously outlines the most sophisticated phylogeographical pattern on the genetic lineages and can reveal high differentiation of the European distribution. Combined marker systems and markers derived from coding sequences have also been used to detect species' phylogeographic patterns, but these were rarely applied to Scots pine. Although new molecular techniques can provide higher resolution data for populations, the reviewed results can shape the direction of further studies."

(Asteraceae): avoidance of mating constraints imposed by low S-allele number.","Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences","358: 1047-1050.","Summary Paper","","","","Senecio squalidus L. (Asteraceae) has been the subject of several ecological and population genetic studies due to its well-documented history of introduction, establishment and spread throughout Britain in the past 300 years. Our recent studies have focused on identifying and quantifying factors associated with the sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI) system of S. squalidus that may have contributed to its success as a colonist. These findings are of general biological interest because they provide important insights into the short-term evolutionary dynamics of a plant mating system. The number of S-alleles in populations and their dominance interactions were investigated in eight wild British populations using cross-diallel studies. The numbers of S- alleles in British S. squalidus populations are typically low (average of 5.3 S-alleles) and the entire British population is estimated to possess no more than 7-11 S-alleles. Such low numbers of S-alleles are most probably a consequence of population bottlenecks associated with introduction and colonization. Potential evolutionary impacts on SSI caused by a paucity of S-alleles, such as restricted mate availability, are discussed, and we suggest that increased dominance interactions between S-alleles may be an important short-term means of increasing mate availability when S-allele numbers are low."
