The expectation, therefore, would be that populations of Juniper are genetically diverse with little structuring between them. In Britain, the species has two main centres of distribution: a highland zone in the north and west, in which populations are still large and sexually reproducing, and a southern zone on chalk downlands in which populations are small and fragmented and individuals suffer from a decline in fertility. Thus, one would expect the large sexually viable populations in the north to exhibit high levels of within-population genetic variation, while the declining southern populations would be genetically depauperate. The analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) was used to test this hypothesis. Surprisingly, all populations studied showed high levels of genetic variation although there was clear structuring between populations. On the basis of the geographical structuring of the populations it was hypothesized that J. communis colonized Britain via three separate routes."

Many of the negative genetic impacts of population fragmentation can be ameliorated by gene flow and it has been suggested that in wind-pollinated tree species, high or even increased levels of gene flow are a feature of fragmented populations, although several studies have disputed this. We have used a combination of nuclear microsatellites and allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) analysis of chloroplast single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to examine the levels and patterns of genetic diversity and population differentiation in fragmented populations of juniper (Juniperus communis) in Ireland and inform conservation programs for the species. Significant population differentiation was found for both chloroplast and nuclear markers, indicating restricted gene flow, particularly over larger geographic scales. For conservation purposes, the existence of genetically distinct clusters and geographically localised chloroplast haplotypes suggests that the concept of provenance should be taken into account when formulating augmentation or reintroduction strategies. Furthermore, the potential lack of seed dispersal and seedling establishment means that ex-situ approaches to seed and seedling management may have to be considered."

Aside from ecological factors, inbreeding associated with reduced population size and isolation in the currently fragmented landscape might explain this decline. However, the breeding system of this species largely prevents inbreeding. We assessed variation in 18 allozyme loci in 12 Dutch juniper populations to investigate population structure and to test the hypothesis that small populations have less genetic variation and show more inbreeding than large populations. Variation was high for a species with a fragmented distribution, but similar to values observed in other juniper species. The proportion of polymorphic loci ( P ) ranged between 0.72 and 0.83, expected heterozygosity ( H e ) ranged between 0.16 and 0.27 and the mean effective number of alleles per locus ( A ) ranged between 2.5 and 3.3. Population size was not correlated with genetic variation or with sex ratio. Deviations from Hardy– Weinberg expectations, mainly heterozygote deficiencies, were mostly observed in larger populations, which appear to have been broken up into smaller subunits. Differentiation among populations was small ( F ST = 0.026) and there was a significant departure from random mating ( F IS = 0.174). Geographic and genetic structures were not related. Our data suggest that gene flow in this wind-pollinated shrub was high during the establishment phase of the current populations. Gene exchange by pollen and seeds may be less extensive in the present-day landscape. However, juniper decline is not likely to be caused by genetic factors. Alternative hypotheses include changed heathland disturbance regimes, pollen limitation, seed predation and age-related fecundity reductions. Implications for the restoration of juniper populations are discussed."

species to spread its genes across the landscape. The impact of landscape fragmentation on plant population
dynamics will therefore vary across different spatial scales. We quantified successful seed-mediated dispersal of the
dioecious shrub Juniperus communis in a fragmented landscape across northwestern Europe by using amplified
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Furthermore we investigated the genetic diversity and structure on
two spatial scales: across northwestern Europe and across Flanders (northern Belgium). We also studied whether
seed viability and populations size were correlated with genetic diversity.
Results: Unexpectedly, estimated seed-mediated dispersal rates were quite high and ranged between 3% and
14%. No population differentiation and no spatial genetic structure were detected on the local, Flemish scale.
A significant low to moderate genetic differentiation between populations was detected at the regional, northwest
European scale (PhiPT = 0.10). In general, geographically nearby populations were also genetically related. High
levels of within-population genetic diversity were detected but no correlation was found between any genetic
diversity parameter and population size or seed viability.
Conclusions: In northwestern Europe, landscape fragmentation has lead to a weak isolation-by-distance pattern
but not to genetic impoverishment of common juniper. Substantial rates of successful migration by seed-mediated
gene flow indicate a high dispersal ability which could enable Juniperus communis to naturally colonize suitable
habitats. However, it is not clear whether the observed levels of migration will suffice to counterbalance the effects
of genetic drift in small populations on the long run."

As a result, the existence of J. communis var. oblonga in North Caucasus and J. communis var. depressa in North America was confirmed, but genetic differences between J. communis var. communis and J. communis var. saxatilis were not detected in the main part of the Russian species range (European part of Russia, Ural, Siberia). These populations proved to be genetically uniform with the same predominant allelic frequencies, which may evidence recent settling of this species from one of Central or East European refugium. J. communis var. saxatilis from northeastern Russia inhabiting the region behind Verkhoyansk mountain and Russian Far East showed considerable differentiation in frequencies of alleles at three loci and geographical subdivision. These populations also exhibit high intrapopulation variation. This can be connected with the refugium in this territory. The origin of this group is probably connected with migrations from Central Asia (Tibet) in the direction to northeastern Russia along mountains connecting Central and North Asia. It is also assumed that migrations of this species previously proceeded across the Beringian land bridge."

In a preliminary screening for variation using a polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism approach, two length variants were identified. By fully sequencing the 2.5 kb region, the observed length polymorphism was found to result from the insertion of a 31 bp sequence, with no other mutations observed within the intron. A set of primers was designed flanking the observed mutation, which identified a novel sequence-tagged-site mitochondrial marker for P. sylvestris .

Recent debate on genetic management prescriptions has been conducted with insufficient access to sound scientific information. This paper attempts to remedy this by: (1) presenting an overview of genetic variation and the processes which control it; (2) reviewing current measures; and (3) proposing a range of improvements ti, policy and practice. Genetic variation in Scottish tree and shrub populations is a neglected field of research, except for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Some useful information can be provided by considering the history, ecology and biology of species together with genetic theory. Current patterns of variation reflect both the historical origins (as demonstrated by biochemical markers) and adaptation through natural selection (as indicated by provenance research). Existing populations probably still retain significant elements of adaptive variation; though this will vary according to species, with some showing close correlation between patterns of adaptive variation and environmental factors and others being more plastic. Indigenous genepools have been modified by fragmentation, changes in the forest environment, and introduction of foreign material, much of which is maladapted to upland sites. With some exceptions, the levels of genetic variation in existing indigenous populations comprise an adequate basis for restoring and expanding native woodland. The current undiscriminating use of continental provenances needs to be strongly discouraged; but equally restricting choice of seed sources to the most local provenances can also be inappropriate. Use of Scottish material from the same region and similar site type as the planting site needs to be encouraged. Current genetic management measures are rudimentary and fail to address adequately key issues of provenance choice, genetic conservation, seed supply or provision of selected or improved material, especially in broadleaves. Changes in legislation, regulation, seed supply, advice and research are proposed to address these shortcomings. The need for more provenance research is highlighted."

The diversity levels were higher than those reported in similar studies in other Pinus species. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that small (3.24-8.81%) but significant (P less than or equal to 0.001) portions of the variation existed between the populations and that there was no significant difference between the Scottish and the mainland European populations. Evidence of population substructure was found in the Rannoch population, which exhibited two subgroups. Finally, one of the loci studied exhibited an allele distribution uncharacteristic of the stepwise mutation model of evolution of simple-sequence repeats, and sequencing of the PCR products revealed that this was due to a duplication rather than slippage in the repeat region.

Location The study was carried out throughout Europe. Methods An extended set of data of pollen and macrofossil remains was used to locate the glacial refugia and reconstruct the migrating routes of P. sylvestris throughout Europe. A vegetation model was used to simulate the extent of the potential refugia during the last glacial period. At the same time a genetic survey was carried out on this species. Results The simulated distribution of P. sylvestris during the last glacial period is coherent with the observed fossil data, which showed a patchy distribution of the refugia between c. 40 degrees N and 50 degrees N. Several migrational fronts were detected within the Iberian and the Italian peninsulas, and outside the Hungarian plain and around the Alps. The modern mitochondrial DNA depicted three different haplotypes for P. sylvestris. Two distinct haplotypes were restricted to northern Spain and Italy, and the third haplotype dominated most of the present-day remaining distribution range of P. sylvestris in Europe. Main concluions During the last glacial period P. sylvestris was constrained under severe climatic conditions to survive in scattered and restricted refugial areas. Combining palaeoenvironmental data, vegetation modelling and the genetic data, we have shown that the long-term isolation in the glacial refugia and the migrational process during the Holocene have played a major role in shaping the modern genetic diversity of P. sylvestris in Europe."

The growth rates of European continental provenances of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), silver birch (Betula pendula), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and common alder (Alnus glutinosa) were inferior to those of British provenances in 90 per cent of cases. European provenances of these species also showed inferior survival. The growth rates of continental provenances of beech (Fagus sylvatica) were superior to British provenances in about 50 per cent of cases, provenances from northern France, Belgium and Holland being the fastest growing. Relationships between the relative height growth of foreign provenances and latitude were demonstrated for Scots pine, silver birch and beech (relative height growth = the height growth of a foreign provenance expressed relative to that of British provenances at the same site). The continental provenances that grew best originated at 0-4-degrees-south of the latitudes of the planting sites. Relative height growth decreased both north and south of these latitudes. In the case of oak, relative height growth did not vary widely between origins. The survival of continental provenances of Scots pine was particularly poor on exposed upland sites. The stem form of British provenances of Scots pine was intermediate between Fennoscandian provenances and provenances from the rest of Europe. In oak and beech there was generally little difference in stem form between British and continental provenances, but the best continental provenances (Belgian beech; French oak) were most reliable. The growth and survival of native trees is interpreted in the light of the post-glacial history of these species. The implications regarding the continued use of seed of native hardwoods imported from continental Europe are discussed."

Although Scots pine is characterized by larger populations and a wider natural range than Swiss stone pine, the genetic diversity values did not generally differ to a similar degree or in the direction expected. While Scots pine possesses higher diversity at several enzyme loci, Swiss stone pine reaches the same degree of diversity or even a higher degree at other loci. Interestingly, the greatest differences in gene diversity between the 2 pine species were detected for isozyme-gene- systems that differ in the number of controlling loci, suggesting that variable allozymes at only 1 (or 2) loci and invariant isozymes at multiple loci are alternate forms of enzyme adaptation in the 2 species.

The effective population sizes of these species are known to have ranged from the very small bottlenecks of P. resinosa to vast populations of P. sylvestris. This background allowed us to place the microsatellite evolution in a well-defined phylogenetic setting. Of 30 loci originating from P. strobus and P. radiata, we were able to consistently amplify 4 in most of the these pine species. These priming sites had been conserved for over 100 Myr. The four microsatellites were sequenced in the five species. Flanking sequences were compared to establish that the loci were orthologous. All microsatellites had persisted in these species, despite very different population sizes.

Part of the ESTP markers (40) were developed and mapped earlier in Pinus taeda, and additional markers were generated based on P. sylvestris sequences or sequences from other pine species. The mapping in P. sylvestris was based on 94 F-1 progeny from a cross between plus-tree parents E635C and E1101. AFLP framework maps for the parent trees were first constructed. The ESTP and other gene sequence-based markers were added to the framework maps, as well as five published microsatellite loci. The separate maps were then integrated with the aid of AFLPs segregating in both trees (dominant segregation ratios 3:1) as well as gene markers and microsatellites segregating in both parent trees (segregation ratios 1:1:1:1 or 1:2:1). The integrated map consisted of 12 groups corresponding to the P. taeda linkage groups, and additionally three and six smaller groups for E1101 and E635C, respectively. The number of framework AFLP markers in the integrated map is altogether 194 and the number of gene markers 61. The total length of the integrated map was 1,314 cM. The set of markers developed for P. sylvestris was also added to existing maps of two P. taeda pedigrees. Starting with a mapped marker from one pedigree in the source species resulted in a mapped marker in a pedigree of the other species in more than 40% of the cases, with about equal success in both directions. The maps of the two species are largely colinear, even if the species have diverged more than 70 MYA. Most cases of different locations were probably due to problems in identifying the orthologous members of gene families. These data provide a first ESTP-containing map of P. sylvestris, which can also be used for comparing this species to additional species mapped with the same markers."

The inheritance of all but about 8.4% of the amplified bands has been confirmed to be Mendelian. We compared band patterns among selected P. sylvestris trees from northern Sweden, two Asian species of Pinus and one species from the genus Picea. The dendrogram obtained was generally concordant with the taxonomic data, although the genetic similarity values between trees from different genera did not entirely follow accepted inter- and intraspecific relationships. This deviation was less pronounced using primer combinations that generated fewer bands. More than 69.1% of the bands that were polymorphic in two P. sylvestris trees or 29 of their F-1 progeny were in a pseudo-testcross configuration and thus were useful for the development of a linkage map for each parent. These markers have been analysed in four other crosses, and 83% of the bands could be mapped in at least one cross.

On average, seed trees of the small population showed an eight-fold higher selfing rate (25 vs. 3%) and a 100- fold greater incidence of correlated paternity (19.6 vs. 0.2%) than did trees from the large populations. No evidence was found of pollen limitation within the remnant stand, as suggested by ovule abortion rates. Investigation of the mating patterns in the small population, based on the unambiguous genealogy of 778 open-pollinated seeds, showed a large departure from random mating. Only 8% of the possible mating pairs within the stand were observed. Correlated paternity rate within a maternal sibship was negatively associated (r(s) = - 0.398, P < 0.050) with the distance to the nearest neighbour, and shared paternity among maternal sibships was negatively correlated (r(s) = -0.704, P < 0.001) with the distance between seed trees. Numerical simulations, based on the estimated individual pollen dispersal kernel, suggest that restricted dispersal might have been the key factor affecting mating patterns in the small population and, together with low population density, may account for the observed mating system variation between the small and the large populations. The results of this study show that a severe size reduction may substantially affect the mating system of a wind-pollinated, typically outcrossed plant species."

Using several different statistical techniques including analysis of variance, regression with the scaling recommended from the adaptive distance model, and multiple regression, no evidence of an association was found. For example, only between 7 and 8% of the regression tests were significant at the 5% level and half of these showed a positive association and half showed a negative association. Further, the multiple regression analysis explained on average only 5.8% of the variation observed in the six different traits and only 1.5% of this variation was explained by a positive association. Power analysis was carried out (for the first time on these type of data), both for the single locus heterozygous advantage and the association of individual multiple locus heterozygosity and the quantitative traits.

In addition, we developed paternal chloroplast (cp) DNA markers that distinguish P. densiflora from var 'lapponica', var 'armena' and var' mongolica'. UPGMA cluster analysis based on Nei's distances between all pair-wise combinations of the 22 populations revealed patterns corresponding strictly to geographic origin and taxonomic status. Analysis of allozyme variation in var 'lapponica', var 'armena' and var 'mongolica' demonstrated a high level of intrapopulational variability but a low level of interpopulational differentiation. It appears that the late Pleistocene blending of genetically diverse populations was responsible for the observed variation patterns. The constructed phylogenetic trees also showed late divergence of these three varieties. The var 'sylvestriformis' was genetically distinct from the other three P. sylvestris varieties. The genetic distances separating var 'sylvestriformis' from P. densiflora and the other taxa lend support to a separate taxonomic status for var 'sylvestriformis' and a close relation with P. densiflora. We found that var 'sylvestriformis' harbors admixtures of allozymes and cpDNA. from both P. sylvestris and P. densiflora, which suggests an introgressive nature of this variety. Levels of intrapopulational variability were similar in P. sylvestris and P. densiflora, but interpopulational differentiation was much higher in P. densiflora. In the constructed phylogenetic trees, populations of this species were characterized by relatively long internode distances and branch lengths.

Genotypes for individual allozyme and RAPD loci were inferred from segregation pattern's in haploid macrogametophytes. Therefore, it was possible to distinguish between homo- and heterozygotes carrying a RAPD fragment and to estimate directly the frequencies of RAPD fragments. The percentage of polymorphic loci and the expected and observed heterozygosity were lower for allozymes than for RAPDs. Average fixation indices for both types of markers were negative indicating a heterozygote excess over panmictic expectations. The apportionment of genetic variation within and among the investigated populations was similar for allozymes and RAPDs and showed that most of the variation resided within populations. RAPD genotypes inferred from haploid material were subsequently converted to diploid phenotypes and used to estimate indirectly the frequencies of RAPD fragments. Gene diversity measurements derived from indirectly estimated RAPD frequencies were distinctly lower than those based on directly estimated RAPD frequencies. This result was caused by the absence of the null homozygote at many loci which appeared as monomorphic in the diploid data set. Population differentiation coefficients based on the indirectly estimated RAPD frequencies were not concordant with those based on directly estimated RAPD frequencies. Our present results indicate that when complete genotype information can be obtained, RAPD analysis provides genetic information similar to that revealed by analysis of allozyme variation.

Based on data from 10 enzymatic loci, studied by starch gel electrophoresis, the following genetic parameters were characterized: mean number of alleles and genotypes per locus, heterozygosity and genotype polymorphism index, genetic diversity among sites and genetic similarity according to Nei and Roychoudhury. Most of the parameters differed both between sites as well as between pairs of populations.

Populations from the site polluted by heavy metals demonstrate higher genetic diversity then those from the control. Genetic similarities showed differentiation of particular populations from both locations in response to industrial pollution. These results provide evidence that the general pattern of adaptation strategy of populations to pollution stress is connected with increasing genetic variation. The best isoenzymatic markers for monitoring changes in the genetic structure of Scots pine populations under the influence of industrial pollution are fluorescent esterase (FEST), glutamic-oxaloacetatic transaminase (GOT-A and GOT-B), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH-A) and shikimate dehydrogenase (ShDH-A) loci."

Heritabilities (standard deviations) were 0.67 (0.16) and 0.33 (0.17) for the timing of bud set of 1-year-old seedlings and for frost hardiness 0.36 (0.14) and 0.20 (0.13) (not significantly different from zero) in the northern and southern populations, respectively.

The simulation model was based on monitoring 10 populations of 100 individuals. Five independent loci with two alleles were used to model the phenotypic trait of growth period. The results showed that genetic change will be slow and lag behind the moving optimum. Part of the slowness was due to the survival of current trees, which makes establishment of new trees with more suitable genotypes slower. Adaptation in species with fragmented populations and little migration could be even slower. Artificial regeneration with suitable seed sources can increase the proportion of adapted genotypes in cultivated species."

At six years from seeds, there was statistically significant variation for height, branch length to height ratio and needle length. On individual test sites, values of individual-tree heritability for height ranged from 0.20 to 0.35, whereas values of heritability for family means ranged from 0.41 to 0.59. These low to moderate heritabilities suggest that a combination of family and within-family selection would be effective in improving height growth for this population on individual sites. Across sites, values, of individual-tree. heritability for height ranged from 0.03 to 0.06, whereas values for heritability of family means ranged from 0.17 to 0.29.

Heterogeneity of the genetic variance among test sites contributed 1% to 13% of the GE interaction.

Eighteen full-sib families of P. sylvestris with parental origins between latitudes 62 and 67degrees N in Sweden were assessed for autumn cold acclimation (frost injury measured from artificial freeze testing) and growth rhythm during the first two growing seasons. One family north x south with 108 individuals was used for the construction of one linkage map for the male and one for the female parent using 286 markers from random amplification of polymorphic DNA. Marker trait associations (QTLs) for shoot elongation, growth cessation and cold acclimation were found on both maps. Some QTLs were verified in two additional north x south families. Proportions of the additive genetic variance explained by the markers (R- G(2)) indicated that genetic factors of large effect were involved in all investigated traits. Single or multiple markers accounted for between 16 and 47% of the additive variance in annual shoot elongation, between 42 and 79% of the additive variance in growth termination, and between 7 and 31% of the additive variation in autumn cold acclimation. The study confirms that there are major QTL regions on different linkage groups controlling a large part of the variation for growth rhythm and autumn cold acclimation in P. sylvestris."

The functions predict 13 year height from climate: degree-days > 5 degreesC; mean annual temperature; degree-days < 0 degreesC; summer-winter temperature differential; and a moisture index, the ratio of degree-days > 5 degreesC to mean annual precipitation. Validation of the response functions with two sets of independent data produced for all functions statistically significant simple correlations with coefficients as high as 0.81 between actual and predicted heights. The response functions described the widely different growth potentials typical of natural populations and demonstrated that these growth potentials have different climatic optima. Populations nonetheless tend to inhabit climates colder than their optima, with the disparity between the optimal and inhabited climates becoming greater as the climate becomes more severe. When driven by a global warming scenario of the Hadley Center, the functions described short-term physiologic and long-term evolutionary effects that were geographically complex. The short-term effects should be negative in the warmest climates but strongly positive in the coldest. Long- term effects eventually should ameliorate the negative short- term impacts, enhance the positive, and in time, substantially increase productivity throughout most of the contemporary pine forests of Eurasia. Realizing the long-term gains will require redistribution of genotypes across the landscape, a process that should take up to 13 generations and therefore many years."

Eight tree- ring density and width parameters for 16 different provenances were measured with densitometric techniques. The tree-ring data were recorded from 1982 to 1996. Correlation analysis calculated by raw series showed that tree-ring width decreases and percentage of latewood increases with an increase in the latitude of the seed source. High variability was found for raw tree-ring characteristics from tree to tree within each provenance for an observed period (individual variability). The age trend of each tree is well described by the chosen fitting curve, and is similar for the mean series of each provenance. As a consequence of these findings, the indexed chronology for each provenance mainly shows climatic signals. The SD of the indexed chronology (chronological variability) is low for each provenance, showing low sensitivity to climatic influences.  cluster analysis of provenances represented by tree-ring characteristics differentiated the provenances into three groups. However, the statistical distance between the groups was minor. So we can confirm that Scots pine provenances are highly adaptable to local ecological conditions and regional climatic influences."

Two samples with superior growth were contrasted with two weakly growing samples. Based on a sample size of 100 trees per provenance, genotypes were monitored at 16 enzyme coding gene loci. Effects between genetic and growth traits were studied by means of two-factorial analysis of variance and linear regression models with respect to diameter classes and subsets of elite and non-elite trees within provenance samples as well as diameter subsets of pooled provenance samples. Significant deviations are evident among the genetic structures of the four provenance samples. In each sample, deviations from Hardy- Weinberg structures are indicated at single loci. Inbreeding does not primarily account for such deviations. The study of diameter classes reveals that an increase of stem volume tends to coincide with an increase of the observed heterozygosities in three out of four provenance samples. In the case of two- locus genotypes at 6-PGDH and MDH-C, significant effects of heterozygosity on diameter growth are observed. By focusing the two most frequent alleles at six differentiation effective gene loci, significant relations to diameter growth can be particularly verified for two locus combinations including AAT- A. The genetic comparison of the elite and non-elite trees, the first subset reveals larger values for diversities, differentiation and heterozygosities than the second does. The genetic comparison between the subset of the 50 thinnest and the 50 thickest trees among the 400 individuals indicates higher values for the genetic multiplicity and the gene pool and multilocus diversity for the subsets with superior growth. It is concluded for the present that isoenzyme gene markers reveal an indicative potential for quantitative traits."

Multitrait, restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation was used in a full-sib Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) progeny trial in northern Sweden to utilize all available information regarding survival and growth on the individual tree level and to avoid bias due to selection caused by mortality. The trial was evaluated at the ages of 6, 11 15 and 27 yrs, including estimation of age-age genetic correlations, which were high.

The genetic correlation estimates between survival and height were all positive and varied between 0.03 and 0.65. Univariate estimation, considering only growth and ignoring survival, resulted in much higher heritabilities of tree height. This should be an effect due to the mortality and thus a bias caused by selection."

Wind- pollinated progenies, factorial and incomplete diallel mating designs were used to compare two natural populations of Scots pine (Haguenau, France, and Taborz, Poland) and their hybrids (Haguenau x Taborz). Families from Taborz were significantly (P < 0.001) less susceptible to twist rust than those from Haguenau. Inter-population hybrids were as susceptible as the Haguenau population. No clear relationship between severity of infection, shoot length and phenological stage at time of inoculation was observed in intra- and interpopulation crosses. Differences observed between the two natural populations for their response to twist rust are suggested to be the consequence of local adaptation simultaneously for climatic conditions and pathogen pressure. Within each of the two populations, the effects of general combining abilities (GCA) for rust susceptibility were predominant, although estimation of individual heritabilities remained at a moderate level (0.30-0.54). In interpopulation crosses, GCA effects of Haguenau and Taborz populations were still predominant. Moreover, hybrid performance could be predicted with confidence based on the intrapopulation GCA values of parents. Genetic gain on twist rust resistance could be achieved quickly through intrapopulation mass or backward selection based on wind- pollinated progeny tests."

A synthetic volume estimate (based on height, diameter and survival) was evaluated for phenotypic stability. On the basis of growth performance in various environments the range of Scots pine in the former USSr is divided into 10 regions (A- to J) and these divisions are compared with earlier attempts at subdividing this vast area. There is agreement in the opinions about productivity of the populations. It is high in populations from the south-west and from the East European plain, poor from the north, south and far east and medium from central latitudes in Asia. When based on other features the proposed subdivisions give a different picture. In stem straightness a distinct geographic differentiation is observed, however it is unrelated to growth performance and only slightly correlated with survival, thus for this trait a different split up the range is proposed into four regions (I to IV). This split up of the range does not resemble in any way any of the previous divisions."

An inconsistency in species diagnostic cpDNA haplotypes of seedlings and parental trees was observable both for P. uliginosa and P. sylvestris (about 1% and 2% of hybrids seeds, respectively).

Twelve provenances were chosen throughout the species' range in Bulgaria. Following DNA extraction, chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) loci were surveyed using six primer pairs. Between 4 to 8 size variants were identified at each locus. A total of 35 size variants at the six loci were identified, 11 occurring at low frequencies (< 1%). They were combined in 134 different haplotypes, of which seven represent 1/3 of the genetic structure. AMOVA analysis revealed that 10.99% of the variation was found among populations, while 89.01% was expressed within populations. The cpSSR analysis divided Scots pine populations into two groups, the first represented by populations located in the south-western part of the Rhodopes and Pirin mountains, while the second group is located in the northeast of Rhodopes and Rila mountains. Terpene analysis revealed that on average, 53% of the monoterpene pool in P. sylvestris was accounted for by a-pinene (range 47-59%) followed by (beta-pinene (range 6-12%). The presence of two distinct groups is weekly consistent with physical distances between populations, similar significant correlation between genetic distance determined by chloroplast microsatellites analysis and chemotype distance (determined by terpenes) was observed.

Location The study focuses on Scots pine populations in the northern Meseta and peripheral mountain chains, central and north-western Iberian Peninsula. The ample macrofossil record in the area shows that this 60,000-km(2) region represent a glacial refugium for Scots pine. The species occupied large areas on the Meseta plains during glacial cold stages, but it has periodically sheltered at high elevation in the surrounding mountain chains during warm episodes, conforming to a fragmented pattern similar to its present-day distribution. Methods We perform a fine-scale chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) survey to assess the genetic structure of 13 montane Scots pine isolates in the northern Meseta (total N = 322 individuals). Using a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), we test the hypothesis of genetic isolation among disjunct mountain areas. We use a standard coalescence model to estimate genealogical relationship among populations, investigating the potential role of the regional relief as a factor influencing historic gene exchange among Scots pine populations. Results Population haplotypic diversity was high among Scots pine populations (H-e = 0.978), greater than values reported for other more thermophilic pine species in the Iberian Peninsula. The AMOVA revealed low (but significant) differentiation among populations (Phi(ST) = 0.031, P = 0.010), showed that the disjoint montane distribution could not account for the genetic divergence among areas (Phi(CT) = 0.012, P = 0.253), and that there was non-trivial subdivision among populations within the same mountain region (Phi(SC) = 0.021, P = 0.012). The genealogical relationships among populations showed that Scots pine isolates growing on disjoint mountain blocks, but on slopes flowing to the same basin, were genetically closer than populations growing on different slopes of the same mountain chain, flowing to different basins. Main conclusions The observed genetic structure for Scots pine is consistent with its population history, inferred from the palaeobotanical record, with vertical migrations throughout climatic pulses and with the drainage basins and large long-term population sizes connecting different mountain blocks during the cooler glacial periods. Overall, the results suggest that, despite periodic interstadial fragmentation episodes, Scots pine biology provides for the long-term maintenance of high within-population and low among-population genetic diversity at neutral genetic markers."

Unfortunately, the between-family variances differed substantially between populations that resulted in a bimodal posterior of Q(ST) that could not be compared in any sensible way with the unimodal posterior of the microsatellite F-ST. In order to avoid publishing studies with flawed Q(ST) estimates, we recommend that future studies should present heritability estimates for each trait and population.

Two different estimation strategies have emerged: ( a) an indirect approach, using the 'genetic structure' of the pollen received by different mothers and (b) a direct approach, based on parentage analysis. The indirect strategy is somewhat limited by the assumptions, but is widely useful. The direct approach is most appropriate where a large majority of the true fathers can be identified exactly, which is sometimes possible with high-resolution SSR markers. Using the parentage approach, we develop estimates of PPI, showing that the obvious estimates are severely biased, and providing an unbiased alternative. We then illustrate the methods with SSR data from a 36-tree isolated population of Pinus sylvestris from the Meseta region of Spain, for which categorical paternity assignment was available for over 95% of offspring.

The analysis of the polymorphisms in the nad 1 intron sequence confirmed that the Italian P. sylvestris populations have the same mitotype (mitotype a) as the Central European ones. In the genomic ISSR analysis the proportion of shared alleles between the individuals showed the highest degree of differentiation between French and Italian populations and a divergence between the Alpine and Apennine populations.

In addition, the individuals from the Apennines did not show a clear population structure, suggesting a common genetic constitution of Apennine P. sylvestris. It is likely that this constitution is the result of a progressive genetic isolation between the Alpine and the Northern Apennine populations from the early Holocene. The genetic constitution of the Northern Apennine populations suggests the opportunity of a management where in situ conservation of such small populations could be coupled to their use as sources of suitable local reforesting materials."

However, due to the absence of precise methods for identification of hybrid seeds and hybrid trees, the frequency of hybridisation and its influence on the genetic structure of relict P. mugo populations has not been clarified so far. In the present study, the species-specific chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) marker and isozymes were applied to test the hybridisation hypothesis in a postulated hybrid swarm population of the species from "Bor na Czerwonem" reserve at the northern foothills of Tatra Mts., Poland. The cpDNA marker was used to identify hybrids within two groups of polycormic (multi-stemmed) and monocormic (single-stemmed) pines from this population. Allelic frequencies at isozyme loci from both groups were compared to frequencies found in allopatric populations of the species. Additionally, cpDNA haplotypes of seedlings derived from open pollinated seeds were studied to detect the possibility of successful cross-pollination. The mixture of seedlings with P. sylvestris and P. mugo cpDNA haplotypes was derived from one parental tree that indicates hybridisation. However, all the mature polycormic pines had cpDNA haplotypes species specific to P. mugo and the isozyme frequencies were similar to frequencies found in three allopatric populations of P. mugo from Tatra Mts. (mean genetic distance, Dn =.027). The differences were much larger in comparisons with monocormic pines from this area (Dn =.085) and two P. syluestris samples from distant allopatric populations (Dn =.077). Nearly all monocormic pines had cpDNA species specific to P. sylvestris and isozyme frequencies similar to other populations of this species (mean Dn =.004). Only one P. sylvestris-like monocormic tree had cpDNA of P. mugo and can be considered as a hybrid. The results do not provide evidence supporting the hybrid swarm hypothesis. Rather, the results suggest that mature hybrids have a low frequency within this population and (rare) hybridisation is not reciprocal but unidirectional with P. mugo as pollen donor."

The average proportion of polymorphic loci for populations ranged from 58.8% to 70.6%. The average number of alleles per locus per population was 2.65. The mean estimated expected heterozygosity (He) of populations was 0.294.

The mean value of Nei's genetic distance is similar to the values reported for other European Scots pine populations.

Deciphering the molecular basis of electrophoretic variation is essential for understanding the forces affecting the protein level variation. In this study, the relationship between allozyme heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity in plants is investigated among and within species. Allozyme and nucleotide diversity in 27 plant species was reviewed. At the multilocus level, the two methods are congruent: a clear correlation between the two measures of genetic diversity among plant species was observed, strengthening the view that effective population size is the major determinant of genome-wide diversity. Nucleotide diversity at six allozyme coding genes (6pgdB, aco, gdh, gotC, mdhA, and mdhB) in conifer Pinus sylvestris was investigated jointly with electrophoretic data. Single non-synonymous charge-changing mutations were found together with electrophoretic alleles that consequently were mutationally unique. Synonymous site nucleotide diversity (point estimate of theta (W)-0.009 per bp) and silent site divergence from Pinus pinaster at allozyme coding loci were at comparable levels with other loci in the species. Linkage disequilibrium was extensive compared to earlier estimates from P. sylvestris and other trees, spanning several kilobases. Allozyme coding genes had an excess of closely related haplotypes whose frequency has recently increased possibly as a result of partial selective sweeps or balancing selection, but complex demographic effects cannot be excluded."

In Scotland, 84 native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) woodlands are recognised by the Forestry Commission and they occupy highly diverse environments from the maritime west coast to continental sites in eastern Scotland. However, it is not known whether adaptations to local environments along sharp temperature and rainfall gradients have occurred in different populations and as a result, the seed transfer guidelines of the species are based only on data from isozymes and monoterpenes. In this study of an outdoor common-garden trial, we used chlorophyll fluorescence to examine whether seedlings from 32 open-pollinated families and eight populations from sites experiencing contrasting annual temperature regimes differed in their response to variation in natural outdoor temperatures between September 2009 and May 2010. In addition, growth initiation in spring was recorded. Photochemical capacity at photosystem II F(v)/F(m) showed a distinct seasonal trend and remained at relatively high levels (similar to 0.7) until November. Following a period of over 2 weeks with temperatures below or close to 0 degrees C, F(v)/F(m) started decreasing towards its minimum values recorded in early March when population means varied between 0.35 and 0.45. By early May and along with rising temperatures, photochemical capacity had recovered to the same level as observed in early November. Populations were found to respond differently to the cold period starting in December. The largest drop in photochemical capacity was observed in seedlings from a low-altitude population located in the maritime western Scotland, while in seedlings from higher-altitude locations in the cooler eastern Scotland, the response was smaller. In March, the recovery of photochemical capacity was slowest in seedlings from the mildest and coolest sites. Evidence of adaptive genetic differentiation was also found in spring phenology. Initiation of shoot elongation and needle flush were earlier in families from higher altitudes (cooler areas), but population differences were not significant at the alpha = 0.05 level. These results suggest that adaptation to the spatially heterogeneous environment in Scotland has taken place in Scots pine and that in order to minimise the risk of planting maladapted seed stock, the patterns of environmental and adaptive genetic variation should be taken into account in the management of genetic resources in this species."

We set out to investigate three specific speciation scenarios: (I) P. uliginosa is a homoploid hybrid between the other two, (II) the species have evolved without gene flow after divergence and (III) there has been substantial gene flow between the species since their divergence. Overall, the genetic data suggest that P. mugo and P. uliginosa share the same gene pool (average net divergence of 0.0001) and that the phenotypic differences (e.g. growth form) are most likely due to very limited areas of the genome. P. mugo and P. uliginosa are more diverged from P. sylvestris than from each other (average net divergence of 0.0027 and 0.0026, respectively). The nucleotide patterns can best be explained by the divergence with migration speciation scenario, although the hybrid speciation scenario with small genomic contribution from P. sylvestris cannot be completely ruled out. We suggest that the large amount of shared polymorphisms between the pine taxa and the lack of monophyly at all loci studied between P. sylvestris and P. mugo-P. uliginosa can largely be explained by relatively recent speciation history and large effective population sizes but also by interspecific gene flow. These closely related pine taxa form an excellent system for searching for loci involved in adaptive variation as they are differentiated in phenotype and ecology but have very similar genetic background."

Genetic diversity is not only a product of the number of species present in a given area, but also of successional change from colonization of gaps by pioneer species to mature climax forest. Genetic diversity should be higher in earlier successional stages than in later stages because high environmental predictability in later successional stages favours low genetic diversity. In the present study the relationship between secondary succession and genetic diversity was explored in eight stands of characteristic tree communities in the Thuringian forest area (Germany). Each of the eight stands was subdivided into six plots in a grid of 40 x 40 m to detect as much as possible tree species and genetic variants within the forest tree community and succession-specific structures. To define secondary succession, the mean Ellenberg indicator values for light and nitrogen in the herb layer, weighted for coverage, as well as the percentage of climax tree species in naturally regenerated stands were used. All species and genotype diversities based on the investigated tree species were calculated by the so-called Hill numbers. The results showed that the Gregorius's Covariation (C) of secondary succession with the transspecific genotype diversity as well as the transspecific genotype diversity per species for the enzyme systems AAT, HEK, PGI, MDH, IDH as well as the AFLP trait was statistically significant in several relationships. The transspecific genotype diversities were often significantly greater in the earlier successional stages than in the later stages. Selection effects during replacement of light and nitrogen demanding species and plant communities by more economical and competitive species such as Abies alba Mill. and Fagus sylvatica L. probably dominated in the study. Based on the results of the study, we conclude that genetic diversity may be an essential attribute of stages of secondary succession that should be further explored because of its relation to adaptability and ecological stability."

In plants, where both seed and pollen disperse, three components of exotic gene flow with potentially unequal consequences should be, but have not been, explicitly distinguished: zygotic, male gametic and female gametic. Building on a previous model for estimating contemporary rates of zygotic and male gametic gene flow among plant populations, we present here an approach that additionally estimates the third (female gametic) gene flow component, based on a combination of uni- and biparentally inherited markers. Using this method and a combined set of chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites, we estimate gene flow rates from exotic plantations into two Iberian relict stands of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Results show neither zygotic nor female gametic gene flow but moderate (6-8%) male gametic introgression for both species, implying significant dispersal of pollen, but not of seeds, from exotic plantations into native stands shortly after introduced trees reached reproductive maturity. Numerical simulation results suggest that the model yields reasonably accurate estimates for our empirical data sets, especially for larger samples. We discuss conservation management implications of observed levels of exposure to nonlocal genes and identify research needs to determine potentially associated hazards. Our approach should be useful for plant ecologists and ecosystem managers interested in the vectors of contemporary genetic connectivity among discrete plant populations."

This corresponds more to the hypothesis that the modern area of Pinus sylvestris originated via settlement from many origins than to the hypothesized single center of the post-glacial recolonization. The distribution of the pairwise differences between the individual specimens corresponded to the model of sudden population growth. The assessments of the age of this event for Pinus sylvestris (4.5-4.7 million years), which were obtained on the basis of this model, significantly exceeded the age of the Quaternary.

A total of 196 evenly spaced trees were sampled from a naturally regenerated and two managed-regeneration stands (plantation and seed-tree), in each of three different regions in Sweden (Arjeplog, Vihelmina, and Hammerdal). Population parameters were estimated for microsatellite loci from the nuclear and chloroplast genomes (5 and 11 loci, respectively) and a single mitochondrial locus (nad7). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows no significant effects of stand management on the level of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic diversity or inbreeding (p<0.05). Duncan post-hoc analysis suggested significantly lower values for the chloroplast number of effective alleles (N-ea_CP) and total gene diversity (H-t_CP) for natural and plantation practices, as compared with seed-tree regeneration. The ANOVA supported a rather weak effect of the management factor (M) on N-ea_CP and H-t_CP, with p values of 0.08 and 0.07, respectively. Inbreeding coefficient (F-5) indicated a deviation from random mating in all stands caused by an excess of homozygotes. All the stands are composed of a mixture of half-and full-sibs, but no pattern of spatial relatedness was detected in any of them. Our data suggest that genetic diversity is similar in both natural stands and those with managed regeneration, probably because regeneration practices did not decrease the population size to a point where random drift effects might be important. The estimates for the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) genomes should be regarded with caution, as only five nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci less affected by null alleles (<25 %) were analyzed. Our investigation indicates that the reduction to five nSSR loci does not change the main finding of an absence of differences in genetic diversity among stands, except for the number of rare alleles (RA), which is lower when estimated from data for eight nSSR loci."

Scots pine (Finns sylvestris L.) is the most widely distributed conifer in the world and main forest forming component in Europe. Based on genetic, morphological and growth performance traits, several local ecotypes of the species were distinguished across the species distribution range. The existence of local ecotypes differentiated at many adaptive and phenotypic traits provides unique opportunity for addressing the questions about the genetic basis of local adaptation across the species distribution range. However, information about the underlying population structure between ecotypes is needed for efficient studies of adaptive variation at molecular level. The presented study focused on the genetic variation analysis between nineteen populations of Scots pine from across geographical locations in Poland and eleven reference samples from Northern, Western and Southern Europe. The pattern of nucleotide polymorphisms at 673 polymorphic nucleotide sites found across twenty nine nuclear loci was studied to determine genetic relationship and population structure of different geographical locations. Genetic relationships between populations were conducted based on Baysian assignment and conventional frequency based statistics at the within and between population level. The results indicate very uniform genetic background of Polish populations of the species that despite high phenotypic and ecological differentiation most likely share the same recolonization history. High genetic similarity was found between Polish and North European range of the species. In contrast, differentiation was found in relation to the reference populations from Scotland and Spain that in previous studies were shown to deviate from simple recolonization model after last glaciations and had unique mtDNA mitotypes not observed in continental continuous range of the species, respectively. Considering high differentiation at quantitative traits between northern and central part of the species range in Europe but very homogenous genetic background found in the presented study, it seems that this part of Scots pine distribution is particularly suitable for association genetic studies to find genomic regions that are involved in species adaptive and phenotypic variation."

Ten individuals of admixed genetic composition were found in all three groups of samples; however, the majority of hybrids except one individual were identified across the samples classified as P. mugo and polycormic pines. Those trees that contained a mixture of nuclear gene haplotypes observed in the reference populations of pure species and cpDNA from P. mugo, most likely represent the first generation of hybrids. Analysis of the allelic frequency spectra and compound neutrality tests identified deviations from neutrality at several genes. This contact zone seems suitable for selection of a mapping population both in hybrid and parental species for admixture mapping to effectively search for polymorphisms that may play role in species adaptive variation and speciation."

Previous work based on common garden trials has demonstrated that native pine populations (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) exhibit differentiation in terms of growth, phenology and frost resistance. However, despite their important role in plant fitness, no such information is available on leaf traits, which have shown both plastic and adaptive genetic responses to environmental variation in other species. We analysed a subset of 11 needle characters in 192 saplings grown in a population-progeny common garden trial based on seedlots from eight native pinewoods. Narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) was estimated for each trait and found to be particularly high (1.30 +/- 0.33) for resin canal density. The majority of the phenotypic variation found was within populations, although interpopulation differentiation was detected for needle length (Delta AICc = 2.55). Resin canal density was positively correlated with longitude (beta = 0.45, Delta AICc = 4.23), whereas stomatal row density was negatively correlated (beta = -0.12, Delta AICc = 2.55). These trends may reflect adaptation for differences in moisture availability and altitude between eastern and western populations in Scotland."

Reference populations formed three distinct genetic clusters comprising Pinus sylvestris, Pinus mugo/Pinus uliginosa, and Pinus uncinata.

Based on phenotypic characteristics and molecular data, we identified five groups of individuals in the contact zone in Poland, comprising forms of the parental species and intermediates that were most probably the result of interspecific crosses. A combination of nuclear gene sequence data and a diagnostic organelle marker were used to show that hybridization is frequent in the contact zone and results in hybrid trees with distinct phenotypic identity. The influence of selection in maintaining hybrid phenotypes in environments unsuited to parental species was inferred from nucleotide polymorphism data. A lack of admixture in reference populations suggests that hybridization has not occurred during post-glacial migration and so the contact zone represents a distinct, active example of ongoing evolution. Pine populations in this zone will be a valuable system for studying the genetic basis of hybrid advantage in environmental conditions untypical of pure parental species."

In particular, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) has an exceptionally broad area of dispersal covering different climates and soil conditions, but the genetic variability in extreme conditions has not been studied. We hypothesized that the genetic variability of P. sylvestris is enhanced at its soil fertility limit in bogs where stunted trees form a sparse canopy with reduced light competition, but in highly turbulent conditions generating ideal conditions for distant pollen dispersal. A total of 180 individuals were studied from three bog populations using five nuclear (nSSR) and five chloroplastic (cpSSR) polymorphic microsatellite loci (simple sequence repeats, SSR). According to both marker systems, high and similar level of genetic diversity (ca. 99 % within the populations and 1 % among the populations) was observed for nuclear (F-ST = 0.007 and R-ST = 0.022) and chloroplast (F-ST = 0.015 and R-ST = 0.023) genomes. Despite the low genetic differentiation among the populations, there was evidence of geographic genetic differentiation in the chloroplast genomes, suggesting that isolation by distance might be a possible mechanism shaping the present distribution of genetic variability. In addition, significant but low spatial genetic structure along habitat wetness gradient was found in nuclear genomes in one site. Significant cyto-nuclear linkage disequilibrium was shown between one of the cpSSR loci to all nSSR loci. The results demonstrate a huge within-population genetic variability in these sites and underscore the importance of pollen gene flow in homogenizing populations on these geographic scales."

The degree to which forests respond to threats from pathogens depends on their adaptive capacity, which is determined largely by genetically controlled variation in susceptibility of the individual trees within them and the heritability and evolvability of this trait. The most significant current threat to the economically and ecologically important species Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is dothistroma needle blight (DNB), caused by the foliar pathogen Dothistroma septosporum. A progeny-population trial of 4-year-old Scots pine trees, comprising six populations from native Caledonian pinewoods each with three to five families in seven blocks, was artificially inoculated using a single isolate of D. septosporum. Susceptibility to D. septosporum, assessed as the percentage of non-green needles, was measured regularly over a period of 61 days following inoculation, during which plants were maintained in conditions ideal for DNB development (warm; high humidity; high leaf wetness). There were significant differences in susceptibility to D. septosporum among families indicating that variation in this trait is heritable, with high estimates of narrow-sense heritability (0.38-0.75) and evolvability (genetic coefficient of variation, 23.47). It is concluded that native Scots pine populations contain sufficient genetic diversity to evolve lower susceptibility to D. septosporum through natural selection in response to increased prevalence of this pathogen."

Modelling was based on empirical data of DNA polymorphism in (a) a 60-year-old natural stand and (b) a 20-year-old young stand planted with seeds collected in a seed orchard. Within each of these stands, approximately 400 trees were systematically sampled within 1-ha plots (800 trees in total) and genotyped at 5 neutral and 7 EST-derived nuclear microsatellite markers. There was no significant association between heterozygosity, common allele number and tree diameter in either stand. Even at a high intensity, both simulated tending and commercial thinning had minor effects on the heterozygosity and allelic diversity but caused a significant loss of rare alleles. However, there was a nonlinear relationship between the loss of rare alleles and the thinning intensity in the young stand, such that below 30 % thinning intensity, the rare alleles were lost at a markedly lower rate. In conclusion, the association between commercial value and genetic diversity is weak in Scots pine. Thinning causes loss of rare alleles; however, for specific cases, it could be possible to identify the margins for a slow rate of rare allele loss."

Studies on the chemical composition plus variability of its needles morphological structure allow for an assessment of the state of environmental pollution. However, in their natural populations, the response of individual trees to stress differs. This study reports on the influence of long-term soil contamination with trace elements on the morphology of the needles, its possible relation to the differentiation of the genetic pool, and their implications for biomonitoring. In the natural and self-renewable pine stand growing near the point polluter (zinc smelter, Upper Silesia, Poland), two categories of trees are observed with respect to their health status: pollution-tolerant (T) and pollution-sensitive (S). A detailed analysis of the trace element content of the needles reveals that the concentration of Cd, Zn, Pb, and Cu in the needles is significantly higher in S as compared to T individuals. The metal accumulation pattern decidedly follows the sequence Pb > Cd > Cu > Zn. An analysis of the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of the needles reveals that sensitive trees showed an FA index ten times higher in comparison to tolerant ones. Moreover, the high differences between these S and T tree groups are also observed in the basic genetic diversity parameters investigated by an analysis of DNA simple sequence repeats (SSR). The concentration of trace elements in pine needles, distinct in sensitive and tolerant trees and in connection with their morphological and genetic characteristics, may reflect an adaptation process. The level of Mg and Fe content in the needles could be a physiological-toxicological index for evaluating trace element "lethality" expressed as Mg and Fe mineral-survival strategies. The example of differences described in this Scots pine population should be taken into consideration in ecotoxicological research to better interpret the obtained results."

Nowadays, next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods allow identifying thousands of SSRs in one sequencing run, which greatly facilitates isolation and development of new SSRs. However, their usefulness as molecular markers still must be tested empirically on a number of populations to select SSRs with best parameters for future population genetic research. An alternative approach, cheaper and faster than isolation and characterization of new SSRs, involves cross-amplification of SSRs in closely related species. Aims: Our goal was to develop multiplex PCR protocols that will be useful in population genetic studies of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and dwarf mountain pine (P. mugo Turra), and possibly other pine species. Methods: We tested 14 chloroplast (cpSSRs) and 22 nuclear (nSSRs) microsatellite markers originally designed for Japanese black pine (P. thunbergii Parl.), P. sylvestris and loblolly pine (P. taeda L.) in four populations of P. sylvestris and P. mugo across different locations in Europe. We designed six multiplex PCRs, which were subsequently screened for their ability to provide repeatable and high quality amplification products using capillary electrophoresis. Results: The transfer rate in our study was similar in both pine species, and it was very high for cpSSRs (93% and 86% for P. sylvestris and P. mugo, respectively) and moderate for nSSRs (59% for both species). We managed to design five well-performing multiplex reactions out of six initially tested. Most of the tested loci were polymorphic. Moreover, the allelic patterns detected at some cpSSRs were species-specific. Conclusions: We provide a set of five multiplexes which can be used in genetic studies of both P. sylvestris and P. mugo.

In small and isolated populations, elevated inbreeding levels might reduce fitness of subsequent generations and threaten forest resilience in the long term. Comparing fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) between life stages (e.g. adult and juvenile cohorts) can identify when populations have undergone disturbance, even in species with long generation times. Here, we studied the effects of historical and contemporary forest management, characterized by intense felling and natural regeneration respectively, on genetic diversity and fine-scale SGS in adult and juvenile cohorts. We examined fragmented Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in the Scottish Highlands, and compared them with a remote, unmanaged stand. A total of 777 trees were genotyped using 12 nuclear microsatellite markers. No difference was identified in allelic richness or gene diversity among stands or life stages, suggesting that historical and contemporary management have not impacted levels of genetic variation. However, management appears to have changed the spatial distribution of genetic variation. Adult genotypes from managed stands were more spatially structured than in the unmanaged stand, a difference mediated by contrasts in tree density, degree of fragmentation of stands at the time of establishment and rate of gap creation. Surprisingly, juveniles were less spatially structured than adults in the managed stands, suggesting an historical erosion of the structure of the adult cohort but contemporary recovery to natural dynamics, and indicating a high capacity of the species to recover after disturbance. Here we showed that using the spatial component of genetic diversity can help to detect both historical and contemporary effects of disturbance in tree populations. Evaluation of successional change is important to adequately detect early responses of tree populations to forest management practices. Overall, our study suggests that combining sustainable management with forest conservation practices that ensure larger effective population sizes is key to successfully maintaining genetic diversity in Scots pine."

Adaptive phenotypic traits are genetically differentiated along environmental gradients, but the genetic basis of such adaptation is still poorly known. Genetic association studies of local adaptation combine data over populations. Correcting for population structure in these studies can be problematic since both selection and neutral demographic events can create similar allele frequency differences between populations. Correcting for demography with traditional methods may lead to eliminating some true associations. We developed a new Bayesian approach for identifying the loci underlying an adaptive trait in a multipopulation situation in the presence of possible double confounding due to population stratification and adaptation. With this method we studied the genetic basis of timing of bud set, a surrogate trait for timing of yearly growth cessation that confers local adaptation to the populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Population means of timing of bud set were highly correlated with latitude. Most effects at individual loci were small. Interestingly, we found genetic heterogeneity (that is, different sets of loci associated with the trait) between the northern and central European parts of the cline. We also found indications of stronger stabilizing selection toward the northern part of the range. The harsh northern conditions may impose greater selective pressure on timing of growth cessation, and the relative importance of different environmental cues used for tracking the seasons might differ depending on latitude of origin."

In this study, we examined genetic relationships, genetic divergence and demographic history of peripheral populations from central-eastern Europe, the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Basin. Four hundred twenty-one individuals from 20 populations were sampled and characterized with both nuclear and chloroplast simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Standard population genetic indices, the degree of genetic differentiation and spatial genetic structure were analysed. Our results revealed that peripheral Scots pine populations retained high genetic diversity despite the recently ongoing fragmentation and isolation of the persisting relict populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed 7% among-population genetic differentiation, and there was no isolation by distance among the island-like occurrences. Genetic discontinuities with strong barriers (99-100% bootstrap support) were identified in the Carpathians. Based on both marker types, populations of the Western Carpathians were delimited from those inhabiting the Eastern Carpathians, and two main genetic lineages were traced that most probably originate from two main refugia. One refugium presumably existed in the region of the Eastern Alps with the Hungarian Plain, while the other was probably found in the Eastern Carpathians. These findings are supported by recent palynological records. The strongest genetic structure was revealed within the Romanian Carpathians on the basis of both marker types. With only some exceptions, no signs of recent bottlenecks or inbreeding were detected. However, Carpathian natural populations of Scots pine are highly fragmented and have a small census size, though they have not yet been affected by genetic erosion induced by isolation."

Material and methods: We used Iberian pines as an example to undertook gene pool characterization based on a wide Iberian sample of 97 populations from five Pinus species (Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinaster, Pinus nigra, Pinus sylvestris and Pinus uncinata). Haplotypes from each analyzed tree (derived from nine chloroplast microsatellites markers in P. halepensis and six in the rest of the species) were obtained. Based on this information we subdivided each species in regions (considering both genetic structure and its application in afforestation, restoration and conservation programs) and tested the assignation of populations to the different groups based on the genetic distance among samples. Main results: The rate of successful identification of populations among the different species was very high (> 94 %) for P. nigra, P. sylvestris and P. uncinata, high (81 %) for P. pinaster, and low (< 65 %) for P. halepensis. Research highlights: Chloroplast DNA markers from extensive population datasets can be used to assign the origin of the forest reproductive material in some pine species."

The phenotypic differentiation of the populations was compared to diversity estimates at a set of ten nuclear microsatellite markers. Scots pine populations were highly differentiated concerning diameter at breast high, stand volume, stem straightness and crown width according to the provenance and climatic zones. At the same time a low genetic diversity for microsatellite markers and no evidence of population structure was found among proveniences. Local populations from the Carpathian Mountains had lower genetic variation and weaker growth compared to lowland provenances. Among the tested populations Scots pine from lowlands were characterized by the great growth potential and good adaptation to the severe climate of the Carpathians.

Effective pollen-mediated gene flow among plant populations requires synchrony of flowering. Therefore differences in timing of flowering among genetically divergent populations may reduce their ability to adapt to environmental change. To determine whether gene flow among differently adapted populations of native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Scotland was restricted by differences in their flowering phenology, we measured timing of pollen release among populations spanning a steep environmental gradient over three consecutive seasons (2014-2016). Results showed that, over a distance of 137km, there were as many as 15.8days' difference among populations for the predicted timing of peak pollen shedding, with the earliest development in the warmer west of the country. There was much variation between years, with the earliest development and least synchrony in the warmest year (2014) and latest development and greatest synchrony in the coolest year (2015). Timing was negatively correlated with results from a common-garden experiment, indicative of a pattern of countergradient variation. We conclude that the observed differences in reproductive synchrony were sufficient to limit gene flow via pollen between populations of P.sylvestris at opposite ends of the environmental gradient across Scotland. We also hypothesize that continually warming, or asymmetrically warming spring temperatures will decrease reproductive synchrony among pine populations."

Since the Tertiary, it has persisted also in the Mediterranean region, forming relict populations. In this study, we investigate range-wide genetic diversity of Scots pine, aiming to provide comprehensive information on the phylogeography and genetic resources of the species. LocationEurope and Asia. Methods Thirteen paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) loci were used to investigate the genetic structure of 62 populations from Fennoscandia and 30 populations from the Mediterranean. We also surveyed variability of two maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) regions and additionally included literature data from 156 populations (248 populations in total). ResultsScots pine retains an overall high genetic diversity in the chloroplast genome but, unexpectedly, the historically younger populations from Fennoscandia showed statistically higher mean intrapopulation diversity than the Mediterranean stands (0.807 and 0.750, respectively). The latter also contained a lower number of private cpSSR haplotypes. Population differentiation with respect to mtDNA was higher (G(ST)=0.628) than at cpSSR (G(ST)=0.015) indicating an efficient pollen-mediated gene flow among refugial populations of the species. One novel haplotype mtDNA was found, increasing the number of known mitotypes for the species from 4 to 5. The geographic distribution of mitotypes was structured into four groups corresponding to the main refugial areas of the species. Main conclusions Genetic impoverishment of the Mediterranean populations may enhance their vulnerability to future environmental changes. The spatial distribution of two mitotypes in Fennoscandia, featuring predominance of mitotype a in Norway and Sweden and mitotype b in Finland, gives strong support for dual colonization of that region from south-eastern (Finland) and south-western (Sweden) directions. These results thus provide new insights into both Holocene expansion of Scots pine and the present distribution of species' genetic resources."

In particular, the postglacial recolonization of these areas and possible different adaptation patterns in distinct refugia were studied. The GS and diversity were assessed with seven pairs of neutral nuclear microsatellite primers. A high genetic diversity was found in the Scots pine material tested, along with a shallow GS. This pattern is typical for recolonized areas and species with large population sizes, which are connected by pollen-mediated gene flow. A STRUCTURE analysis found two genetic groups to be the most likely, one south-eastern and one north-western group that meet in Fennoscandia. This indicates that Scots pine recolonization of Fennoscandia might have taken place from two different directions (south-west and north-east). Scots pine that recolonized the area originated in at least two different refugia during the last glacial maximum. The glacial survival in distinct refugia can have led to different adaptation patterns and growth optima in the different groups as reflected in the formation of latewood content, where lineage was a significant influencing factor."

Observations made under common environmental conditions may reveal phenotypic differences between populations with an underlying genetic basis; however, exposure to a contrasting novel environment can trigger release of otherwise unobservable (cryptic) genetic variation. We conducted a waterlogging experiment on a common garden trial of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris (L.), saplings originating from across a steep rainfall gradient in Scotland. A flood treatment was maintained for approximately 1year; physiological responses were gauged periodically in terms of photochemical capacity as measured via chlorophyll fluorescence. During the treatment, flooded individuals experienced a reduction in photochemical capacity, F-v/F-m, this reduction being greater for material originating from drier, eastern sites. Phenotypic variance was increased under flooding, and this increase was notably smaller in saplings originating from western sites where precipitation is substantially greater and waterlogging is more common. We conclude that local adaptation has occurred with respect to waterlogging tolerance and that, under the flooding treatment, the greater increase in variability observed in populations originating from drier sites is likely to reflect a relative absence of past selection. In view of a changing climate, we note that comparatively maladapted populations may possess considerable adaptive potential, due to cryptic genetic variation, that should not be overlooked."

The examined populations had short needles, which is characteristic for mountain habitats of the Scots pine. The populations from the Pieniny Mts. had fewer rows of stomata on both sides of the needles than others studied stands of Eurosiberian Scots pine. The number of stomata on both flat and convex sides of the needles was similar to the values observed for populations growing on the nearby Tatra Mountains.

Recent findings of pollen-release asynchronies in distant populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) within Scotland suggest that gene dispersal among more distant populations might be less effective than previously thought. Limited gene dispersal is one of the major factors causing genetic structure for neutral markers, and pollen-release asynchrony could have driven isolation by distance (IBD) among Scottish populations. Previous studies of neutral markers found little differentiation among Scottish populations of Scots pine, however they did not consider IBD over the full Scottish range. We analysed data from 6 nuclear simple sequence repeats (SSR) and 5 chloroplast SSR loci in a total of 540 individuals of Scots pine from 18 populations across Scotland. Our aim was to assess contemporary levels and distribution of genetic variation and to test if the distribution of genetic diversity was consistent with IBD. We also analysed patterns of gene flow that could have contributed to the observed patterns of variation. Levels of genetic diversity were high, for both nuclear and chloroplast markers within populations, and there was no significant differentiation among populations. A weak signal of IBD was present. We found an increase in nuclear diversity towards the East along with greater gene flow in a West-East direction commensurate with the prevailing winds. Our findings suggest that this wind-driven gene flow is dominant over genetic drift and prevents differentiation among the Scottish populations. It may also counteract any pollen-release asynchronies among populations."

The object of this study is to characterize the genetic variation within and between 6 yew stands using isozyme and cpDNA (PCR-RFLPs and cpSSRs) markers. This study should enlarge the basis for the conservation measures of genetic resources of yew. Genotyping of individual trees has been carried out by analysis of bud material. For isozyme analysis, 6 isozyme genloci with altogether 19 alleles were investigated (Table 2). Results of data analysis revealed a high level of genetic variation within the investgated populations with a mean number of alleles per locus (A/L) of 2.6, a diversity (upsilon) of 1.48, an expected beterozygosity (H-e) of 31.6% and an observed heterozygosity (H-o) of 34.0%. The largest variation (1.6 less than or equal to upsilon less than or equal to 1.7, 36.4% less than or equal to H-e less than or equal to 41.4%) was found in the populations Hedemundener Gerneindewald (HM), Burgberg Thurnhosbach (TH) and Lohkopf (LK). The stands Naturwaldzelle Eichenberg (NZ, Abt. 249) and Naturwaldzelle Eichenberg (NWZ, Abt. 250) were genetically the least variable (1.2 less than or equal to upsilon less than or equal to 1.3, 19.6% less than or equal to H-c less than or equal to 24.2%) (Table 3). Comparisons between the genetic structures of male and female trees within stands indicated remarkable differences which were probably caused by genetic drift (Table 4). Variation between populations was measured using genetic distance d(o) and genetic differentiation D-j. The stands Burgberg Thurnhosbach (TH) and Lohkopf (LK) differed from the others substantially both in genetic distance (Table 5, Figure 1) and in genetic differentiation (Figure 3) concerning genetic structures. The mean differentiation 6 between stands amounted to 19.5% (Figure 3). Over all observed gene loci, the genetic structures of those stands which are located in the same geographical areas showed the smallest differences (Figure 1). Regarding the relatively high genetic variation within and the high differentiation between yew stands, it appears necessary to plan conservation measures on a broad basis of stands. The analysis of genetic variation within and between populations of yew was completed by cpDNA analysis at 5 trees per stand, respectively. As compared with other conifers like Abies alba and Picea abies with considerable variability, no cp-DNA variation has been observed for Taxus baccata L. in this study."

We tested whether random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers indicate population and (or) regional differentiation in Swiss populations of English yew (Taxus baccata L.), a dioecious forest tree species with scattered distribution. Our sampling included three northern Swiss regions, each containing four populations, and a central- Alpine region with two populations. Four RAPD primers, giving rise to 41 scorable marker bands, identified all but two sampled individuals as unique genotypes. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) detected no significant differentiation among the three northern Swiss regions yet a marginally significant differentiation of these regions versus the central-Alpine region. Concordantly, Mantel tests revealed isolation by distance only when considering all 14 populations.

In effect, local populations suffer from reduction of genetic variation, and thus loss of adaptive capacity, which consequently increases their risk of extinction. In Europe, Taxus baccata is among a number of tree species experiencing strong habitat fragmentation. However, there is little empirical data on the population genetic consequences of fragmentation for this species. This study aimed to characterize local genetic structure in two natural remnants of English yew in Poland based on both amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and microsatellite (SSR) markers. We introduced a Bayesian approach that estimates the average inbreeding coefficient using AFLP (dominant) markers. Results showed that, in spite of high dispersal potential (bird-mediated seed dispersal and wind-mediated pollen dispersal), English yew populations show strong kinship structure, with a spatial extent of 50-100 m, depending on the population. The estimated inbreeding levels ranged from 0.016 to 0.063, depending on the population and marker used. Several patterns were evident: (1) AFLP markers showed stronger kinship structure than SSRs; (2) AFLP markers provided higher inbreeding estimates than SSRs; and (3) kinship structure and inbreeding were more pronounced in denser populations regardless of the marker used. Our results suggest that, because both kinship structure and (bi-parental) inbreeding exist in populations of English yew, gene dispersal can be fairly limited in this species. Furthermore, at a local scale, gene dispersal intensity can be more limited in a dense population."

More than 600 bud samples were collected from seven populations in three regions of the Eastern Alpine mountains for estimating their genetic structures by using isozyme gene markers. Nine gene loci encoding for seven enzyme systems were investigated. The revealed 32 alleles indicate a higher multiplicity of the east alpine gene pool compared with other European regions. English yew showed a high level of genetic variation, with a mean number of alleles per locus (A/L) of 2.7. A total of 76.4% of the loci were polymorphic, the average expected heterozygosity was (H e) 0.274 and the mean observed heterozygosity (H o) was 0.238. The relative proportion of genetic differentiation among the regions was found to be 6.2%, the level of gene flow was high (Nm=3.78) and the level of inbreeding (0.130) among the regions was medium. The obligatory out crossing (dioecious plant), the long generation time, the ability to regenerate from stump and the seed dispersal by birds and rodents might contribute to the high level of genetic variation found within the population. The conservation propositions are discussed with respect to the genetic structure and the poor recruitment of this species."

In this study, we evaluated the utility of five candidate plant DNA barcoding regions [rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, trnL-F and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)] in Eurasian yews. This group of species is taxonomically difficult because of a lack of clear-cut morphologically differences between species and hence represents a good test case for DNA barcoding. Forty-seven accessions were analysed, representing all taxa treated in current floristic works and covering most of the distribution range of Taxus in Eurasia. As single loci, trnL-F and ITS showed the highest species discriminatory power, each resolving 11 of 11 lineages (= barcode taxa). Species discrimination using matK, trnH-psbA and rbcL individually was lower, with matK resolving 8 of 10, trnH-psbA 7 of 11 and rbcL 5 of 11 successfully sequenced lineages. The proposed CBOL core barcode (rbcL + matK) resolved 8 of 11 lineages. Combining loci generally increased the robustness (measured by clade support) of the barcoding discrimination. Based on overall performance, trnL-F and ITS, separately or combined, are proposed as barcode for Eurasian Taxus. DNA barcoding discriminated recognized taxa of Eurasian Taxus, namely T. baccata, T. cuspidata, T. fuana and T. sumatrana, and identified seven lineages among the T. wallichiana group, some with distinct geographical distributions and morphologies, and potentially representing new species. Using the proposed DNA barcode, a technical system can be established to rapidly and reliably identify Taxus species in Eurasia for conservation protection and for monitoring illegal trade."

The genetic diversity of these loci was assessed in 48 individual samples of T. baccata L. All loci were variable: the number of polymorphic alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 9 (average 4.45). The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.15 to 1 and from 0.14 to 0.83, respectively. The loci were informative with polymorphic information content values that ranged from 0.21 to 0.82 (average 0.55). Nineteen of the 31 loci conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations. The loci identified in this study should provide useful tools to study the population structure and genetic diversity of T. baccata L. and promote its management and conservation."

Using six polymorphic gene loci, a total of 16 alleles have been found with a number of nine alleles, which were in common in all populations. In general, the values of observed heterozygosity reflect a very high level of individual genetic variation. Great differences in the relative allele frequencies lead to relatively high gene pool distances between the populations. Whereas the genetic structures of four populations corresponded essentially with the results of publicized investigations of yew populations from other parts of Europe, two occurrences show great differences. The possible reasons of these peculiarities are discussed. Based on the results of the genetic analyses, different measures for the maintenance and development of the genetic resources are recommended. The conservation management on the population level can prevent the possible loss of genetic adaptation as far as the reasons of genetic differences and their importance are not discovered to a sufficient extent."

Among additional factors, the mode of DNA inheritance and dioecy influence SGS. However, their joint impact on SGS remains unclear, especially in the case of paternally inherited DNA. Using theoretical approximations and computer simulations, here we showed that the relative intensity of SGS measured in paternally and biparentally inherited DNA in a dioecious plant population depends on both the proportion of males and the pollen-to-seed dispersal ratio. As long as males do not prevail in a population, SGS is more intense in paternally than biparentally inherited DNA. When males prevail, the intensity of SGS in paternally vs biparentally inherited DNA depends on the compound effect of sex proportions and the pollen-to-seed dispersal ratio. To empirically validate our predictions, we used the case of Taxus baccata, a dioecious European tree. First, we showed that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in T. baccata is predominantly (98%) paternally inherited. Subsequently, using nuclear DNA (nuDNA) and mitochondrial microsatellite data, we compared the fine-scale SGS intensity at both marker types in two natural populations. The population with equal sex proportions showed stronger SGS in mtDNA than in nuDNA. On the other hand, we found lower SGS intensity in mtDNA than in nuDNA in the population with 67% males. Thus, the empirical results provided good support for the theoretical predictions, suggesting that knowledge about SGS in paternally vs biparentally inherited DNA may provide insight into effective sex proportions within dioecious populations."

In the present study, we determined the level of genetic variation and genetic differentiation of thirty-one natural T. baccata populations in Poland (2725 individuals) and focused on the impact of demographic processes on the species' population structure using five nuclear microsatellite loci. The populations demonstrated generally moderate to high levels of genetic diversity (AR = 2.4-12.5; H-o = 0.262-0.593; H-e = 0.441-0.839). The genetic differentiation between populations was geographically structured and occurred at a moderate level (F-st = 0.155). A Bayesian analysis identified a significant north-south population structure. Additionally, populations showed significant isolation by distance, suggesting the recent isolation and fragmentation of local T. baccata populations. All the examined populations experienced a demographic bottleneck and significant fluctuations in size. The improved understanding of genetic variation has practical implications for developing conservation strategies for this rare and endangered forest species. Our study supplements the limited knowledge regarding the fine-scale genetic structure of T. baccata; thus, the Polish populations are now among the most-surveyed stands of this species in Europe. Based on our findings, we suggest that the gene pools of T. baccata should be actively preserved and that local populations should be prioritized according to their potential significance for in situ or ex situ conservation."
