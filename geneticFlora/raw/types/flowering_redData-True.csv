Therefore, I studied the phylogeographical history of Linnaea borealis subsp. borealis to shed light on the colonization history of this clonal self-incompatible polyploid plant in Eurasia using selected regions of plastid DNA and genetic diversity patterns of 22 populations of this species employing AFLP markers. I also addressed the question of whether the genetic diversity patterns in L.borealis subsp. borealis in Eurasia are similar to those of earlier published studies of clonal self-incompatible diploid or polyploid plants. This survey revealed that the shallow phylogeographical history (six plastid haplotypes forming one haplogroup, 100% bootstrap support) and moderate genome-wide diversity estimated using AFLP markers (Frag(poly)=10.8-38.9%, I=0.060-0.180, F-ST=0.289) were general characteristics of L.borealis subsp. borealis in its Eurasian range. The sampling strategy, in most cases at 1-2-m or even 3-5-m intervals, showed that a balance between vegetative and sexual reproduction and limited pollen dispersal among compatible mates can be important for genetic diversity patterns in populations of this taxon. Despite the fact that one-half of the investigated populations were strongly isolated, they still preserved similar levels of genetic diversity across the geographical range. I found no support for the hypothesis that a bottleneck and/or inbreeding had accompanied habitat fragmentation as factors shaping genetic diversity."

However, the behaviour of clonal plants ranges between multiclonality and uniclonality, depending on environmental conditions and life history traits. Allozyme electrophoresis of band phenotypes was used to examine the genetic structure of 13 cytotype-uniform and 17 cytotype-mixed populations of polyploid Allium oleraceum (2n = 4x, 5x, 6x), a clonal bulbous geophyte that has been considered seed-sterile and completely reliant on vegetative reproduction through aerial bulbils and daughter bulbs. The genetic structure was dominated by low within-population variation whereas genetic differentiation was high among populations. Eighty-five distinct multilocus genotypes were found among 756 sampled individuals, but populations generally exhibited a low level of clonal diversity. Tetra- and pentaploids showed twofold higher total and within-population diversity, but also had more genetically differentiated populations in comparison with hexaploids. Tetraploids formed two separate groups in the cluster analysis, and this finding most likely suggests their different origin. Pentaploids were grouped in a separate cluster and frequently intermixed with tetra- and hexaploids sampled at cytotype-mixed sites. Such a pattern suggests gene flow between cytotypes. Most hexaploids were genetically similar and clustered separately from the other cytotypes, suggesting their similar origin and absence of gene flow to and from other cytotypes. Identical band phenotypes found in coexisting cytotypes within certain mixed-ploidy populations might indicate in situ neopolyploidization. Collectively, the pattern of genetic structure and diversity observed in A. oleraceum is typical of clonal plants with the dominance of vegetative offspring and scarce recruitment of sexual offspring. The low and spatially unstructured genetic variation observed in hexaploids, in contrast with higher and spatially structured genetic variation in tetra- and pentaploids, seems to be related to different levels of sexual fertility, ecological amplitude and colonization abilities of the cytotypes. It provides evidence for the existence of both primary and secondary contact zones of cytotypes in A. oleraceum."

Diverse adaptive and non-adaptive mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to these spatial patterns. A long-standing hypothesis holds that polyploids are established and persist due to specialization to different ecological conditions compared to their progenitors. However, experimental approaches testing this hypothesis remain rare. Empirical evidence for niche differences among ploidy levels has been found previously for the European polyploid geophyte Allium oleraceum. Here, we conducted a 5-year reciprocal transplant experiment with tetraploid, pentaploid and hexaploid A. oleraceum to test for adaptation at the ploidy and population levels. Methods In 2006, we sowed 2160 aerial bulbils among six sites (two per cytotype, central and western Moravia, the Czech Republic) and monitored their emergence in 2007, their survival until 2011 and their performance in 2011. Important Findings The emergence of bulbils was high at all target sites, and no evidence for niche differentiation among cytotypes was recorded in the first year. Survival in the following years was relatively high, but significantly better survival for plants of home ploidy than foreign ploidy was recorded. No plant reached the reproductive stage during our experiment. Adopting a strict definition of local adaptation, local plants only rarely performed better than foreign plants at both sites in pairwise comparisons within a cytotype. Together, our results suggest weak niche differentiation among cytotypes and provide limited support for the existence of local adaptation within cytotypes. Thus, all cytotypes are able to establish in habitats typically populated by other cytotypes via aerial bulbil spread, but will likely die out gradually in non-native habitats. This ability may explain the occurrence of some multiple-cytotype populations. The complex spatial pattern of A. oleraceum cytotypes is therefore the result of several interacting factors, including niche differentiation among cytotypes, the different evolutionary ages of cytotypes, the existence of gene flow between and within cytotypes, the dominance of clonality and stochastic events linked to anthropogenic dispersal and disturbance."

However, some primarily arctic-alpine plants also occur in the afro-alpine mountains. It has been suggested that these plants are Tertiary relicts, but a recent worldwide study of Arabis alpina suggests that this species colonized the region twice during the Pleistocene. Here we investigate the detailed colonization history of A. alpina in the afro-alpine region based on chloroplast DNA sequences from 11 mountain systems. The results confirm the twice-into-Africa scenario. The Asian lineage is confined to the mountains closest to the Arabian Peninsula, on opposite sides of the Rift Valley (Simen Mts and Gara Muleta in Ethiopia), suggesting long-distance dispersal of this lineage. The African lineage is divided into two phylogeographic groups with distinct geographic distribution. The observed pattern is consistent with isolation of the African lineage in at least two interglacial refugia, located on separated highlands, followed by range expansion in cooler period(s), when the afro-alpine habitat extended further down the mountains. Several long-distance dispersal events, also across the Rift Valley, are suggested by single haplotypes observed outside the area occupied by the phylogeographic groups they belonged to."

We used amplified fragment length polymorphism data to compare the genetic structure of Arabis alpina, a widespread arctic-alpine and afro-alpine plant, in three distinct parts of its range: the North Atlantic region, which was recolonized after the last ice age, the European Alps, where range shifts were probably primarily altitudinal, and the high mountains of East Africa, where the contemporary mountain top populations result from range contraction. Genetic structure was inferred using clustering analyses and estimates of genetic diversity within and between populations. There was virtually no diversity in the vast North Atlantic region, which was probably recolonized from a single refugial population, possibly located between the Alps and the northern ice sheets. In the European mountains, genetic diversity was high and distinct genetic groups had a patchy and sometimes disjunct distribution. In the African mountains, genetic diversity was high, clearly structured and partially in accordance with a previous chloroplast phylogeography. The fragmented structure in the European and African mountains indicated that A. alpina disperses little among established populations. Occasional long-distance dispersal events were, however, suggested in all regions. The lack of genetic diversity in the north may be explained by leading-edge colonization by this pioneer plant in glacier forelands, closely following the retracting glaciers. Overall, the genetic structure observed corresponded to the expectations based on the environmental history of the different regions."

It grows in all major mountain ranges within the Italian glacial refugia and populations were sampled over a 1300 km transect from Sicily to the Alps. Diversity was studied in nuclear and chloroplast genome markers, combining phylogeographical and population genetic approaches. Alpine populations had significantly lower levels of nuclear genetic variation compared to those in the Italian Peninsula, and this is associated with a pronounced change in within-population inbreeding. Alpine populations were significantly inbred (F-IS = 0.553), possibly reflecting a change to the self-incompatibility system during leading edge colonization. The Italian Peninsula populations were approaching Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (outbreeding, F-IS = 0.076) and genetic variation was highly structured, consistent with independent local 'refugia within refugia' and the fragmentation of an established population by Quaternary climate oscillations. There is very little evidence of genetic exchange between the Alps and the Italian Peninsula main distribution ranges. The Alps functioned as a glacial sink for A. alpina, while the Italian Peninsula remains a distinct and separate long-term refugium. Comparative analysis indicated that inbreeding populations probably recolonized the Alps twice: (i) during a recent postglacial colonization of the western Alps from a Maritime Alps refugium; and (ii) separately into the central Alps from a source outside the sampling range. The pronounced geographical structure and inbreeding discontinuities are significant for the future development of A. alpina as a model species."

One way of identifying loci that are possibly under selection is to see which ones are associated with environmental gradient or heterogeneity. Since it is difficult to measure all environmental variables, one may take advantage of the spatial nature of environmental filters to incorporate the effect of unaccounted environmental variables in the analysis. Assuming that the spatial signature of these variables is broad-scaled, broad-scale Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) can be included as explanatory variables in the analysis as proxies for unmeasured environmental variables. We applied this approach to two data sets of the alpine plant Arabis alpina. The first consisted of 140 AFLP loci sampled at 130 sites across the European Alps (large scale). The second one consisted of 712 AFLP loci sampled at 93 sites (regional scale) in three mountain massifs (local scale) of the French Alps. For each scale, we regressed the frequencies of each AFLP allele on a set of eco-climatic and MEM variables as predictors. Twelve (large scale) and 11% (regional scale) of all loci were detected as significantly correlated to at least one of the predictors (R-adj(2) > 0.5), and, except for one massif, 17% at the local scale. After accounting for spatial effects, temperature and precipitation were the two major determinants of allele distributions. Our study shows how MEM models can account for unmeasured environmental variation in landscape genetics models."

We used an unusually large genome scan [825 amplified fragment length polymorphism loci (AFLPs)] and four environmental variables related to temperature, precipitation and topography. We detected linkage disequilibrium among only 3.5% of the considered AFLP loci. A population structure analysis identified no admixture in the study regions, and the French and Swiss Alps were differentiated and therefore could be considered as two independent regions. We applied generalized estimating equations (GEE) to detect ecologically relevant loci separately in the French and Swiss Alps. We identified 78 loci of ecological relevance (9%), which were mainly related to mean annual minimum temperature. Only four of these loci were common across the French and Swiss Alps. Finally, we discuss that the genomic characterization of these ecologically relevant loci, as identified in this study, opens up new perspectives for studying functional ecology in A. alpina, its relatives and other alpine plant species."

It is described as either a centre of origin and long-term Pleistocene refugium, or as a centre for genetic amalgamation, fed from distinct neighbouring refugia. These contrasting hypotheses are tested through a global phylogeographic analysis of the arctic-alpine herb, Arabis alpina. Methods Herbarium and field collections were used to sample comprehensively the entire global range, with special focus on Anatolia and Levant. Sequence variation in the chloroplast DNA trnL-trnF region was examined in 483 accessions. A haplotype genealogy was constructed and phylogeographic methods, demographic analysis and divergence time estimations were used to identify the centres of diversity and to infer colonization history. Key Results Fifty-seven haplotypes were recovered, belonging to three haplogroups with non-overlapping distributions in (1) North America/Europe/northern Africa, (2) the Caucuses/Iranian Plateau/Arabian Peninsula and (3) Ethiopia-eastern Africa. All haplogroups occur within Anatolia, and all intermediate haplotypes linking the three haplogroups are endemic to central Anatolia and Levant, where haplotypic and nucleotide diversities exceeded all other regions. The local pattern of haplotype distribution strongly resembles the global pattern, and the haplotypes began to diverge approx. 2.7 Mya, coinciding with the climate cooling of the early Middle Pleistocene. Conclusions The phylogeographic structure of Arabis alpina is consistent with Anatolia being the cradle of origin for global genetic diversification. The highly structured landscape in combination with the Pleistocene climate fluctuations has created a network of mountain refugia and the accumulation of spatially arranged genotypes. This local Pleistocene population history has subsequently left a genetic imprint at the global scale, through four range expansions from the Anatolian diversity centre into Europe, the Near East, Arabia and Africa. Hence this study also illustrates the importance of sampling and scaling effects when translating global from local diversity patterns during phylogeographic analyses."

Arabis alpina is currently being developed as a model system for studying the ecological genetics of arctic-alpine environments, and is the focus of numerous studies on population structure and alpine phylogeography. Although it is highly inbreeding throughout most of its range, populations in central Italy have been identified that show inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) more typical of self-incompatible relatives. The purpose of this study was to establish whether this variation is due to a functioning SI system. Methods Outcrossing rate estimates were calculated based on 16 allozyme loci and self-compatibility assessed based on controlled pollinations for six Italian populations that have previously been shown to vary in FIS values. Putative SRK alleles (the gene controlling the female component of SI in other Brassicaceae) amplified from A. alpina were compared with those published for other species. Linkage of putative SRK alleles and SI phenotypes was assessed using a diallel cross. Key Results Functional avoidance of inbreeding is demonstrated in three populations of A. alpina, corresponding with previous FIS values. The presence is described of 15 putative SRK-like alleles, which show high sequence identity to known alleles from Brassica and Arabidopsis and the high levels of synonymous and non-synonymous variation typical of genes under balancing selection. Also, orthologues of two other members of the S-receptor kinase gene family, Aly8 (ARK3) and Aly9 (AtS1) are identified. Further to this, co-segregation between some of the putative S-alleles and compatibility phenotypes was demonstrated using a full-sibling cross design. Conclusions The results strongly suggest that, as with other species in the Brassicaceae, A. alpina has a sporophytic SI system but shows variation in the strength of SI within and between populations."

However, contemporary gene flow is not well understood across alpine landscapes. The aim of this study was to estimate contemporary gene flow through pollen and to examine the realized mating system in the alpine perennial plant, Arabis alpina (Brassicaceae). An entire sub-alpine to alpine landscape of 2 km(2) was exhaustively sampled in the Swiss Alps. Eighteen nuclear microsatellite loci were used to genotype 595 individuals and 499 offspring from 49 maternal plants. Contemporary gene flow by pollen was estimated from paternity analysis, matching the genotypes of maternal plants and offspring to the pool of likely father plants. Realized mating patterns and genetic structure were also estimated. Paternity analysis revealed several long-distance gene flow events (1 km). However, most outcrossing pollen was dispersed close to the mother plants, and 84 of all offspring were selfed. Individuals that were spatially close were more related than by chance and were also more likely to be connected by pollen dispersal. In the alpine landscape studied, genetic structure occurred on small spatial scales as expected for alpine plants. However, gene flow also covered large distances. This makes it plausible for alpine plants to spread beneficial alleles at least via pollen across landscapes at a short time scale. Thus, gene flow potentially facilitates rapid adaptation in A. alpina likely to be required under ongoing climate change."

Population genetic studies have reported the existence of both outcrossing and selfing populations in Arabis alpina (Brassicaceae), which is an emerging model species for studying the molecular basis of perenniality and local adaptation. It is unknown whether its selfing populations have evolved a selfing syndrome. Methods Using macro-photography, microscopy and automated cell counting, we compared floral syndromes (size, herkogamy, pollen and ovule numbers) between three outcrossing populations from the Apuan Alps and three selfing populations from the Western and Central Alps (Maritime Alps and Dolomites). In addition, we genotyped the plants for 12 microsatellite loci to confirm previous measures of diversity and inbreeding coefficients based on allozymes, and performed Bayesian clustering. Results and Discussion Plants from the three selfing populations had markedly smaller flowers, less herkogamy and lower pollen production than plants from the three outcrossing populations, whereas pistil length and ovule number have remained constant. Compared to allozymes, microsatellite variation was higher, but revealed similar patterns of low diversity and high Fis in selfing populations. Bayesian clustering revealed two clusters. The first cluster contained the three outcrossing populations from the Apuan Alps, the second contained the three selfing populations from the Maritime Alps and Dolomites. Conclusion We conclude that in comparison to three outcrossing populations, three populations with high selfing rates are characterised by a flower morphology that is closer to the selfing syndrome. The presence of outcrossing and selfing floral syndromes within a single species will facilitate unravelling the genetic basis of the selfing syndrome, and addressing which selective forces drive its evolution."

To quantify adaptive differentiation in the arctic-alpine perennial herb Arabis alpina, we conducted reciprocal transplant experiments for 3yr between Spanish and Scandinavian populations. At the sites of one Spanish and one Scandinavian population, we planted seedlings representing two Spanish and four Scandinavian populations, and recorded survival, flowering propensity and fecundity. The experiment was replicated in two subsequent years. The results demonstrate strong adaptive differentiation between A.alpina populations from the two regions. At the field site in Spain, survival and fruit production of Spanish populations were higher than those of Scandinavian populations, while the opposite was true at the site in Scandinavia, and these differences were consistent across years. By comparison, fitness varied little among populations from the same region.

Although theory predicts that intermediate outcrossing rates may allow plants to prevent accumulation of deleterious alleles, few studies have empirically tested this prediction using genomic data. Here, we study the effect of mating system on purifying selection by conducting population-genomic analyses on whole-genome resequencing data from 38 European individuals of the arctic-alpine crucifer Arabis alpina. We find that outcrossing and mixed-mating populations maintain genetic diversity at similar levels, whereas highly self-fertilizing Scandinavian A. alpina show a strong reduction in genetic diversity, most likely as a result of a postglacial colonization bottleneck. We further find evidence for accumulation of genetic load in highly self-fertilizing populations, whereas the genome-wide impact of purifying selection does not differ greatly between mixed-mating and outcrossing populations. Our results demonstrate that intermediate levels of outcrossing may allow efficient selection against harmful alleles, whereas demographic effects can be important for relaxed purifying selection in highly selfing populations. Thus, mating system and demography shape the impact of purifying selection on genomic variation in A. alpina. These results are important for an improved understanding of the evolutionary consequences of mating system variation and the maintenance of mixed-mating strategies."

Local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are two important characteristics of alpine plants to overcome the threats caused by global changes. Among alpine species, Arabis alpina is characterised by an unusually wide altitudinal amplitude, ranging from 800 to 3,100 m of elevation in the French Alps. Two non-exclusive hypotheses can explain the presence of A. alpina across this broad ecological gradient: adaptive phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation, making this species especially useful to better understand these phenomena in alpine plant species. 2. We carried out common garden experiments at two different elevations with maternal progenies from six sites that differed in altitude. We showed that (1) key phenotypic traits (morphotype, total fruit length, growth, height) display significant signs of local adaptation, (2) most traits studied are characterised by a high phenotypic plasticity between the two experimental gardens and (3) the two populations from the highest elevations lacked morphological plasticity compared to the other populations. 3. By combining two genome scan approaches (detection of selection and association methods), we isolated a candidate gene (Sucrose-Phosphate Synthase 1). This gene was associated with height and local average temperature in our studied populations, consistent with previous studies on this gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. 4. Synthesis. Given the nature of the traits involved in the detected pattern of local adaptation and the relative lack of plasticity of the two most extreme populations, our findings are consistent with a scenario of a locally adaptive stress response syndrome in high elevation populations. Due to a reduced phenotypic plasticity, an overall low intra-population genetic diversity of the adaptive traits and weak gene flow, populations of high altitude might have difficulties to cope with, e.g. a rise of temperature."

These range contractions had major impacts on the spatial genetic structure of alpine species. Consequently, one should take into account the often complex phylogeographic structure of species when performing genomic research, e.g. on signatures of local adaptation. Understanding the phylogeography of the widespread arctic and alpine Arabis alpina is particularly important, as this species is developing into a model species for ecological genetics. The first objective of this study was to assess the genetic variation of A. alpina across the Alps and to compare the spatial genetic patterns resulting from two different types of molecular markers, namely nuclear microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). A second objective was to infer the distribution of genetic variation at the regional scale to understand the genetic structure of populations in the area of a previously suggested contact zone between genetic clusters that presumably recolonised their current range from different glacial refugia. We characterized the phylogeographic structure of 372 individuals from 127 populations across the entire Alpine range, complemented by 364 individuals from 22 populations in the western Swiss Alps. Nuclear microsatellite and AFLP markers described consistent population clustering, coherent with previous phylogeographic analyses. Furthermore, regional population structure in the western Alps of Switzerland highlighted a contact zone of genetic clusters associated with different presumed refugia. Again, this finding was in accordance with recolonisation routes formerly inferred for other plant taxa of the western Swiss Alps. Our results highlight the coincidence of large-scale patterns of genetic structure among alternative types of molecular markers and set a valuable basis for further studies on ecological genomics in A. alpina."

Variation at these loci is amenable to a diversity of applications including population genetics, phylogeographical analyses, mapping of inter and intraspecific crosses, and recombination mapping.

Analysis of microsatellite structure in the related species showed that there had been large changes in the microsatellites: there were large differences in repeat numbers and many of the A. thaliana simple repeats were shorter in the related species. For the loci we compared, the related species had a much lower level of variability at the microsatellites than Japanese wild populations of A. thaliana.

The relative evolutionary importance of these two modes has been debated; the former mode is emphasized in the "dominance hypothesis," the latter in the "overdominance hypothesis." We analyzed the genetic basis of inbreeding depression in the self-incompatible herb Arabis petraea (L.) Lam.: In the selfed progeny of twelve parental plants, we studied the proportion of chlorophyll-deficient seedlings, the genotypic distributions of marker genes, and associations of marker genotypes with viability and quantitative traits. Early components of fitness were examined by scoring seed size, germination time, and early growth rate and by observing the proportion of chlorophyll-deficient seedlings. Later components of fitness, flowering, and root and aboveground biomass were also measured. Marker genotypes of young seedlings were scored for 11 enzyme loci and three microsatellite markers. We found a high proportion (about 70%) of families with chlorophyll-deficient seedlings, indicating a high mutational load. We found six significant deviations from 1:2:1 ratio at marker loci of 60 tests in seedlings, with three of these significant at the experimentwide level. Deviations from the expected ratio were assumed to be due to linked viability loci. A graphical and a Bayesian method were used to distinguish between the overdominance and dominance hypotheses. Most of the deviant segregation ratios suggested overdominance instead of recessivity of the deleterious allele. Neither the early (seed size, germination time, or early growth trait) nor the late quantitative traits (flowering, and root and aboveground biomass) showed significant linkage to markers at the experimentwide level. Presence of significant associations between markers and early viability, but lack thereof for quantitative traits expressed late, suggests either that there may be relatively low inbreeding depression in later life stages or that individual quantitative trait loci may have smaller effects than loci contributing to early viability."

This study provides a survey of the Great Lakes region of Canada to determine the extent of this mating system variation and how outcrossing rates are related to current population density, geographical distribution, and genetic diversity. Based on variation at microsatellite markers (progeny arrays to estimate multilocus outcrossing rates and population samples to estimate diversity measures) and controlled greenhouse pollinations, populations can be divided into two groups: W group A, consisting of individuals capable of setting selfed seed (including autogamous fruit set in the absence of pollinators), showing depressed outcrossing rates (T-m = 0.2-0.6), heterozygosity (H-O = 0.02-0.06) and genetic diversity (H-E = 0.08-0.10); and (ii) group B, consisting of individuals that are predominantly self-incompatible (T-m > 0.8), require pollinators for seeds set, and showing higher levels of heterozygosity (H-O = 0.13-0.31) and diversity (H-E = 0.19-0.410). Current population density is not related to the shift in mating system but does vary with latitude. Restricted gene flow among populations was evident among all but two populations (F-ST = 0.11-0.8). Group A populations were more differentiated from one another (F-ST = 0.78) than they were from group B populations (F-ST = 0.59), with 41% of the variation partitioned within populations, 47% between populations, and 12% between groups.

One population was located in an alpine environment strongly affected by grazing, whereas the other was close to sea level and only moderately affected by herbivory. Multiple regression models indicated directional selection for early end of flowering in one year in the lowland population, and directional selection for early start of flowering in one year in the alpine population. As expected, there was selection for more inflorescences in the lowland population. However, in the alpine population, plants with many inflorescences were selectively grazed and the number of inflorescences produced was negatively related to female fitness in one year and not significantly related to female fitness in the second year. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic differentiation in flowering phenology between the study populations is adaptive, and indicate that interactions with selective grazers may strongly influence selection on floral display in A. lyrata."

Therefore protection plans are crucially needed and call for thoroughly documenting the genetic diversity and clarifying the taxonomy of this endangered genus. Our sampling included 282 individuals from 42 natural populations and covered the whole geographical range of the genus, across Europe and the Mediterranean. We combined sequencing of nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplastic trnL-ndhF regions with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotyping to investigate the Alismataceae phylogeny, and produce a phylogeography of Baldellia. Our phylogeny strongly supported the monophyly of Baldellia and placed it as the sister clade to Luronium and Alisma, therefore excluding, as previously supposed, a close genetic relatedness to the predominantly neotropical genus Echinodorus. The phylogeography of Baldellia outlined patterns consistent with a hypothesis considering glacial refugia located in the Iberian Peninsula and the Italy/Balkan region from which two distinct genetic lineages re-colonized Europe. These two lineages corresponded respectively to Baldellia ranunculoides (Italy/Balkan derived populations) and Baldellia repens (populations recovered from the Iberian Peninsula refuge), therefore supporting differences outlined between the two taxa in previous ecological and morphological studies. These results allowed clarifying taxonomic uncertainties by confirming the genetic distinctness of B. repens according to B. ranunculoides. A third lineage, Baldellia alpestris, originated and remained endemic to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. Unexpectedly, B. repens populations collected in northern Africa, appeared to be genetically distinct from their European counterparts, this calls for further investigation to fully address their genetic and conservation status. Finally, we detected a large hybridization zone in northwestern Europe between B. repens and B. ranunculoides. These results were discussed in light of conservation approaches for Baldellia populations."

Distinctive features of the Brachypodium genome are its small size, the low amount of repetitive DNA, the lack of restriction fragment length polymorphisms within the genus for the assayed probe/enzyme combinations, and the genomic variability demonstrated at species level by random DNA amplification. These molecular studies confirm Brachypodium as an isolated ancient genus best placed in its own tribe (Brachypodieae). Its relationships to other tribes-Bromeae, Triticeae, Poeae-are resolved, Brachypodieae being the earliest tribe to diverge from this core of pooids. Within the genus two major Old World clades are distinguishable: an annual clade, represented only by B. distachyon; and a perennial clade, represented by all the other species studied (except B. mexicanum). The perennial American species B. mexicanum appears equally attached to these two clades.

Of them, the genus Callitriche is particularly interesting because of such evolutionary features as wide variation in chromosome numbers and pollination systems. However, taxonomic difficulties have prevented broader investigation of this genus. In this study we applied flow cytometry to Callitriche for the first time in order to gain an insight into evolutionary processes and genome size differentiation in the genus. Flow cytometry complemented by confirmation of chromosome counts was applied to an extensive dataset of 1077 Callitriche individuals from 495 localities in 11 European countries and the USA. Genome size was determined for 12 taxa. The results suggest that many important processes have interacted in the evolution of the genus, including polyploidization and hybridization. Incongruence between genome size and ploidy level, intraspecific variation in genome size, formation of autotriploid and hybridization between species with different pollination systems were also detected. Hybridization takes place particularly in the diploid - tetraploid complex C. cophocarpa - C. platycarpa, for which the triploid hybrids were frequently recorded in the area of co-occurrence of its parents. A hitherto unknown hybrid (probably C. hamulata x C. cophocarpa) with a unique chromosome number was discovered in the Czech Republic. However, hybridization occurs very rarely among most of the studied species. The main ecological preferences were also compared among the taxa collected. Although Callitriche taxa often grow in mixed populations, the ecological preferences of individual species are distinctly different in some cases. Anyway, flow cytometry is a very efficient method for taxonomic delimitation, determination and investigation of Callitriche species, and is even able to distinguish homoploid taxa and identify introduced species."

The whole complex constitutes a syngameon within which gene flow may occur between taxa. Several more or less distinct evolutionary lineages in the complex are morphologically similar to each other and are often combined into broadly defined taxonomic species. Separate calculations of genetic diversity estimates for the most narrowly defined species revealed clear differences between some of the taxa; for instance, C. flava s. s. had a very low value for individual gene diversity, H-1 whereas C. hostiana and C. lepidocarpa ssp. lepidocarpa had high values for total genetic diversity, H-T Amounts of genetic diversity at different hierarchic levels ( H-T, H-S, H-I) generally increased as narrowly defined species were combined into more broadly defined species. However, combining ecological species ( ecotypes) within C. oederi s. l. had little effect on estimates of genetic diversity. The proportion of genetic diversity due to variation between populations, G(ST), increased initially as ecologically and/ or geographically separated lineages were amalgamated, but decreased as the species were even more boradly circumscribed to include distinct lineages growing in mixed populations. The proportion of genetic diversity due to variation between individuals within populations ( numerically equivalent to the inbreeding coefficient, F-IS) was dependent on the degree of hybridization and introgression at sites with mixed populations and was found to increase or decrease when taxa became more broadly circumscribed. It is concluded that differences in species circumscription may have dramatic effects on genetic diversity estimates, and it is recommended that calculations should be performed separately for separate evolutionary lineages in order to obtain comparable estimates for different plant groups."

Carex lepidocarpa ssp. jemtlandica was allozymically divergent from ssp. lepidocarpa, indicating a long period of isolation-of the two subspecies. A poor morphological separation in some localities is apparently due to secondary contacts in connection with recolonization of Fennoscandia after the last ice age, resulting in the formation of fertile hybrids and back-crosses. The subdivision of C. oederi into three varieties is supported by ecological data and it is suggested that they have originated by parallel ecotype formation under similar selective regimes in different areas. However, the varietal limits are not-supported by differentiation in neutral (allozyme) characters. A phylogenetic hypothesis was constructed by means of neighbour-joining based allozyme data and it was indicated that C demissa may be more closely related to C lepidocarpa than to C oederi.

Analysis of 11 morphometric characters using principal component analysis and examination of 17 isozyme loci revealed a more complicated history than that suggested by morphometric analysis alone. Results from this study confirm the status of an additional British population of C. flava s.str. and also strongly suggest that a population morphologically resembling Carex lepidocarpa has experienced the introgression of C. flava genes in the past. An Irish population resembling C. flava in appearance but lacking typical C. flava allozymes may be a result of local selection."

Microsatellite-based, dominant inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) fingerprinting revealed no taxon-specific variation among five investigated Carex species or hybrids, while in codominant microsatellite genotyping, 5 out of 16 alleles were taxon specific. Despite significant genetic differentiation, our results demonstrate that there is also gene flow between taxa. Although principal component analysis (PCA) showed some structuring among groups, there was considerable overlapping. The analysis of genetic differentiation assessed for the expected five groups using the program Structure did not provide conclusive results for the number of main groups. However, it is visible that C. aquatilis and C. paleacea are genetically distinct, while the other studied taxa show intermediate genetic features. Both the microsatellite analysis and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region supported the view that the parental species of C. recta are C. aquatilis and C. paleacea, although with unequal contribution. C. paleacea x recta is likely to possess additional genetic material apart from that originating from C. aquatilis and C. paleacea. Our study shows that ISSR markers failed to be sufficiently informative, but the combination of sequencing (ITS) and the use of microsatellite genotyping proved their applicability in resolving fine-scale taxonomic questions."

The two main hypotheses are: (1) postglacial colonization from refugia outside this region; (2) glacial survival in microclimatically favourable sites within the periglacial areas. In order to clarify the glacial history of a boreo-montane tall forb, we analysed AFLPs from populations of Cicerbita alpina through most of its range (Scandinavia, the mountains of central Europe, the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Balkan Peninsula). We found a major differentiation between the Pyrenean population and all others, supported by principal coordinate, neighbour joining and STRUCTURE analyses. Furthermore, three populations from the central and north-eastern Alps were genetically distinct from the bulk of populations from Scandinavia, central Europe, the Alps and the Balkan Peninsula. Most populations, including those from central and northern Europe, had moderate to high levels of genetic diversity (mean Shannon index H-Sh = 0.292, mean percentage of polymorphic loci P = 54.1%, mean Nei's gene diversity H = 0.195). The results indicate separate glacial refugia in the Pyrenean region and the Italian Alps.

(Colchicaceae) is classed as an endangered plant species in Ireland, with a highly localised distribution centred on the Nore Valley in the southeast. The high resolution Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism genetic fingerprinting technique was used to clarify a question over the native status of the species and to assess its Irish conservation status through comparison with populations throughout northwestern Europe. The analysis of 20 populations with three selective primer pairs yielded 155 markers, 90% of which displayed polymorphism. Allele frequency was estimated using a Bayesian approach and based on this, total gene diversity (Ht) was 0.305 and mean within-population gene diversity (Hw) was 0.142. Irish populations contain comparatively moderate levels of genetic diversity and are unlikely to be susceptible to the deleterious effects of inbreeding depression. Analysis of Molecular Variance revealed that populations were significantly differentiated, with 68% of variation partitioned among populations and 32% within. Neighbour-joining and ordination analyses revealed a major biogeographic division between populations, suggesting that post-glacial migration in northwest Europe was driven from at least two separate glacial refugia and that the re-colonisation of Britain and Ireland is likely to have occurred via a western seaboard route from an Iberian glacial refugium. The total evidence points to C. autumnale being a native component of the Irish flora and its endangered IUCN (World Conservation Union) country status should therefore make it a priority for national conservation efforts. The study illustrates the point that a broader geographical perspective is fundamental to the assessment of the conservation status of regionally threatened plant species."

Plants were sampled from the river Loire (France) representing subcentral populations and the rivers Rhine, Weser and Elbe (Germany) representing peripheral ones. Allozyme electrophoresis revealed 17 putative loci in II enzyme systems. at the species level, percentage polymorphic loci, mean number of alleles, observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity were P=29%, A=1.5  0.2, Ho=0.007  0.005 and He=0.065  0.035, respectively. Peripheral populations were smaller in number and showed decreased levels of genetic diversity relative to central populations. Corrigiola litoralis was highly inbreeding as indicated by a mean F-IS of 0.755. Genetic differentiation among populations was high with a mean F-ST-value of 0.585. Hierarchical F-statistics revealed that genetic variability was partitioned at 57% among sites, 52% among countries and 11% among sites within countries. Genetic distances between French and German populations were 0.08, indicative of considerable differentiation at the intraspecific level. The overall low level of allozyme diversity is attributed to the breeding system and to habitat conditions homogenized by regular flooding. The decrease in diversity from subcentral to peripheral populations is considered to be a result of drift and founder effects during postglacial recolonization.

P.Beauv. is an outbreeding, short-lived and wind-dispersed grass species, highly specialised on scattered and disturbance-dependent habitats of open sandy sites. Its distribution ranges from the Iberian Peninsula over Atlantic regions of Western and Central Europe, but excludes the two other classical European glacial refuge regions on the Apennine and Balkan Peninsulas. To investigate genetic patterns of this uncommon combination of ecological and biogeographic species characteristics, we analysed AFLP variation among 49 populations throughout the European distribution range, expecting (i) patterns of SW European glacial refugia and post-glacial expansion to the NE; (ii) decreasing genetic diversity from central to marginal populations; and (iii) interacting effects of high gene flow and disturbance-driven genetic drift. Decreasing genetic diversity from SW to NE and distinct gene pool clustering imply refugia on the Iberian Peninsula and in western France, from where range expansion originated towards the NE. High genetic diversity within and moderate genetic differentiation among populations, and a significant pattern of isolation-by-distance indicate a gene flow drift equilibrium within C.canescens, probably due to its restriction to scattered and dynamic habitats and limited dispersal distances. These features, as well as the re-colonisation history, were found to affect genetic diversity gradients from central to marginal populations. Our study emphasises the need for including the specific ecology into analyses of species (re-)colonisation histories and range centre-margin analyses. To account for discontinuous distributions, new indices of marginality were tested for their suitability in studies of centre-periphery gradients."

Asch as a basis for conservation management in Germany","Conservation Genetics","19:527-543","Empirical paper","","","","Plant diversity is decreasing mainly through anthropogenic factors like habitat fragmentation, which lead to spatial separation of remaining populations and thereby affect genetic diversity and structure within species. Twenty populations of the threatened grassland species Crepis mollis were studied across Germany (578 individual plants) based on microsatellite genotyping. Genetic diversity was significantly higher in populations from the Alpine region than from the Central Uplands. Furthermore, genetic diversity was significantly positively correlated with population size. Despite smaller populations in the Uplands there were no signs of inbreeding. Genetic differentiation between populations was moderate (F (ST) = 0.09) and no isolation by distance was found. In contrast, large-scale spatial genetic structure showed a significant decrease of individual pairwise relatedness, which was higher than in random pairs up to 50 km. Bayesian analyses detected three genetic clusters consistent with two regions in the Uplands and an admixture group in the Alpine region. Despite the obvious spatial isolation of the currently known populations, the absence of significant isolation by distance combined together with moderate population differentiation indicates that drift rather than inter-population gene flow drives differentiation. The absence of inbreeding suggests that pollination is still effective, while seed dispersal by wind is likely to be impaired by discontinuous habitats. Our results underline the need for maintaining or improving habitat quality as the most important short term measure for C. mollis. For maintaining long-term viability, establishing stepping stone habitats or, where this is not possible, assisted gene flow needs to be considered."

Although many studies have focused on evolution of invaders particularly in the context of testing the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis, few consistent patterns have emerged. Many tests of the EICA hypothesis have been performed in only one environment; such assessments may be misleading if plants that perform one way at a particular site respond differently across sites. Single common garden tests ignore the potential for important contributions of both genetic and environmental factors to affect plant phenotype. Using a widespread invader in North America, Cynoglossum officinale, we established reciprocal common gardens in the native range (Europe) and introduced range (North America) to assess genetically based differences in size, fecundity, flowering phenology and threshold flowering size between native and introduced genotypes as well as the magnitude of plasticity in these traits. In addition, we grew plants at three nutrient levels in a pot experiment in one garden to test for plasticity across a different set of conditions. We did not find significant genetically based differences between native and introduced populations in the traits we measured; in our experiments, introduced populations of C. officinale were larger and more fecund, but only in common garden experiments in the native range. We found substantial population-level plasticity for size, fecundity and date of first flowering, with plants performing better in a garden in Germany than in Montana. Differentiation of native populations in the magnitude of plasticity was much stronger than that of introduced populations, suggesting an important role for founder effects. We did not detect evidence of an evolutionary change in threshold flowering size. Our study demonstrates that detecting genetically based differences in traits may require measuring plant responses to more than one environment."

We compared the genetic variability and fitness of the rare, short-lived perennial Cynoglossum officinale from 12 botanic gardens and five natural populations in Germany. Genetic variability was assessed with eight nuclear microsatellites. Plants were grown in a common garden and performance was measured over 2 years. Mean genetic diversity was very similar in botanic garden and natural populations. However, four of the garden populations exhibited no genetic variability at all. Moreover, the genetic diversity of garden populations decreased with increasing duration of cultivation, indicating genetic drift. Plant performance from natural and garden populations in terms of growth, flowering and seed production was similar and in garden populations only seed mass was strongly related to genetic diversity. Several lines of evidence indicated genetic changes in garden populations in response to cultivation. Seed dormancy was strongly reduced in garden populations, and in response to nutrient addition garden plants increased the size of their main inflorescence, while wild plants increased the number of inflorescences. These changes could be maladaptive in nature and reduce the suitability of garden populations as a source for reintroductions. We suggest that botanic gardens should pay more attention to the problem of potential genetic changes in their plant collections."

The following specific questions were examined: 1) Do the allozyme data suggest that C. arietinum be transferred to the genus Criosanthes? 2) Do Cypripedium populations contain unusually low levels of genetic variation relative to other angiosperms with comparable life histories? and 3) Is the distribution of genetic variation among populations consistent with the idea that evolutionary processes produce higher levels of among- population differentiation in the Orchidaceae?

Unweighted pair-group method analysis of Nei's genetic identities and a principal components analysis of allele frequencies both revealed a tendency of var. pubescens and var. planipetalum populations to cluster with their respective varieties. However, var. parviflorum displayed a large variance in population differentiation relative to the above taxa. Intravarietal Nei's identity values, which ranged from 0.84 to 1.0, were not consistently higher than intervarietal values (0.75-0.98).

The allelic structure for fragments of the C. calceolus population from the western and eastern parts of the species range differed in two loci, PGI and SKDH: alleles absent in C. calceolus plants from the western part of the range occurred at a high frequency in the plants of this species from the eastern part of the range (28-41% and 55-68%, respectively).

In Denmark there are only two populations, close to each other and situated far from other European stands. One population is stagnant or in slow decline, whereas the other is in rapid increase. We examined the levels of genetic diversity and compatibility and seed quality following experimental crosses. No genetic variation could be detected in plastid and nuclear markers within or between the two populations-in contrast to results previously reported from other European populations of C. calceolus. This may indicate a founder effect in both populations, but it could also be the outcome of prolonged inbreeding or reflect a genetic bottleneck after the populations were established. According to fruit dimensions and frequency of fully developed seeds there was full self-compatibility in the stagnant population, and partial late-acting self-incompatibility in the proliferating population. In combination with previous reports from other countries, this suggests that several self-incompatibility systems may occur in C. calceolus. Seeds from the older and stagnant population performed more poorly in germination tests in vitro than seeds from the thriving population. The difference needs not be genetically based, but could be due to environmental differences during seed maturation, producing different seed quality or dormancy characteristics. However, low level of genetic diversity within the populations may affect their ability to adapt and the possibility of inbreeding depression should be investigated."

It has suffered marked decline because of habitat loss and fragmentation and over-collection, yet an IUCN report on this species does not regard fragmentation as a major threat to the species. We applied 13 nuclear microsatellites and cpDNA sequences to identify the patterns of population structure, genetic diversity and connectivity of six remnant local populations of C. calceolus in highly fragmented Gdask Pomerania region (N Poland). Despite severe (80%) loss of localities in the studied area we found that the local populations retain high levels of clonal (R 0.86-1) and genetic diversity (H-e = 0.572). However, their differentiation is relatively high (F-ST = 0.132 for nuclear SSR and F-ST = 0.363 for cpDNA) despite close geographic proximity (0.6-57km). Bayesian clustering classified populations according to their geographic origin with little admixture. Low genetic connectivity between the remnant populations shows that the current gene flow is too low to serve as a cohesive force in a fragmented habitat, which may impede a quick response to environmental change. The species' ability to retain ancestral variation may help withstand fragmentation, but in the light of observed extirpation rate it should be rather considered as a factor that only delays local populations' extinction. This leads to the conclusion that habitat loss and fragmentation should be regarded as a real threat to stability of C. calcelolus populations."

The D. maculata group consisted of two distinct subgroups, one containing autotetraploid D. maculata subsp. maculata and the other containing diploid D. maculata subsp. fuchsii. Allotetraploids showed a high degree of additivity for the putative parental genomes, and relationships among them were partly correlated to morphologically based entities, but also to geographic distribution. Thus, allotetraploid taxa from the British Isles clustered together, rather than with morphologically similar plants from other areas."

To reveal the genetic structure of arctic-alpine plants near the southern edge of their range in East Asia, 159 samples of Diapensia lapponica subsp. obovata (Diapensiaceae) were collected from 22 populations in Japan. Based on 1,134 bp of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), we determined 10 haplotypes. Neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis, including D. lapponica from Sweden and Schizocodon soldanelloides, revealed that all haplotypes in Japan were monophyletic. Genetic differentiation between populations of central Honshu and northern Japan was strongly supported by the NJ tree (100%), analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA, 68%), and Monmonier's algorithm (>95%). The most ancestral haplotype rarely occurred in Japan, which implied that the extant genetic structure was not caused by genetic divergence during colonization. Thus, these results suggest that the arctic-alpine plant D. lapponica subsp. obovata survived climatic oscillations in central Honshu. This finding supports the hypothesis that high mountains in temperate regions were important for survival of arctic-alpine plants during Quaternary climatic oscillations."

For D. lapponica var. obovata, Sakhalin populations harbored moderate levels of within-population genetic variation and low among-population divergence, whereas extremely low levels of within-population genetic diversity and high among-population differentiation were found in Jeju Island populations. In contrast, we found moderate levels of within-population variation and low among-population differentiation in E. nigrum var. japonicum in both northern populations (those of Sakhalin and an additional population from northern Japan) and Jeju Island populations. Under a similar scenario of immigration history of arctic-alpine plants on Jeju Island during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene and local persistence through glacial/interglacial cycles, the contrasting genetic structure between D. lapponica var. obovata and E. nigrum var. japonicum is mainly attributable to their different life-history, ecological, and demographic traits: (1) hermaphroditic versus monoecious, dioecious or polygamous, (2) seeds with no adaptations for long-distance dispersal versus berry-like drupes dispersed by animals and birds, and (3) a very small patch near the peak of Mt. Halla with a few hundred individuals versus a relatively continuous distribution around the peak of Mt. Halla with numerous individuals. From a conservation perspective, in situ and ex situ conservation measures should be strengthened for D. lapponica var. obovata on Jeju Island given their extreme rarity there."

Here, we test whether this hypothesis is consistent with the biogeographical history of the arctic-alpine genus Diapensia, which shows a disjunction between the Arctic and the Himalayan-Hengduan Mountains (HHM). LocationThe Arctic/sub-Arctic and the HHM. Methods: We used the plastid DNA (pDNA) sequences matK and rbcL and seven Ericales fossils to date the origin of Diapensia. Sequences of four pDNA markers and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer from 56 Diapenisa accessions were then used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships and time of divergence among Diapensia species. Results: Diapensia consists of three major clades; two corresponding to the two arctic species, and one containing the two HHM species sampled. Both the pDNA tree and the species tree resolved the amphi-Beringian D. obovata as sister to a clade that included D. lapponica that has an amphi-Atlantic distribution and the HHM clade. The two arctic species were estimated to have originated in the Middle Miocene-Early Pliocene (D. obovata: 8.3Ma, 95% highest posterior probability density (HPD) 4.0-13.5Ma; D. lapponica: 7.1Ma, 95% HPD 4.1-10.0Ma), long before the formation of the modern arctic biome. In contrast, species divergence in the HHM clade was found to be very recent (0.5Ma, 95% HPD 0.2-0.9Ma; Early-Middle Pleistocene). Main conclusionsOur results reject an HHM origin of the arctic Diapensia and rather suggest that the ancestor of the D. lapponica/HHM clade migrated southwards into the HHM. This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that arctic plant lineages have diverse origins in time and space."

Generally, noncoding regions tend to evolve faster than coding sequences and have recently been applied to the study of phylogenetic relationships among closely related taxa. An implicit assumption of many of these studies is that intraspecific cpDNA variation is either absent or low and therefore will not interfere with the reconstruction of interspecific relationships. A survey of cpDNA sequence variation in the common alpine plant species Draba aizoides L. was undertaken to assess levels of intraspecific cpDNA sequence variation. These levels were compared to levels of interspecific sequence divergence between D. aizoides and related alpine Draba species. Intraspecific cpDNA sequence divergence was extensive in D. aizoides, and intraspecific differences were often larger than interspecific differences. cpDNA haplotype relationships were explored using a maximum parsimony approach and minimum- spanning networks. Results from both methods were largely congruent but comparisons provided interesting insights into the presumed evolutionary history of cpDNA haplotypes.  combined effect of cpDNA introgression and complex lineage sorting was inferred to explain the pattern of cpDNA variation found in D. aizoides. Our results suggest that intraspecific cpDNA variation can be extensive and that intraspecific variation needs to be taken into account when inferring phylogenetic relationships among closely related taxa."

It occurs exclusively at elevations between 2600 and 3000 m and is restricted to less than a dozen mountains in the Lower Engadin. Morphological characters and polyploidy suggest a hybrid origin. Potential diploid progenitor species are distributed widely and often occur sympatrically. To study the evolutionary history of D. ladina we assessed intra- and interspecific sequence variation at noncoding chloroplast DNA loci and nuclear rDNA ITS sequences in D. ladina and its presumed progenitor species D. aizoides, D. dubia, and D. tomentosa. A single ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) genotype was found in each of D. aizoides and D. dubia and two in D. tomentosa. Additivity of ITS sequences of D. aizoides and D. tomentosa was found in D. ladina, supporting the hypothesis of an allotetraploid origin. Intraspecific cpDNA variation was found in all diploid species, but not in D. ladina. The single chloroplast DNA haplotype found in the latter was closest to one cpDNA haplotype found in D. tomentosa, suggesting that D. tomentosa was the maternal parent. These results suggest that D. ladina is a relatively young, presumably postglacial, taxon with a single allopolyploid origin."

Recently, the conservation value of relict populations has been emphasized, since they are adapted to stressful ecological conditions, which may be important for future distribution range shifts due to climate change. However, glacial relict populations have strongly been affected by historical fragmentation processes. Limited genetic variation and reduced reproduction can, therefore, be postulated for glacial relict populations. In our study we tested these assumptions. We investigated central European populations of the typical rock plant Draba aizoides from the Alps (considered as a core distribution area) and from the Swabian Alb, the Southern and Northern Franconian Jura (where its populations are considered glacial relict populations). We analysed genetic variation using molecular markers AFLPs and studied the reproduction of the populations in germination experiments. Glacial relict populations were genetically less variable and strongly differentiated, but they exhibited higher germination than populations from the Alps. From our results it can be concluded that glacial relict populations may have limited genetic variation, but they do not necessarily exhibit a limited reproductive capacity. Glacial relict populations are, therefore, vital survivors of the Pleistocene, which deserve full conservation attention, especially against the background of future climate change."

They were examined cytologically and by isoenzyme analysis. Testing of 204 individuals from 12 sites resulted in genetic identities I = 1.00 between populations within the taxa, and average heterozygosities H(m) of 18.8-37.5%. This was explained by selfpollination, vegetative reproduction, colonization of low competition ecological niches, and high plasticity of the phenotypes of all taxa. The speciation of D. anglica originates from a hybrid with D. rotundifolia as one parent. D. x obovata, the hybrid D. anglica x D. rotundifolia, stands isoenzymatically between both parents. D. intermedia is clearly separated from the other three taxa. Some loci of D. intermedia and D. rotundifolia possibly show fixed heterozygosity and indicate a chromosome number of x = 5 for the genus Drosera. A comparison of the four taxa with two individuals of D. adelae (section Arachnopus Planch.) showed that both sections are probably well differentiated from each other. Subalpine dwarfed forms of D. anglica and D. rotundifolia are genetically indistinguishable from normal forms. Because of their lack for genetic adaption, the Swiss Drosera taxa depend on the unchanging conservation of peatland biotopes."

However AFLP data indicate that this outbreeding species complex possesses a gene pool distinct from that of the widespread inbreeding tetraploids. The widespread and endemic inbreeding tetraploids contain examples of morphologically and genetically definable taxa, but also species whose distinctness is more equivocal. The conservation implications of this study are that species-based action plans are potentially suitable for conservation of the diploid endemics E. vigursii and E. rivularis. In contrast we contend that a species-based conservation framework, developed with reproductively isolated and genetically distinct groups in mind, requires modification for conservation of the complex and dynamic diversity found within the tetraploids. The adoption of ‘taxonomic’ action plans, designed to protect the evolutionary processes generating Euphrasia diversity, may provide a supplementary solution for conserving this type of variation."

RAPD pattern was established using four appropriate random primers and this RAPD pattern appeared to be characteristic for the four Gagea species.

Among the investigated Gagea species there is a clear difference in the number found in the study area, in habitat requirements, in the potential for colonization of new habitats and also in their genetic variability. G. villosa and G. lutea represent large populations with a high level of genetic polymorphism (78,8% and 71,4%) among populations. The level of polymorphism within the investigated populations was 37% to 60% for G. viliosa and 16% to 48% for G. lutea. Previously in Saxony-Anhalt there were large populations of G. villosa in arable land, but as a result of the intensification of agriculture there has been a decrease in the number of populations. Other populations of this species have been successful in occupying new habitats with a high level of genetic variability of those populations. In contrast G, bohemica subsp, saxatilis occurred in low numbers for a long time in isolated populations which has lead to a loss of genetic variability. Within the populations only 2,5% to 6,2% polymorphic RAPD markers was found. The level of polymorphism among the G. bohemica populations was however 39,6%. The small populations of G. bohemica subsp. saxatilis have little genetic variation and should be protected."

The amount of genic variation (number of different alleles and average heterozygosity) appears uniform in diploids and polyploids.

Did these cold-adapted species invade much of the continental steppe or did they remain restricted to warmer slopes of inner mountain massifs? To examine this question, we investigated the phylogeography of Gentiana nivalis, a typical European arctic-alpine plant species. Genome fingerprinting analyses revealed that four genetic pools are actually unevenly distributed across the continent. One cluster covers almost all mountain massifs as well as northern areas, and thus coincides with a scenario of past distribution covering a large part of the European glacial steppe. In contrast, the three other lineages are strongly restricted spatially to western, central, and eastern Alps, respectively, thus arguing towards a scenario of in situ glacial survival. The coexistence of lineages with such contrasting demographic histories in Europe challenges our classical view of refugia and corroborates several hypotheses of biogeographers from the twentieth century."

Yet, understanding how environmental forces give rise to adaptive genetic variation is a challenge in conservation genetics and crucial to the preservation of species under rapidly changing climatic conditions. Environmental variation, phylogeographic history, and population demographic processes all contribute to spatially structured genetic variation, however few current models attempt to separate these confounding effects. To illustrate the benefits of using a spatially-explicit model for identifying potentially adaptive loci, we compared outlier locus detection methods with a recently-developed landscape genetic approach. We analyzed 157 loci from samples of the alpine herb Gentiana nivalis collected across the European Alps. Principle coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM), eigenvectors that quantify multi-scale spatial variation present in a data set, were incorporated into a landscape genetic approach relating AFLP frequencies with 23 environmental variables. Four major findings emerged. 1) Fifteen loci were significantly correlated with at least one predictor variable (R (adj) (2) > 0.5). 2) Models including PCNM variables identified eight more potentially adaptive loci than models run without spatial variables. 3) When compared to outlier detection methods, the landscape genetic approach detected four of the same loci plus 11 additional loci. 4) Temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation were the three major environmental factors driving potentially adaptive genetic variation in G. nivalis. Techniques presented in this paper offer an efficient method for identifying potentially adaptive genetic variation and associated environmental forces of selection, providing an important step forward for the conservation of non-model species under global change."

 This study aims to link demographic traits and post-glacial
 recolonization processes with genetic traits in Himantoglossum hircinum
 (L.) Spreng (Orchidaceae), and to test the implications of the
 central-marginal concept (CMC) in Europe.
 Location
 Twenty sites covering the entire European distribution range of this
 species.
 Methods
 We employed amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and
 performed a plastid microsatellite survey to assess genetic variation
 in 20 populations of H. hircinum located along central-marginal
 gradients. We measured demographic traits to assess population fitness
 along geographical gradients and to test for correlations between
 demographic traits and genetic diversity. We used genetic diversity
 indices and analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) to test hypotheses
 of reduced genetic diversity and increased genetic differentiation and
 isolation from central to peripheral sites. We used Bayesian
 simulations to analyse genetic relationships among populations.
 Results
 Genetic diversity decreased significantly with increasing latitudinal
 and longitudinal distance from the distribution centre when excluding
 outlying populations. The AMOVA revealed significant genetic
 differentiation among populations (F-ST = 0.146) and an increase in
 genetic differentiation from the centre of the geographical range to
 the margins (except for the Atlantic group). Population fitness,
 expressed as the ratio N-R/N, decreased significantly with increasing
 latitudinal distance from the distribution centre. Flower production
 was lower in most eastern peripheral sites. The geographical
 distribution of microsatellite haplotypes suggests post-glacial range
 expansion along three major migratory pathways, as also supported by
 individual membership fractions in six ancestral genetic clusters
 (C1-C6). No correlations between genetic diversity (e.g. diversity
 indices, haplotype frequency) and population demographic traits were
 detected.
 Main conclusions
 Reduced genetic diversity and haplotype frequency in H. hircinum at
 marginal sites reflect historical range expansions. Spatial variation
 in demographic traits could not explain genetic diversity patterns. For
 those sites that did not fit into the CMC, the genetic pattern is
 probably masked by other factors directly affecting either demography
 or population genetic structure. These include post-glacial
 recolonization patterns and changes in habitat suitability due to
 climate change at the northern periphery. Our findings emphasize the
 importance of distinguishing historical effects from those caused by
 geographical variation in population demography of species when
 studying evolutionary and ecological processes at the range margins
 under global change."

We test assumptions of concepts on geographic population structure (e.g. central-marginal concept and 'rear edge versus leading edge' model) that could be used to inform conservation of plant species under climatic changes. We analyze a comprehensive dataset of demographic traits (e.g. population size, flowering, delta C-13 of plant leaves) of up to 32 sites of Himantoglossum hircinum (L) Spreng. (Orchidaceae) located within six sub-regions of its European distribution range. Soil and climate parameters are employed as environmental predictors of variation in measured population traits. Climate is the main driver of demographic variability overriding central-marginal gradients that might be present. Warming of the climate at high latitudes paves the way for northward range expansion of species. Populations at the north and north-eastern range peripheries partly show exponential population growth and high genetic diversity and are likely to be the source of immigrants for colonization of newly suitable habitats as the climate continues to change. In recent times, populations at the southern range periphery have suffered from intensification of land use and decreasing rainfall, but in the case of Southern Italy are important because they contain genetically unique traits. Populations at both, 'leading' and 'rear', edges ought to be at the focus of conservation planning. Different conservation strategies are proposed at opposing species borders taking into account spatial variation in population needs on a geographic scale, projected population response to expected environmental changes and genetic characteristics."

Morphometric comparison of the two largest and best-known populations in southern England - the coastal dune population at Sandwich and the chalk grassland population at Newmarket - using 46 characters showed that they differ only subtly, the Sandwich plants being on average more vegetatively robust and slightly more darkly pigmented, but possessing less extensive lip-spots and substantially longer 'arms'. A comparatively morphologically divergent semi-desert population from Ifrane, Morocco differs from the English populations in having broader stems, less recurved 'arms', a more strongly down-curved spur and in lacking near-circular spots within the sepals. Molecular comparison of 46 plants, representing 13 English populations and 18 populations from Continental Europe and Morocco, revealed only subtle distinctions in the high-copy nuclear region ITS, and smaller-scale comparisons of the low-copy nuclear (LEAFY) and plastid (four intron) regions proved to be even less discriminatory. These results reinforce prior morphological inferences that H. hircinum is a cohesive species. Scanning electron microscopy elucidated the ontogeny of these remarkable flowers, suggesting that the exceptionally elongate central labellar lobe originated by accelerated heterochronic growth and showing that the characteristic spiral torsion always runs counter-clockwise. Lateral fusion of the paired viscidia is convergent with several other lineages of subtribe Orchidinae. Review of pollination and life-history features of H. hircinum suggest that they are typical of food-deceptive species within Orchidinae. The Lizard Orchid is infamous for geographic mobility; its cycles of expansion and contraction through the last century have been interpreted as reflecting a net northward migration in response to recent climate change. Our data tentatively suggest relatively recent colonisation of Morocco at high altitudes and an overall northwestward direction of migration into the UK. ITS ribotypes indicate multiple immigration events leading to levels of genetic diversity in England comparable with those on the Continent. A non-recent origin is inferred for H. hircinum which, despite recent systematic revisions, may harbour further cryptic species; the taxonomic status of supposed outlying populations in southern Italy in particular is questioned by the present genetic data."

The two grasses split in the Quaternary about two million years ago. Hordeum marinum and the diploid of Hordeum gussoneanum (2x) co-occur throughout the Mediterranean basin, while the autotetraploid cytotype of H. gussoneanum (4x) overlaps with its diploid progenitor geographically only in the utmost Eastern Mediterranean, extending from there eastwards into Asia. Using chloroplast sequences of the trn L-F region, six newly developed chloroplast microsatellite loci, ecological predictive models based on climate data, and the present geographical distribution of the two species we analysed differentiation processes in the H. marinum group. The chloroplast data indicated clear differences in the history of both species. For H. marinum we found a subdivision between genetically variable populations from the Iberian Peninsula and the more uniform populations from the remaining Mediterranean. As an explanation, we assume Pleistocene fragmentation of an earlier widespread population and survival in an Iberian and a Central Mediterranean glacial refuge. Chloroplast variation was completely absent within the cytotypes of H. gussoneanum, indicating a severe and recent genetic bottleneck. Due to this lack of chloroplast variation only the combination of ecological habitat modelling with molecular data analyses allowed conclusions about the history of this taxon. The distribution areas of the two cytotypes of H. gussoneanum overlap today in parts of Turkey, indicating an area with similar climate conditions during polyploid formation. However, after its origin the polyploid cytotype underwent a pronounced ecological shift, compared to its diploid progenitor, allowing it to colonize mountainous inland habitats between the Mediterranean basin and Afghanistan. The extant sympatric occurrence of H. marinum and H. gussoneanum 2x in the Mediterranean region is interpreted as a result of secondary contact after fast Holocene range expansion out of different ice age refugia."

The patterns of PCRproducts of CD primer-pairs after digestion with TaqI were the same for three subspecies of H. perforatum L. but different for other investigated species. The cluster analysis demonstrated high species specifity of the cpDNA structure. Conclusion: Considerable degree of interspecific polymorphism was detected in both restriction profiles, while intraspecific pattern was identical even between H. perforatum subspecies. The described method of cpDNA analysis appears applicable in interspecific phylogenetical investigation for a linkage study, i.e. of the relationship between Hypericum perforatum L. and Hypericum maculatum Crantz, as well as for intraspecific biogeographic investigation in genus Hypericum."

 To analyse phylogeographic patterns in the four species of Hypochaeris
 sect. Hypochaeris, evaluating possible areas of origin and the
 microevolutionary processes that have shaped their morphology, genetics
 and distribution.
 Location
 Western Mediterranean area.
 Methods
 We applied amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to a
 total of 494 individuals belonging to 82 populations of Hypochaeris
 arachnoidea, H. glabra, H. radicata and H. salzmanniana to determine
 population structure.
 Results
 Populations with the largest proportion of private and rare AFLP
 fragments were found in Morocco. This region was consequently inferred
 to be the ancestral area for H. arachnoidea, H. glabra, H. radicata and
 H. salzmanniana. The Guadalquivir River (southern Spain) was inferred
 to be an effective dispersal barrier for H. glabra and H. radicata. The
 Strait of Gibraltar was inferred to be a somewhat weaker barrier than
 the Guadalquivir River for H. radicata and a much weaker barrier for H.
 glabra. The main barrier for H. salzmanniana coincides with the
 extension of the Rif Mountains to the Atlantic coast in Morocco, and
 the Strait of Gibraltar is a much weaker barrier for this species.
 Hypochaeris arachnoidea appears to have originated in the Atlas
 Mountains.
 Main conclusions
 The highest levels of genetic variation in La Mamora forest (H. glabra
 and H. salzmanniana) or the adjacent central Middle Atlas (H.
 arachnoidea and H. radicata) in Morocco suggest that these areas were a
 centre of origin of Hypochaeris sect. Hypochaeris. All three potential
 barriers-the Guadalquivir River, the Strait of Gibraltar, and the Rif
 Mountains-have been important in shaping genetic diversity in species
 of section Hypochaeris."

A dynamic intensification of processes of crop production is considered one of the major reasons for shrinking of occurrence acreage and population number, or even extinction of numerous species with narrow ecological niche and high sensitivity to herbicides. These unfavourable transformations contribute to the gene pool restriction and necessity of species conservation. A representative of that group of plants is Illecebrum verticillatum (Caryophyllaceae) - a rare species endangered due to extinction in many European countries. Results of a study on decline of communities with Illecebrum verticillatum at the most north-eastward sites in the Kaluszyn Upland (Podlasie Lowland, Eastern Poland) are presented. Observations were made on permanent plots for three periods (I - the years 1994-1997, period II - the years 2002-2004 and period III - the years 2008-2010) over the last 17 years. The material studied consisted of 136 phytosociological releves made by Braun-Blanquet method. Changes in phytocenoses with Illecebrum verticillatum were analysed and the habitat factors responsible for regression of these phytocenoses were identified. The degree of endangering of Illecebrum verticillatum in the area studied was evaluated on the basis of the frequency of occurrence, population abundance and genetic variation at the level of storage proteins in seeds by the modified SDS-PAGE method. Comparison of phytocenoses from different periods revealed a number of qualitative and quantitative differences. The number of sites of occurrence as well as population abundance of Illecebrum verticillatum have drastically decreased. Changes in the contribution of indicatory species (according to Ellenberg) were noted. In periods II and III a decrease in the contribution of hygrophilous and acidophilous species and an increase in that of nitrophilous species was observed. Significant changes in the structure of communities were confirmed by the calculated similarity indices (the most pronounced differences were observed between periods I and III). The phytocenoses were transformed towards degraded floristic composition, manifested by a decrease in the number of species in a plot, decrease in species diversity and increase in the index of domination. A significant increase in pH and nitrogen content at the habitats studied was noted. The phytocenoses reveal a replacement of nitrophilous for the eurytopic species. The factors having the strongest restricting effect on the occurrence of communities with Illecebrum verticillatum in the areas studied include: changes in the structure of agricultural use of land, increase in the contribution of maize in the structure of crops and intensification of production. At present 6 sites with Illecebrum verticillatum remain in the study area about 260 km(2) (Kaluszyn Upland, Central-eastern Poland). Electrophoretic analysis of storage proteins in seeds of this species from these sites has shown high genetic similarity of these populations, irrespective of the distances between them (0-19% diversity among six the remaining populations). The diminished genetic pool of Illecebrum verticillatum population in this area indicates a need for the protection of this species."

Specimens of this species from Sardinian temporary wetlands showed the sympatric presence of two kinds of individuals with correlated variation in size, ornamentation, and radial ridges of megaspores, and in ornamentation of microspores. However, they showed the same diploid chromosome number (2n =20), ITS ribotype, and macromorphological feature. No intermediate individuals, showing mixed characters of each spore types as well as malformed or aborted spores have been detected. These results suggest that the gene flow between both kinds of I.. histrix plants is heavily restricted, if not limited at all. On the basis of the cytogenetic and molecular uniformity detected in I. histrix in this study, genomic incompatibilities do not seem to be the main reasons involved in the maintenance of the two kinds of I. histrix individuals. Prezygotic barriers involving changes in phenology (e.g. spore maturation) or differential gamete dispersal should be further assessed to gain insights in this topic. The presence of two kinds of individuals in I. histrix differing in significant spore features used in quillwort taxonomy, whatsoever the causes involved in its origin, could be the basis of an incipient differentiation process upon which selective pressures could ultimately lead to speciation."

The length (mm) and weight (mg) of achenes formed on L. sativa, L. saligna and their F, hybrids were 4.01, 1.04; 2.70, 0.35; and 4.41 mm, 1.33 mg, respectively, and those of achenes obtained from L. saligna X L. sativa was 2.51 mm and 0.29 mg. The size of achenes obtained on the F, hybrids ranged from 3.3 to 6.2 mm and 0.2 to 2.4 mg. The size of the F2 triploid seeds from the F, hybrids were classified into 2 groups; 5 triploids with small achene (0.7- 1.1 mg) and the remaining 6 triploids with even heavier achene than L. sativa (>1.8 mg). The phenotype of 5 isozyme loci studied, Got-1, Pgi-1, Pgi-2, Pdh-1, and Pdh-2, always showed the 4 : 4 : 1 in band intensity in the triploids, which enabled us to analyze the genotypes. When the gene of L. sativa was named 'l' and that of L. saligna, 'g', all triploids were always heterozygous in the 5 isozyme loci, ggl or gll; this suggests that triploids resulted from a union of a reduced gamete with an unreduced gamete. The triploids from small achenes were ggl in almost all of the five loci, whereas those from the large achenes were gll. Thus, the curious combinations between achene size and the genotypes indicate that the survival rate of individuals with the distorted combination of genes to one of the two parent species is higher than that with the random combination."

This yielded 28 primer sets amplifying unambiguously scorable products, of which 26 showed polymorphisms in a test set of six lettuce varieties.

Variation for these markers were assessed in germplasm including accessions of cultivated lettuce, Lactuca sativa L. and three wild Lactuca spp., L. serriola L., L. saligna and L. virosa L. Diversity was also studied within and between natural populations of L. serriola from Israel and California; the former is close to the center of diversity for Lactuca spp. while the latter is an area of more recent colonization. Large numbers of haplotypes were detected indicating the presence of numerous resistance genes in wild species. The diversity in haplotypes provided evidence for gene duplication and unequal crossing-over during the evolution of this cluster of resistance genes. However, there was no evidence for duplications and deletions within the LRR-encoding regions studied. The three markers were highly correlated with resistance phenotypes in L. sativa. They were able to discriminate between accessions that had previously been shown to be resistant to all known isolates of Bremia lactucae. Therefore, these markers will be highly informative for the establishment of core collections and marker-aided selection.  hierarchical analysis of the population structure of L. serriola showed that countries, as well as locations, were significantly differentiated.

We studied the population structure of three predominantly self-pollinating wild Lactuca species (Lactuca serriola, L. saligna, and L. aculeata). Seeds for this study were collected from individual plants in northern Israel, along a line transect, and two populations per each Lactuca species. The distance between neighboring plants sampled for seeds varied from 1.5 to 37 m. The transect length at single sites ranged from 47.2 to 151.8 m. The taxonomic status of 67 individual plants was morphologically validated during greenhouse multiplication. Both genetic structure and diversity were analyzed by using 11 EST-SSR loci and 230 AFLP markers. Relatively low genetic diversity values were observed, increasing in the following order: L. aculeata < L. serriola < L. saligna. Network analysis clearly separated samples according to their taxonomic determination; also reflecting the gene diversity as well as the genetic distance values among the three species. Nevertheless, given the predominantly selfing character of these species, populations were not uniform (genetically and morphologically). It seems that overall genetic variation in a population increases at its periphery, due to the presence of plants with "non-indigenous" alleles, which are most likely coming from migration and subsequent interpopulation or interspecific hybridization. Mantel tests generally indicated a positive association between genetic distance and micro-geographical distance of a particular population, primarily due to the "outlier" samples collected at a population's periphery."

The smaller populations showed lower flowering and seed production percentages, but sexual reproduction does take place in all populations and the seed produced is viable. The smaller populations had lower levels of allozyme variation, but variability was present in all populations except one small, isolated one in North America. There was significant genetic differentiation among the populations, particularly between those from Wales and the Alps and between the two Welsh populations studied. Analysis of RAPD variation in four, small Welsh populations provided further evidence of this differentiation.

Relationships between reproductive strategies and genetic variation were investigated in a number of populations, representing a wide habitat, geographic and population size range. In all populations, vegetative reproduction predominates over sexual reproduction, but seed produced is viable and germinates readily under controlled conditions. Smaller, peripheral populations produced fewer flowers and seeds than the larger ones, but all populations studied supported significant percentages (> 30%) of male plants, due to either the occurrence of androdioecy in this species or to a resource limited breeding system. Analysis of allozyme variation in sixteen populations from North America, the European Alps and Wales showed lower levels of genetic variation in smaller populations which averaged 1.1-1.2 alleles per locus and 10-20% of loci polymorphic, whereas larger populations averaged 1.4 alleles per locus and 30-40% polymorphic loci. This applied especially to the most northerly and southerly populations in North America, suggesting the occurrence of genetic drift in these small, peripheral populations. F-statistics suggest relatively high levels of differentiation among smaller populations, even among those closely related geographically, but genetic variation has been retained in all but one population, possibly due to infrequent sexual reproduction by long lived clones. RAPD analysis of four small populations in Wales provided further evidence of clonal growth and possible inbreeding dominating a mixed mating reproductive system with consequent genetic structuring in these populations."

Two subspecies of Gagea bohemica: G. bohemica subsp. saxatilis and G.bohemica subsp. bohemica are characterized by trnL-trnF data and morphological features. Analysis of the ITS region shows that G. pomeranica represents a hybrid of G. pratensis and G. lutea. Lloydia serotina was initially used as an outgroup species, but it was placed within the investigated Gagea species in the psbA-trnH and the trnL- trnF phylogenetic tree."

Lobelia urens is rare in Britain and occurs in only six widely separated populations. The distribution of genetic variation within and among these populations was examined using enzyme electrophoresis. The results showed that much of the variation was held among populations (GsT = 0.265) and that gene flow among populations was low. The populations therefore require conservation as independent units. No link was found between geographical distance and genetic distance, adding weight to the theory that the British populations were established independently. Evidence was found that the smaller, unmanaged, populations contained less variation, although all had passed through a series of bottlenecks during the past 50 years. As surrounding vegetation becomes more dense, fewer individuals contribute to variation in population size and it is suggested that periodic disturbance should be used as a management tool in order to release variation accumulated in the seed bank and so prevent depletion of genetic diversity."

Genetic diversity and distances were calculated using Nei's analysis, and cluster analysis was performed. These results indicated the occurrence of seed migration among the fields and a high genetic diversity of darnel in this region. Crop seed exchange and contamination of crop seeds with darnel seeds lead to the unintended artifical gene flow of darnel. Because darnel seeds and seedlings resemble their associated crop seeds and seedlings, traditional methods of crop cultivation have the unintended consequence of conserving the genetic diversity of darnel."

Nei's gene diversity (h) and the coefficient of gene differentiation (G(st)) were calculated. The results from microsatellite analysis indicated that accessions from the same country did not always cluster together, probably because of the limited number of loci used. In contrast, AFLP clearly separated clusters between countries and/or regions; Pakistan-Nepal complex, the Mediterranean region, Ethiopia and Japan. The h value was much higher for microsatellite than for AFLP analysis, indicating that microsatellites are the more variable markers. For AFLP analyses, h values were highest in accessions from Pakistan-Nepal complex, and from the Mediterranean region. These are in agreement with proposals that the origin of L. temulentum lies between the Southwestern Asia and the Mediterranean basin. The clear groupings of accessions from each country and/or region with high Gst (0.688) indicate that exchange of seeds between them is limited."

There was no or only a weak correlation between population size and genetic diversity. The wind-pollinated, outcrossing species F. ovina had the highest levels of genetic variation, intermediate levels were found in the largely outcrossing and insect pollinated L. viscaria, while lowest levels of variation were found in the inbreeding A. thaliana. Relative to their breeding systems and the small geographical scale of the study all species exhibited remarkably high levels of total genetic variation. In the outbreeding species most of the genetic variation was found within populations (F. ovina: F-ST=0.059 and L. viscaria: F- ST=0.092). No geographic pattern was found between populations in the outbreeding species, indicating high levels of gene flow. The cereal fields separating the populations may function as conduits rather than barriers to pollen dispersed by wind, and pollinating insects (bumblebees and butterflies) may have no problems moving between patches at this scale, thus alleviating the danger of genetic erosion associated with small population size. In contrast, the fields appear to be efficient barriers to gene flow by seed dispersal. In the inbreeding Arabis thaliana a geographic pattern was evident. Most of the variation in this species was found between populations (F-ST = 0.722) indicating low levels of gene flow; single populations exhibited large variation in the number of genotypes present (1 to 15)."

We aimed to investigate the overall level of genetic diversity its spatial distribution, and possible differences between peripheral and central populations by examining several populations with electrophoresis. Our results showed that the level of genetic diversity varied substantially among populations (H-exp = 0.000-0.116) and that the total level of genetic diversity (mean H-exp = 0.056) was low compared to that of other species with similar life-history attributes. The peripheral populations oft. viscaria had less genetic variation (mean H-exp = 0.034) than the central ones (0.114). Analysis of genetic structure suggested limited gene flow (mean F-ST = 0.430) and high differentiation among populations emphasizing the role of genetic drift (N(e)m = 0.33). Isolation was even higher than expected based on the physical distance among populations. We also focused on the association between population size and genetic diversity and possible effects on fitness of these factors. Population size was positively correlated with genetic diversity. Population size and genetic diversity, however, were not associated with fitness components such as germination rate, seedling mass or seed yield. There were no differences in the measured fitness components between peripheral and central populations.

Because extinctions can be attributed broadly to these factors, fluctuating asymmetry may provide a sensitive tool for detecting such stresses. We studied the level of fluctuating asymmetry of flowers of a perennial outcrossing plant species, Lychnis viscaria, both in natural and common-garden populations. The degree of flower asymmetry was higher in small, isolated, and marginal populations of the species range. These marginal populations also were the most homozygous. In the core area of the species' range, flowers were more symmetrical. The level of asymmetry was correlated with both population size and heterozygosity. However, a partial correlation analysis revealed that when the impact of population size was controlled for, there was a negative relationship between fluctuating asymmetry and heterozygosity, whereas when controlling for heterozygosity, no relationship between population size and fluctuating asymmetry was found. This indicates that genetic consequences of small population size probably underlie the relationship between the level of asymmetry and population size. Results from a transplantation experiment showed that individuals subjected to a higher environmental stress had an increased level of asymmetry compared to control plants. In the common-garden conditions the level of fluctuating asymmetry did not differ between the central and marginal populations. This suggests that presumably both genetic and environmental factors affected to the higher level of asymmetry among marginal populations compared to central ones. In all, we conclude that even though fluctuating asymmetry seems to be a sensitive tool for detecting stresses, results from studies focusing on only one factor should be interpreted with caution."

As expected, the population with a low level of isozyme variation expressed the least inbreeding depression for seed germination. Highest inbreeding depression for germination was found in the largest and genetically most variable population. No clear differences between populations in expression of inbreeding depression in the later life stages were found. The population level inbreeding depression varied with the nutrient conditions and among populations and life stages, but we found no evidence that inbreeding depression increased with lower nutrient availability.

To study the colonisation process, we analysed the clonal organisation and population structure of Maianthemum bifolium populations in a number of forest fragments using AFLP. A total of 129 genets were identified. Most (41/53) patches of M. bifolium in recent (less than 80 years old) and old (at least 175 years of age) parts of the woodlands contained single genets. Only one of the 12 patches with multiple genotypes showed intermingled growth. Besides seed dispersal also dispersal of vegetative material contributed to colonisation since five genotypes were found in more than one patch, with patches up to 51 m apart. Population differentiation between populations in different forests was significant (F-ST=0.10) and indicated low gene flow. This level of differentiation was already found between populations in different parts of the same forest, just over 200 m apart. In fact, only two adjacent populations were not significantly differentiated, one population located in old forest whereas the other was established next to it on a former pasture re-forested after 1916. Limited gene flow is also consistent with the decrease of genetic similarities with physical distance, which relationship is highly significant but only for distances up to 400 m."

Although theory predicts an impact of clonal growth on both- within- and between population genetic structure, most empirical evidence available to date does not reveal sharp differences between sexually reproducing and clonal species. This has been attributed mainly to the fact that even low levels of sexual recruitment can maintain high levels of genetic diversity. Here we study the effects of prolonged clonal growth and very low rates of sexual recruitment on the genetic structure of the perennial Maianthemum bifolium, an outcrossing understorey species of temperate forests. Average genotypic diversity (0.37) of the populations, as revealed by AFLP, was above the average values reported for species of similar characteristics, but some populations were extremely poor in genotypes. Fruiting success was positively correlated with genotypic diversity, probably as a result of shortage in mating types and compatible pollen in populations poor in genotypes. This was confirmed by a pollination experiment. Fruiting success increased by a factor three when individuals were hand-pollinated with pollen from a nearby population compared to hand-pollinations with pollen from the own population. Furthermore, the fruiting success after natural pollination (control individuals) was positively related to number of nearby populations which could act as pollen sources. Given the limited colonization capacity of the species (no seed flow), and the long time since fragmentation of the forest fragments studied, between-population genetic differentiation was relatively low (Phi(st)=0.14). Lack of genetic drift due to long generation times and very limited sexual recruitment is probably responsible for this. Our results show that prolonged clonal growth and lack of sexual recruitment may affect within- and between- population genetic structure and the capability for sexual reproduction."

For this purpose, plants were examined in various populations in forests in the Lower Unstrut valley (Saxony-Anhalt and neighbouring Thuringia, Germany). One patch (0.65 m x 0.42 m) from a larger stand in the Ziegelrodaer Forst was dug out and mapped in detail, recording the position and state of all modules and spacers. A careful examination of the spacers revealed breaking and rotting zones, indicating regular clonal reproduction. By morpho-ecological analyses alone, however, only merigenets with disrupted spacers between modules could be assigned to specific genets. Therefore, clonal reproduction within the patch was further assessed with the AFLP-method, using the generated fingerprints to identify genets and their clonal units (merigenets). The obtained molecular data did not only verify the morphological results, but, moreover, revealed a much higher number of merigenets of the same genet: Within the population in the Ziegelrodaer Forst one genet was identified, which was morphologically split into at least 20 merigenets. This genet reached an extension of at least ten meters; indicating the high relevance of clonal growth and clonal reproduction. In M. bifolium, a patch (and, consequently, a stand and population) is generally formed through repeated clonal growth and subsequent clonal reproduction which regularly produce independent, genetically identical offspring (merigenets). These processes lead to "consequent vegetative multiplication", which is of great importance for habitat colonisation and maintenance in M. bifolium as well as in other clonal plants."

To evaluate the genetic consequences of this patchy distribution we compared levels of diversity, inbreeding and differentiation from ten populations from the UK with eight relatively large populations from Sweden and Norway where the species is more continuously distributed. We demonstrate that in both the UK and Scandinavia, the species is highly inbreeding (global F (IS) = 0.899). Levels of population differentiation were high (F'(ST) = 0.892) and significantly higher amongst UK populations (F'(ST) = 0.949) than Scandinavian populations (F'(ST) = 0.762; P < 0.01). The isolated populations in the UK have, on average, lower genetic diversity (allelic richness, proportion of loci that are polymorphic, gene diversity) than Scandinavian populations, and this diversity difference is associated with the smaller census size and population area of UK populations. From a conservation perspective, the naturally inbreeding nature of the species may buffer the species against immediate effects of inbreeding depression, but the markedly lower levels of genetic diversity in UK populations may represent a genetic constraint to evolutionary change. In addition, the high levels of population differentiation suggest that gene flow among populations will not be effective at replenishing lost variation. We thus recommend supporting in situ conservation management with ex situ populations and human-mediated seed dispersal among selected populations in the UK."

 The aim of this study is to analyse the genetic population structure of
 Meum athamanticum Jacq. in order to explore the alternative hypotheses
 (1) that the central and northern highland populations are the result
 of post-glacial recolonization from southern refugia, and the disjunct
 distribution of M. athamanticum can be explained by modern ecological
 conditions, or (2) that extant populations north of the Alps and
 Pyrenees persisted in situ during glacial periods.
 Location
 Europe.
 Methods
 Variation of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) was
 analysed for 23 populations from the entire range of the species. We
 used band-based approaches and methods based on allele frequencies to
 measure genetic diversity and to identify population structure.
 Results
 Our analyses reveal a north-south differentiation within M.
 athamanticum. High levels of genetic diversity, as well as private
 fragments, are found in populations both north and south of the Alps.
 Differentiation among populations is lower in the northern than in the
 southern population group, and significant isolation-by-distance is
 found only in the latter group.
 Main conclusions
 Our results indicate that M. athamanticum survived the last ice age in
 multiple refugia throughout its contemporary range and did not expand
 into areas north of the Alps from southern refugia. We found evidence
 that regional-scale migration in northern, formerly periglacial, parts
 of the species range has resulted in the intermingling of populations.
 In contrast, southern populations are characterized by long-term
 isolation. The south-west Alps represent an area where immigration and
 mixing of populations from northern and southern refugia appears to
 have taken place."

A recent study of Meum athamanticum in its total range of occurrences revealed persistence of this temperate montane plant species in Central Europe north of the Alps, without going into details. We therefore aimed to study differentiation and migration processes of this plant species in more detail throughout Central Europe. We used high resolution amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) markers and analyzed 210 plant individuals of 14 Central European populations with three pairs of primer combinations (128 loci, 111 of which polymorphic). The data show genetic differentiation and varying levels of molecular diversity within populations and groups of populations. Altogether, the studied populations did not show a gradient in molecular variation along presumptive postglacial migration routes across Central Europe. Rather, they reveal a genetic division into seven major groups. Four of them are characterised by high genetic diversity, private fragments and higher than average number of rare and sparse fragments, leading to the assumption that they are descendants of independent populations which survived in glacial refugia. In combination with information from paleoclimate and paleovegetation, it is likely that microclimatically favoured habitats at (i) the eastern flank of the Black Forest, (ii) the southern margin of the Cologne basin, (iii) the foothills of the Erzgebirge, and (iv) the foothills of the Jura Mountains acted as sources for the postglacial recolonisation of this species to the other mountains of Central Europe. As some of the populations analysed show intermixed gene-pools (i.e. including genetic information from different groups) and partly have exceptionally high genetic diversity, but no private and only relatively few rare or sparse fragments, they might represent contact zones. On the other hand, genetic pauperization and isolation of two other populations in connection with extremely small population sizes and unfavourable habitat conditions seem to reflect recent bottlenecks. Consequently, the genetic structure of M. athamanticum in Central Europe is shaped by (i) extra-Mediterranean glacial refugia in situ, (ii) following postglacial hybridization along emerging contact zones and (iii) genetic bottlenecks in thereafter isolated small populations. All results provide evidences for small scale migration of the species between Central European valleys and surrounding highlands. Therefore, our study provides molecular evidence for both climate dependent wide ranging periglacial tabula rasa, but some small refugia in locally buffered areas. We hereby show that the environmental heterogeneity of cold stage landscapes in Central Europe is generally underestimated."

In the two sexual diploids, M. biflora and M. rubella, genetic diversity was as high in populations from Svalbard as in populations from more southerly latitudes. In M. biflora, eight out of 15 loci were polymorphic (P=53.3 %); in M. rubella eight out of 18 (P=44.4 %). The mean number of alleles per locus (A) and the number of multilocus genotypes (MG) were also higher in M. biflora than in M. rubella, A=1.60 and MG=21 vs. A=1.44 and MG=9. The proportion of genetic diversity due to variation among populations was much lower in M. biflora than in M. rubella, FST=0.249 vs. FST=0.895, and the estimated gene flow much higher, Nm=0.745 vs. Nm=0.029, indicating that M. biflora is a mixed mater and M. rubella a selfer. In the vegetatively reproducing tetraploid, M. rossii, 13 (65 %) out of 20 putative loci showed fixed heterozygosity, the mean number of alleles per 'locus' was A=1.70, and two multilocus phenotypes were observed, proving that at least two clones occur in Svalbard. No allele was shared by all three species and Nei's genetic; identity for biflora-rubella was extremely low, I=0.07. The results suggest that the three species, which are currently placed in separate sections, represent lineages that diverged a long time ago."

Results from this analysis demonstrated relatively low to moderate levels of genetic variation across populations in Ohio and Indiana (eastern United States), with levels of variation differing between color forms. Substantial genetic differentiation was detected among populations of the yellow color form and between the red and yellow color forms. Additionally, analyses showed genetic structuring of sympatric and allopatric populations of M. hypopitys by color form, a distinction that may support a taxonomic revision at the subspecific level.

Location North America: Pacific Northwest and north-eastern USA/south-eastern Canada. Methods Palaeodistribution modelling was carried out to determine suitable climatic regions for M. hypopitys at the LGM. We analysed between 155 and 176 individuals from 39 locations spanning the species' entire range in North America. Sequence data were obtained for the chloroplast rps2 gene (n = 168) and for the nuclear ITS region (n = 158). Individuals were also genotyped for eight microsatellite loci (n = 176). Interpolation of diversity values was used to visualize the range-wide distribution of genetic diversity for each of the three marker classes. Minimum spanning networks were constructed showing the relationships between the rps2 and ITS haplotypes, and the geographical distributions of these haplotypes were plotted. The numbers of genetic clusters based on the microsatellite data were estimated using Bayesian clustering approaches. Results The palaeodistribution modelling indicated suitable climate envelopes for M. hypopitys at the LGM in both the Pacific Northwest and south-eastern USA. High levels of genetic diversity and endemic haplotypes were found in Oregon, the Alexander Archipelago, Wisconsin, and in the south-eastern part of the species' distribution range. Main conclusions Our results suggest a complex recolonization history for M. hypopitys in North America, involving persistence in separate eastern and western refugia. A generally high degree of congruence between the different marker classes analysed indicated the presence of multiple refugia, with at least two refugia in each area. In the west, putative refugia were identified in Oregon and the Alexander Archipelago, whereas eastern refugia may have been located in the southern part of the species' current distribution, as well as in the 'Driftless Area'. These findings are in contrast to a previous study on the related species Orthilia secunda, which has a similar disjunct distribution to M. hypopitys, but which appears to have recolonized solely from western refugia."

These effects can be exacerbated where range-edge populations are fragmented. The main aim of the present study was to assess the levels of genetic diversity in remnant populations of Hypopitys monotropa (syn. Monotropa hypopitys; yellow bird's nest) at the edge of the species' European range in Northern Ireland, since these remnant populations are small and highly fragmented. Methods Every plant found through surveys of 21 extant populations was genotyped for eight microsatellite loci to estimate levels and patterns of genetic diversity and clonality. Key Results Levels of genetic diversity were relatively high in the populations studied, and the incidence of clonal reproduction was generally low, with a mean of only 14.45% of clonal individuals. Clones were small and highly spatially structured. Levels of inbreeding, however, were high. Conclusions The observed low levels of clonality suggest that the majority of genets in the populations of H. monotropa studied are fertile and that reproduction is predominantly sexual. As the species is highly self-compatible, it is likely that the high levels of inbreeding observed in the populations in the present study are the result of self-pollination, particularly given the small numbers of individuals in most of the patches. Given this extent of inbreeding, further genetic monitoring would be advisable to ensure that genetic diversity is maintained."

Phylogeographic analysis was carried out to determine the distribution of genetic variation across the range of each species and to test whether both correspond to the "classic" model of high diversity in the south, with decreasing diversity at higher latitudes, or whether the cold-adapted O. secunda might retain more genetic variation in northern populations. In addition, projected species distributions based on a future climate scenario were modelled to assess how changes in the species ranges might impact on total intraspecific diversity in both cases. Results: Palaeodistribution modelling and phylogeographic analysis using multiple genetic markers (chloroplast trnS-trnG region, nuclear ITS and microsatellites for O. secunda; chloroplast rps2, nuclear ITS and microsatellites for M. hypopitys) indicated that both species persisted throughout the Last Glacial Maximum in southern refugia. For both species, the majority of the genetic diversity was concentrated in these southerly populations, whereas those in recolonized areas generally exhibited lower levels of diversity, particularly in M. hypopitys. Species distribution modelling based on projected future climate indicated substantial changes in the ranges of both species, with a loss of southern and central populations, and a potential northward expansion for the temperate M. hypopitys. Conclusions: Both Orthilia secunda and Monotropa hypopitys appear to have persisted through the LGM in Europe in southern refugia. The boreal O. secunda, however, has retained a larger proportion of its genetic diversity in more northerly populations outside these refugial areas than the temperate M. hypopitys. Given that future species distribution modelling suggests northern range shifts and loss of suitable habitat in the southern parts of the species' current distributions, extinction of genetically diverse rear edge populations could have a significant effect in the rangewide intraspecific diversity of both species, but particularly in M. hypopitys."

The plastomes of seven MH genera were analysed in a phylogenetic context with two geographically disparate individuals sequenced for Allotropa, Monotropa, and Pityopus. The plastomes of nonphotosynthetic Ericaceae are highly reduced in size (c. 33-41 kbp) and content, having lost all photosynthesis-related genes, and are reduced to encoding housekeeping genes as well as a protease subunit (clpP)-like and acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunit D (accD)-like open reading frames. Despite an increase in the rate of their nucleotide substitutions, the remaining protein-coding genes are typically under purifying selection in full MHs. We also identified ribosomal proteins under relaxed or neutral selection. These plastomes also exhibit striking structural rearrangements.

It is protected under domestic and international legislation. In order to protect this species information is required on the ecological tolerances of the plant and the main threats to the species need to be elucidated. In addition, effective monitoring strategies are required to identify when and where the plant is endangered. The UK Biodiversity Action Plan for this species suggests reintroduction of N. flexilis to certain sites. If this is to occur information is required on when to reintroduce the plant, in what form (seed or plant) and from where. This study attempts to address some of these gaps in our knowledge of the ecology of N. flexilis. This report is a summarised version of the PhD thesis of Wingfield (2002). Main findings 

N. flexilis fitness can be assessed using the trait measurements (leaf area/shoot length) x (reproductive number/shoot length). This can be predicted for Scottish and Irish sites. 

The two main threats to N. flexilis appear to be eutrophication (in eutrophic, high pH, conditions plants cannot photosynthesise due to a lack of CO2 for this obligate dissolved CO2 – user species); and acidification, when plants appear unable to produce seeds in low pH conditions.

N. flexilis “present” (recorded within the past 4 years) and “absent” (recorded >4 years ago but not subsequently) sites differ significantly in pH, conductivity, alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, potassium and total phosphate levels in the water; and iron and phosphate levels in the sediment. 

N. flexilis was found to grow in National Vegetation Classification (NVC) (Rodwell, 1995) communities A13, A24a and A23. It was also found to grow in Palmer’s (1989) Standing Water Types (SWT) 3, 4 and 5. The SWT whole-loch plant community description was a better indication of the ability of the loch to support N. flexilis than the NVC micro-habitat plant community description. N. flexilis appeared always to thrive in type 4 lochs, but the most oligotrophic type 3 and most eutrophic type 5 lochs could not support N. flexilis. 

The presence of invasive Elodea canadensis and/or Elodea nuttallii has been considered as threats to N. flexilis. Although both Elodea spp. can be found to grow with N. flexilis with no observed detrimental effects, there are also reports of N. flexilis being out-competed by Elodea spp.  

N. flexilis individuals appear to be genetically more similar to other individuals within the same loch than to those from other lochs. There does not appear to be a link between geography and genotype. No relationship was found between genotype and environment. A relationship was found between genetic variability within a population and exposure. 

N. flexilis was found to germinate best in light, deoxygenated conditions at 16°C and above; and in dark, deoxygenated conditions at 11°C. These conditions would typically prevail in late June in Scottish lochs."

Almost all the species belonging to the section Onobrychis clustered together. A similar pattern was found with the species belonging to the section Hymenobrychis, while those of the section Lophobrychis did not cluster together. The results indicate that the section Lophobrychis has a comparatively derived organization that can be attributed to the differences in their taxonomic delimitation. Geographical pattern was found to be associated with the genetic diversity within the species. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) indicated a high association among the sections Lophobrychis, Heliobrychis, and Hymenobrychis. Thus, the present subgeneric classification of Onobrychis (Onobrychis and Sisyrosema) was not supported.

 framework for a more detailed examination of one of the ten molecularly
 circumscribed groups identified, the Ophrys fuciflora aggregate. The
 group is highly morphologically variable, prone to phenotypic
 convergence, shows low levels of sequence divergence and contains an
 unusually large proportion of threatened taxa, including the rarest
 Ophrys species in the UK. The aims of this study were to (a)
 circumscribe minimum resolvable genetically distinct entities within
 the O. fuciflora aggregate, and (b) assess the likelihood of gene flow
 between genetically and geographically distinct entities at the species
 and population levels.
 Fifty-five accessions sampled in Europe and Asia Minor from the O.
 fuciflora aggregate were studied using the AFLP genetic fingerprinting
 technique to evaluate levels of infraspecific and interspecific genetic
 variation and to assess genetic relationships between UK populations of
 O. fuciflora s.s. in Kent and in their continental European and
 Mediterranean counterparts.
 The two genetically and geographically distinct groups recovered, one
 located in England and central Europe and one in south-eastern Europe,
 are incongruent with current species delimitation within the aggregate
 as a whole and also within O. fuciflora s.s. Genetic diversity is
 higher in Kent than in the rest of western and central Europe.
 Gene flow is more likely to occur between populations in closer
 geographical proximity than those that are morphologically more
 similar. Little if any gene flow occurs between populations located in
 the south-eastern Mediterranean and those dispersed throughout the
 remainder of the distribution, revealing a genetic discontinuity that
 runs north-south through the Adriatic. This discontinuity is also
 evident in other clades of Ophrys and is tentatively attributed to the
 long-term influence of prevailing winds on the long-distance
 distribution of pollinia and especially seeds. A cline of gene flow
 connects populations from Kent and central and southern Europe; these
 individuals should therefore be considered part of an extensive
 meta-population. Gene flow is also evident among populations from Kent,
 which appear to constitute a single metapopulation. They show some
 evidence of hybridization, and possibly also introgression, with O.
 apifera."

A large number of endemic Ophrys species have recently been described, especially within the Mediterranean Basin, which is one of the major species diversity hotspots. Subtle morphological variation and specific pollinator dependence are the two main perceptible criteria for describing numerous endemic taxa. However, the degree to which endemics differ genetically remains a challenging question. Additionally, knowledge regarding the factors underlying the emergence of such endemic entities is limited. To achieve new insights regarding speciation processes in Ophrys, we have investigated species boundaries in the Fly Orchid group (Ophrys insectifera sensu lato) by examining morphological, ecological and genetic evidence. Classically, authors have recognized one widespread taxon (O.insectifera) and two endemics (O. aymoninii from France and O.subinsectifera from Spain). Our research has identified clear morphological and ecological factors segregating among these taxa; however, genetic differences were more ambiguous. Insights from cpDNA sequencing and amplified fragment length polymorphisms genotyping indicated a recent diversification in the three extant Fly Orchid species, which may have been further obscured by active migration and admixture across the European continent. Our genetic results still indicate weak but noticeable phylogeographic clustering that partially correlates with the described species. Particularly, we report several isolated haplotypes and genetic clusters in central and southeastern Europe. With regard to the morphological, ecological and genetic aspects, we discuss the endemism status within the Fly Orchid group from evolutionary, taxonomical and conservation perspectives."

Some species have found a suitable habitat in anthropogenically disturbed areas, such as abandoned quarries and gravel pits. Using AFLP, we studied genetic variation and its structuring on a fine scale in three recently established and three old populations of Orchis militaris (L.) in Estonia. Our aims were to determine whether the colonization process resulted in a decline of genetic variation due to a created bottleneck or an increased spatial structuring due to seedling establishment around maternal plants. To evaluate plant reproductive success, the fruit set and the proportion of seeds containing embryos were measured. Our results revealed that O. militaris maintained high levels of genetic variation in recently colonized areas, even outside of the main distribution area, with a limited number of potential source populations. Similarly, no differences in reproductive success were observed between old and recently established populations. The extent of fine-scale genetic structure showed substantial variation: significant spatial structure was detected in all of the recently established populations and in one mature mainland population, whereas very weak genetic structuring on a fine scale was detected in two old populations in the main distribution area. Our results suggest that the conservation of recently established populations in anthropogenic areas should be considered in addition to the protection of indigenous calcareous grasslands to prevent the further decline of this species in Estonia."

No genetic heterogeneity was found between morio-like and picta- like samples and specimens.  Moreover, morphological transition between the two forms was observed in different Italian populations.  The parameters of genetic variability estimated for O. morio populations are consistent with those found among monocotyledon plants, and among those outcrossing, animal- pollinated and with wind-dispersed seeds.  Genetic diversity of Italian O. morio is mostly within populations. Correspondingly, low values of interpopulational genetic distance were found.  This appears to be due to high levels of gene flow, which were estimated with different methods.  The lack of O. longicornu from Italian samples, as well as of any hybrid with O. morio (F1, backcrossed or recombinant individuals) is demonstrated on the basis of genetic data.  It is concluded that recurrent reports of O. longicornu from Italy are due to confusion with O. morio or with other Orchis species."

Furthermore, small and isolated populations are expected to suffer from genetic erosion and increasing genetic divergence among populations, through the effects of random genetic drift, increased levels of inbreeding and reduced gene flow, potentially leading to reduced possibilities of population recovery in the future. In this study, genetic diversity and fitness variation were studied in nine fragmented populations of the food deceptive orchid Orchis purpurea. Within-population genetic diversity and among-population differentiation were investigated using dominant AFLP markers. All studied populations were relatively small (range 12-302; mean: 90 individuals/population). Despite their small size, genetic diversity within populations was rather high (mean gene diversity H-j: 0.21, range: 0.15-0.27) and genetic differentiation among populations was not higher than that typically observed in deceptive orchids (F-ST = 0.09). Nevertheless, Mantel tests showed a positive correlation between geographical and genetic distances indicating limited gene flow among populations. Fruit set, on the other hand, was very low (average fruit set: 5.5%), suggesting strong pollinator limitation, which, in turn, resulted in very low recruitment rates (average seedling recruitment per flowering individual: 0.12). Both measures significantly increased with increasing population size, indicating that a certain threshold value (> 50 flowering individuals) has to be reached to produce a sizeable number of fruits and seedlings. These results suggest that although deceptive pollination clearly results in a fitness cost, it may serve as an effective means to maintain high gene diversity within and to counter high genetic differentiation among small orchid populations. From a genetic point of view, our results further suggest that small populations of orchid species, should not be neglected as they may harbour as much genetic diversity as large populations.

Fingerprinting of Estonian and British populations revealed surprisingly little genetic differentiation between populations but larger amounts of diversity within populations, especially in Britain. The resulting mean FIT value of 0.51 is unusually high for an orchid species. Much of the variation follows a west-east cline across Europe, whereas the much-discussed early- and late-flowering taxa of N. ustulata are considered insufficiently distinct to be viewed as separate subspecies. The later flowering N. ustulata var. aestivalis probably evolved independently on two or three occasions, each time diverging from the earlier flowering nominate race. The identity of the genes underpinning phenology in the species, and the potential selective advantages of phenological divergence, merit further study. Overall genetic diversity within populations is sufficiently high to render impoverishment an unlikely cause of their recent, precipitous decline."

The trees generated from ITS sequences and the phenogram derived from RAPD markers suggest that most recognized taxa in the two complexes are probably polyphyletic, including O. arctica var. barnebyana, which is listed as threatened in Alaska. The only consistent pattern detected by both types of molecular markets was a geographic split dividing the northeastern arctic populations from most other populations (48.60-55.03% in AMOVA analyses). This genetic subdivision probably reflects a Pleistocene barrier formed by the northern coastal ice shield. Our molecular data, in conjunction with the previously reported variation of ploidy levels in these groups, suggest a scenario of recent and multiple origins of polyploidy. It is possible that most Alaskan populations of these two complexes are best referred to as a single taxonomic species despite morphological differentiation within the complexes."

Phylogeographic studies have provided insights into their glacial survival as well as their postglacial colonization history. However, our understanding of the population dynamics of disjunct alpine populations in temperate regions remains limited. During Pleistocene cold periods, alpine populations of arctic-alpine species in East Asia were either connected to an ice-free Beringia refugium or they persisted with prolonged isolation after their establishment. To estimate which of these scenarios is more likely, we elucidated the genetic structure of Phyllodoce caerulea (Ericaceae) in Beringia and northern Japan, East Asia. Sequence variation in multiple nuclear loci revealed that P. caerulea can be distinguished into northern and southern groups. A demographic analysis demonstrated that the north-south divergence did not predate the last glacial period and detected introgression from Phyllodoce aleutica, relative widely distributed in East Asia, exclusively into the southern group. Therefore, although there has been genetic divergence between northern Japan and Beringia in P. caerulea, the divergence is unlikely to have resulted from their prolonged geographic separation throughout several cycles of glacial and interglacial periods. Instead, our study suggests that the introgression contributed to the genetic divergence of P. caerulea and that the range of P. caerulea was plausibly connected between northern Japan and Beringia during the last glacial period. Overall, our study not only provides a biogeographic insight into alpine populations of arctic-alpine plants in East Asia but also emphasizes the importance of careful interpretation of genetic structure for inferring phylogeographic history."

We examined genetic diversity, population structure and gene flow as well as the importance of genetic diversity for plant and population performance in 17 differently-sized populations of the locally rare, self-incompatible, perennial forest herb Phyteuma spicatum. Genetic variation, characterized by AFLPs, was low (mean gene diversity, H-e: 0.126) and generally increased with increasing population size. Bayesian analysis of population structure showed that populations located in the same forest patch or in close vicinity formed genetic clusters. Population differentiation conformed to a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD). Gene dispersal distances were higher when estimated within than among populations, suggesting that gene flow is more restricted on a landscape scale. Two seedling vital rates were influenced by population genetic parameters, while most late life-cycle stages and population growth rate were not affected. These results suggest that genetic load is purged early in the life cycle by selective mortality, which may buffer populations against the negative genetic effects of small population size. The overall low levels of genetic diversity, however, imply that populations are poorly equipped to respond to future changes in the environment. This is of special concern as short-distance gene dispersal indicates that colonization of new sites in response to putative changes in the environment is unlikely. "

We grew offspring of plants of ten natural populations of varying size under common environmental conditions and assessed if population trait means or heritability estimates were related to the size and abiotic environmental conditions of the populations of origin. All traits differed significantly among populations and maternal families, suggesting that genetic effects were responsible for the observed trait variation. Narrow-sense heritabilities (h (2) ) ranged between 0 and 1.13, depending on trait and population of origin. Size and/or environmental conditions of the populations of origin affected means and h (2) -estimates of some of the measured traits. Heritabilities for flowering duration and mean seed mass decreased with decreasing population size, suggesting that plants in small populations may have a reduced capacity to respond and adapt to changes in the environment which alter selective pressures on these traits. Still, mean h (2) -estimates were in some cases low, and patterns were generally quite variable. Further studies are therefore needed to gain more conclusive insights into the adaptive potential of small plant populations. Such knowledge is important if we want to understand how habitat fragmentation and associated changes in the environment affect trait evolution."

Subsequent workers have developed Darwin's initial hypothesis into an oft-cited model system for coevolutionary speciation via a prezygotic barrier. The four datasets gathered from the two species were: (a) morphometric data from 139 individuals of 21 populations in southern England, supported by SEM study of representative flowers; (b) spur-length measurements gathered by many fieldworkers from 3070 plants sampled across western Europe; (c) DNA sequences from two representative individuals of each species from nuclear ribosomal ITS and eight plastid regions; and (d) nrITS sequence data for 50 individuals of the two species and their close relatives in Eurasia. Platanthera bifolia and P. chlorantha show a strong allometric relationship approximating a 2:3 ratio in mean values for most measurements. The few characters showing greater deviations collectively reflect some but not all aspects of the classical adaptive scenario; moreover, they may be genetically linked. Those characters are sufficient to reliably distinguish between the two species and identify occasional hybrids. Spur length of both species shows a latitudinal gradient, strongest within the British Isles, that decreases northward by an average of ca. 2% per 100 km. In contrast with this substantial morphological divergence, only one base-pair difference was detected in c. 9 kb of rapidly evolving nuclear and plastid DNA, though inclusion of closely related taxa from the Mediterranean region, Macaronesian islands and eastern Asia increased to seven the number of subtly distinct ITS alleles recovered from the aggregate. Most of the phenotypic variability observed, both within and between P. bifolia and P. chlorantha, is encompassed within a single allometric cline that conflates - in order of decreasing influence -ontogenetic factors, environmental (epigenetic) influences, and taxonomic distinction. Phenotypic divergence between the two species is less than is generally supposed, and is hypothesised to reflect a simple genetic control that radically increases stigma size in P. chlorantha. Our failure to detect species-specific genetic differences between the two allogamous putative species indicates (but cannot conclusively demonstrate) that extensive gene-flow occurs between them, suggesting that previous assertions of pollinator specificity have been greatly exaggerated. This homogeneity could represent hybridisation through secondary contact of formerly distinct species, but this theory is contradicted by the low allelic diversity of the putative species, together with their similar geographic distributions and habitat preferences. Rather, we suspect that these and other closely related taxa represent a relatively early stage of speciation, when phenotypic divergence (which typically reflects minute changes in the regulation of phenotypically expressed genes) inevitably precedes more widespread divergence in the various genic regions that are routinely used in molecular phylogenetics. This phenotypically overt but genotypically cryptic phase of speciation, here termed the genetic divergence lag (GDL), renders such incipient species immune to DNA barcoding.Many incipient species may never achieve a level of genetic isolation sufficient to escape the GDL. In the present case, the incipient speciation may have occurred sympatrically and may (thus far) have led only to stabilised polymorphism."

However, the status of some purported hybrid populations is challenged by the local lack of parental species, their successful reproduction and non-intermediate traits. Despite this unclear situation, detailed genetic and morphological analyses are lacking. Here, we studied morphology and molecular markers within the P. chlorantha/bifolia group in Central Europe. Three morphological groups emerged representing Pc, Pb and a third form, here informally referred to as non-hybrid intermediates (Pn). The latter is characterized, among other trait differences, by intermediate distance between anthers [(0.7)-1-2.2 mm] and long spurs (28-40 mm). Three gene pools were identified, which largely corresponded to the three morphological groups. The Pn gene pool had several high-frequency private alleles substantiating its genetic independence. Some of the Pn populations were previously interpreted as P. x hybrida suggesting that Pn was overlooked hitherto and mistaken to represent hybrids. The non-perfect fit between morphological and genetic groups highlights the potential for fast morphological evolution. Overall, the finding of three distinct lineages within the bifolia/chlorantha group necessitates a thorough reanalysis of reported taxa and a reevaluation of our understanding of their distribution, ecology and evolution."

Rudall","2012","Contrast in levels of morphological versus molecular divergence between closely related Eurasian species of Platanthera (Orchidaceae) suggests recent evolution with a strong allometric component","New Journal of Botany ","2:110-148","Empirical paper","","","","We consider the conceptual relationship between pollinator specfificity, genetic isolation and species delimitation, critiquing Darwin's (1877) hypothesis that differential placement of pollinia on the probosces and eyes of sphingid moths explained the divergence of the Eurasian orchids Platanthera bifolia and P. chlorantha - species that have similar geographic distributions, habitat preferences and flowering times. Subsequent workers have developed Darwin's initial hypothesis into an oft-cited model system for coevolutionary speciation via a prezygotic barrier. The four datasets gathered from the two species were: (a) morphometric data from 139 individuals of 21 populations in southern England, supported by SEM study of representative flowers; (b) spur-length measurements gathered by many fieldworkers from 3070 plants sampled across western Europe; (c) DNA sequences from two representative individuals of each species from nuclear ribosomal ITS and eight plastid regions; and (d) nrITS sequence data for 50 individuals of the two species and their close relatives in Eurasia. Platanthera bifolia and P. chlorantha show a strong allometric relationship approximating a 2:3 ratio in mean values for most measurements. The few characters showing greater deviations collectively reflect some but not all aspects of the classical adaptive scenario; moreover, they may be genetically linked. Those characters are sufficient to reliably distinguish between the two species and identify occasional hybrids. Spur length of both species shows a latitudinal gradient, strongest within the British Isles, that decreases northward by an average of ca. 2% per 100 km. In contrast with this substantial morphological divergence, only one base-pair difference was detected in c. 9 kb of rapidly evolving nuclear and plastid DNA, though inclusion of closely related taxa from the Mediterranean region, Macaronesian islands and eastern Asia increased to seven the number of subtly distinct ITS alleles recovered from the aggregate. Most of the phenotypic variability observed, both within and between P. bifolia and P. chlorantha, is encompassed within a single allometric cline that conflates - in order of decreasing influence -ontogenetic factors, environmental (epigenetic) influences, and taxonomic distinction. Phenotypic divergence between the two species is less than is generally supposed, and is hypothesised to reflect a simple genetic control that radically increases stigma size in P. chlorantha. Our failure to detect species-specific genetic differences between the two allogamous putative species indicates (but cannot conclusively demonstrate) that extensive gene-flow occurs between them, suggesting that previous assertions of pollinator specificity have been greatly exaggerated. This homogeneity could represent hybridisation through secondary contact of formerly distinct species, but this theory is contradicted by the low allelic diversity of the putative species, together with their similar geographic distributions and habitat preferences. Rather, we suspect that these and other closely related taxa represent a relatively early stage of speciation, when phenotypic divergence (which typically reflects minute changes in the regulation of phenotypically expressed genes) inevitably precedes more widespread divergence in the various genic regions that are routinely used in molecular phylogenetics. This phenotypically overt but genotypically cryptic phase of speciation, here termed the genetic divergence lag (GDL), renders such incipient species immune to DNA barcoding.Many incipient species may never achieve a level of genetic isolation sufficient to escape the GDL. In the present case, the incipient speciation may have occurred sympatrically and may (thus far) have led only to stabilised polymorphism."

Restriction site analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplified cpDNA was used to reexamine the status of infraspecific taxa, reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, and reexamine previous classification systems and hypotheses of relationships. Infraspecific variation was detected in three species, but only in Poa hartzii Gand. did it correspond to infraspecific taxa where recognition of subspecies ammophila at the species level is supported. Additional variation in P. hartzii ssp. hartzii is hypothesized to be the result of hybridization with Poa glauca in the High Arctic and subsequent introgression resulting in repeated transfer of P. glauca DNA. The variation in Poa pratensis L. had a geographical rather than taxonomic basis, and is hypothesized to correspond to indigenous arctic versus introduced extra-arctic populations. In P. glauca Vahl cpDNA variation was detected only in western Low Arctic and boreal populations and may represent greater variation where the species survived the Pleistocene glaciations.

This endemic nearctic caespitose grass has been considered to be a hybrid between two of the three sympatric arctic species, Poa glauca M. Vahl, Poa arctica R. Br., and Poa abbreviata R. Br. Field observations and morphological studies indicate that Poa hartzii is a morphologically distinct apomictic species that reproduces and disperses by seed. Restriction enzyme analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplified chloroplast DNA revealed the presence in Poa hartzii of two very different haplotypes. One haplotype is identical to the dominant type found in Pou glauca, while the second is identical to the haplotype of Poa secunda J. Presl., located south of the arctic region. These results are consistent with an hypothesis of ancient hybrid origin involving Poa glauca and Poa secunda, but not Poa arctica nor Poa abbreviata. They are also consistent with an hypothesis of cytoplasmic transfer via hybridization and introgression from Poa glauca to an ancestral Poa hartzii in the Poa secunda complex. Direction of transfer is suggested by the widespread occurrence of the Poa secunda haplotype in Poa hartzii and by closer morphological similarity with Poa secunda than Poa glauca. The origin of Poa hartzii provides an excellent example of reticulate evolution and the importance of hybridization in the speciation of arctic grasses."

Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is prevalent for phylogenetic analysis in plants. However, most researches demonstrate that ITS has a high percentage of homoplasy in phylogenetic datasets. In this study, eighteen materials were collected in Potamogeton from China and incongruence was shown between the rbcL and ITS phylogenies. To solve the discrepancy, we employed a novel barcode PHYB to improve resolution and accuracy of the phylogenetic relationships. The PHYB phylogeny successfully resolved the incongruence between the rbcL and ITS phylogenies. In addition, six hybrids were confirmed using PHYB, including P. compressus x P pusillus, P. octandrus x P. oxyphyllus, P. gramineus x P. lucens, P. distinctus x P. natans, P. distinctus x P. wrightii, and S. pectinata x S. amblyophylla. Whereas, only one hybrid was identified (P. compressus x P. pusillus) by ITS, indicating that ITS homoplasy was present in Potamogeton and ITS was completely homogenized to one parental lineage. Thus, ITS might have limited utility for phylogenetic relationships in Potamogeton. It is recommended that a three-locus combination of chloroplast DNA gene, ITS and PHYB is potential to effectively reveal more robust phylogenetic relationships and species identification."

Accuracy of their identification was doubted by some later authors who were sceptical about the existence and co-occurrence of so many hybrids. Selected original localities were investigated for the presence of morphologically matching plants after more than 100 years. In spite of profound changes in landscape and considerable deterioration of aquatic habitats during the 20th century resulting in a significant decline of submerged vegetation, three of ten previously recorded hybrids were recently found that had persisted at their original localities. Two of them, whose existence had not been proved previously, were subjected to molecular analyses. RFLP, direct sequencing and cloning of the ITS region confirmed their previous morphological identification: P. x undulatus as P. crispus x P. praelongus and P. x cognatus as P. perfoliatus x P. praelongus. Chloroplast DNA sequencing identified P. praelongus as the maternal parent in both crosses. The existence of most of the other hybrid combinations recorded from Jutland was proved by means of molecular analyses conducted on plants from other regions. Their morphologies perfectly correspond to old herbarium vouchers from Jutland and support their original identifications. These observations indicate that Jutland rivers and streams hosted a high species and hybrid diversity still in the late 19th century, but most of this richness has meanwhile disappeared.

Since the diploid form of Potentilla argentea has been reported to produce seeds apomictically, the intention was, in particular, to investigate whether the variation pattern indicated a purely asexual mode of reproduction in nature. The investigated populations were chosen to represent the diploid form of Potentilla argentea. Nevertheless, sympatry between diploid and hexaploid forms was found in 14 out of 40 populations sampled. Two samples contained only hexaploid plants, and 24 only diploid plants. The ploidy level was determined by chromosome counting or by morphological analysis of greenhouse grown plants. The mean number of leaves was higher and the size of the largest leaf was greater in hexaploid than in diploid offspring plants grown in the greenhouse. Among the diploids, significant variation was found for both traits between populations as well as within populations. Genetic variation was also detected with the RAPD method. To work, the method required a number of modifications of the standard protocol for DNA-purification, but it then gave clear and reproducible results. The RAPD variation was evenly distributed within and among the investigated diploid populations. The level of variation was comparable to the level found in selfing plants, but the pattern of variation was more as expected from outbreeding plants.

Despite the frequent occurrence of cytologically-polymorphic populations in apomicts, few studies have addressed the evolutionary relationships among cytotypes and their taxonomic implications. Combined analyses of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), chloroplast DNA sequences, and ploidy have identified three main evolutionary lineages within the Potentilla argentea group. The molecular data unravelled a clear separation of European P. argentea s.l. into a diploid and a hexaploid lineage, as well as a Southern European diploid P. calabra. Potentilla argentea var. pseudocalabra was intermediate between hexaploid P. argentea and P. calabra. Diploid and hexaploid P. argentea occur separately in Western and Eastern Europe, respectively, but are found in sympatry in Central and Northern Europe. Population genetic patterns and character incompatibility tests suggested that hexaploids were apomictic, while diploid P. argentea and P. calabra were selfers and outcrossers, respectively. The data strongly support the consideration of all three taxa as separate species and an allopolyploid origin for the hexaploid P. argentea. Furthermore, the results are concordant with the strong correlation between polyploidy and apomixis in other species, and provide a model system for studying the origin of apomixis involving autogamous diploids."

However, previous phylogeographcial analysis of Potentilla fruticosa suggested that it diversified in the central QTP, which has also been assumed to have been a glacial refugium, and expanded to the north-eastern regions during the mid-Holocene period. Aim: We reappraise this claim in the light of information acquired from sampling, haplotyping and analysing additional populations. Methods: We sequenced the chloroplast trnT-L intergenic spacer of 346 individuals collected from 52 populations. We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes through Bayesian and Network analysis, and used several methods for demographic analysis. Results: Some common and highly divergent haplotypes were distributed in the central, western and south-eastern QTP. Mismatch and other population genetic analyses applied to our data suggested that a distinct range expansion had occurred between approximately 30,000 and 325,000 years ago (kya). Conclusions: Besides the possible postglacial expansion in the north-eastern QTP, our results further suggested that the range of the species radically expanded across the whole Plateau before the last glacial maximum (around 18 kya) and the south-eastern, western and central QTP regions had together provided important refugia during recent glacial stages. These findings, in contrast to the previous conclusions, highlight the importance of adequate sampling strategies in phylogeographical studies."

Based on nine topographic maps, landscape history was reconstructed and forest patches were assigned to two age classes: young (less than 35 years) and old (more than 35 years). The level of differentiation among Primula populations in recently established patches was compared with the level of differentiation among populations in older patches. Genetic diversity was independent of population size (P > 0.05). Most genetic variation was present within populations. Within- population diversity levels tended to be higher for populations located in older forests compared with those for populations located in young forests (H-j = 0.297 and 0.285, respectively). Total gene diversity was also higher for old than for young populations (H-t = 0.2987 and 0.2828, respectively). The global fixation index F-ST averaged over loci was low, but significant. Populations in older patches were significantly more differentiated from each other than were populations in recently established patches and they showed significant isolation by distance. In contrast, no significant correlations between pairwise geographical distance and F-ST were found for populations in recently established patches. The location of young and old populations in the studied system and altered gene flow because of increased population density and decreased inter-patch distances between extant populations may explain the observed lower genetic differentiation in the younger populations.

We identified key factors and processes influencing gene flow in a large population of Primula elatior, a common distylous perennial herb, at an early stage of the fragmentation process, i.e., when fragmentation is taking place. Using 19 allozyme loci, we investigated genetic variation and fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) at seedling and adult life stages in relation to fragmentation history (recent bottlenecks), selection, clonal propagation, sexual reproduction (seed and pollen dispersal, distyly), and patchy structure (patch size, plant density, and morph ratio). The main factors contributing to the strong SGS are seed and (to a lesser extent) pollen dispersal, through a spatial Wahlund effect and biparental inbreeding. Significant differences in allele frequencies between seedlings and adults indicate a temporal Wahlund effect. Patch plant density and biased morph ratio also affect the genetic patterns. Our results show that if P. elatior populations evolve into patchworks of small, isolated remnants, genetic erosion, reduced gene flow, and increased inbreeding can be expected, suggesting that such common plant species might require large population sizes to remain viable."

These lead to particularly high constraints even for common forest herbs, whose genetic response may depend on life-history traits and population demographic status. This study investigated genetic variation and structure for 20 allozyme loci in 14 populations of Primula elatior, a self-incompatible long-lived perennial herb, occurring in forest fragments of Brussels urban zone (Belgium), in relation to population size and young plants recruitment rate. Urban populations of P. elatior were not genetically depauperate, but the small populations showed reduced allelic richness. Small populations showing high recruitment rates - and therefore potential rejuvenation - revealed lower genetic diversity (Ho and He) than those with low or no recruitment. No such pattern was observed for the large populations. There was a significant genetic differentiation among populations within forest fragments (FSC=0.052, P<0.001), but not between fragments (FCT=0.002, P>0.10). These findings suggest restricted gene flow among populations within fragments and local processes (genetic drift, inbreeding) affecting small populations, strengthened when there is recruitment. Urban forest populations of long-lived perennial herbs can be of conservation value. However, restoration of small populations by increasing population size through regeneration by seedling recruitment may lead to negative genetic consequences. Additional management, aiming to restore gene flow among populations, may need to be applied to compensate the loss of genetic diversity and to reduce inbreeding."

 The aim of this study was to investigate genetic diversity in a

 shortly after colonization.
 AFLP markers were used to analyse genetic diversity across three age
 classes and spatial genetic structure within a founding population of
 P. elatior in a recently established stand in central Belgium.
 Parentage analyses were used to assess the amount of gene flow from
 outside the population and to investigate the contribution of mother
 plants to future generations.
 The genetic diversity of second and third generation plants was
 significantly reduced compared with that of first generation plants.
 Significant spatial genetic structure was observed. Parentage analyses
 showed that < 20 % of the youngest individuals originated from parents
 outside the study population and that > 50 % of first and second
 generation plants did not contribute to seedling recruitment.
 These results suggest that a small effective population size and
 genetic drift can lead to rapid decline of genetic diversity of
 offspring in founding populations shortly after colonization. This
 multigenerational study also highlights that considerable amounts of
 gene flow seem to be required to counterbalance genetic drift and to
 sustain high levels of genetic diversity after colonization in recently
 established stands."

We measured mean flower diameter, corolla depth, pollen production, modal pollen grain volume, ovule number per flower, and pollen: ovule ratios for 64 field-collected genotypes from northern Europe. These represented one heterostylous (P. farinosa: 2n = 18) and three homostylous (P. scotica: 2n = 54, P. scandinavica: 2n = 74, and P. stricta: 2n approximately 126) species. All traits differed significantly among species and among the six taxon/morph categories identified (including three morphs of P. farinosa: pin, thrum, and homostylous). Pollen production per flower was significantly higher(and individual pollen grain volume lower) in the outcrossing P. farinosa than in any of the homostylous species; also, pin morphs produced significantly more pollen per flower than thrums in P. farinosa. Among the homostylous species, there were significant differences in all traits except modal pollen grain volume. Ovule number per flower and flower size were less variable among taxa than pollen production and pollen volume. Within species, there were several strong negative correlations among genets between pairs of traits, but each species exhibited a unique set of inverse relationships. We detected only one significant positive genetic correlation; in P. stricta, ovule number and pollen production per flower were positively correlated among genets. Among species means, two pairs of traits were negatively correlated: mean ovule number per flower vs. flower diameter (but P = 0.0587), and mean pollen production per flower vs. modal pollen grain volume. These negative correlations within and among taxa suggest that there may be intrinsic genetic constraints on the independent evolution of these floral characters, but that these constraints differ among species."

In a random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis of ten populations of Primula farinosa along an altitudinal gradient 96 fragments could be amplified of which 82.3% were polymorphic. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed 20.59% of the genetic variation between and 79.41% within populations. 8.47% of the molecular variance were found among two altitudinal groups above and beneath 1750m. An UPGMA cluster analysis based on Nei's genetic distances between populations using the RAPD data corroborated the results of the AMOVA and showed two distinct groups of populations above +and beneath 1750m. Genetic diversity within populations measured as Nei's gene diversity and Shannon's information index ranged from 0.12 to 0.18 and 0.18 to 0.26, respectively. Genetic diversity was higher at the higher attitudes for the eight unused populations. Upper populations were, therefore, genetically more diverse than lower populations. Genetic differentiation between upper and lower populations and higher diversity of upper populations are ascribed to different flowering times of upper and lower populations and to the gradual retreat of the forest, which hampers the exchange of seeds and pollen between upper and tower populations but also between lower populations."

Spatial variation in optimal reproductive effort and flowering time may result in the evolution of genetic differences in life-history traits, but also in the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The perennial herb Primula farinosa occurs at sites that differ widely in soil depth and therefore in water-holding capacity, vegetation cover, and frost-induced soil movement in winter. We used data from eight natural populations and a common-garden experiment to test the predictions that reproductive allocation is negatively correlated with soil depth while age at first reproduction and first flowering date among reproductive individuals are positively correlated with soil depth. In the common-garden experiment, maternal families collected in the field were grown from seed and monitored for 5 years. In the field, reproductive effort (number of flowers in relation to rosette area) varied among populations and was negatively related to soil depth. In the common-garden experiment, among-population differences in age at first reproduction, and reproductive effort were statistically significant, but relatively small and not correlated with soil depth at the site of origin. Flowering time varied considerably among populations, but was not related to soil depth at the site of origin. Taken together, the results suggest that among-population variation in reproductive effort observed in the field largely reflects phenotypic plasticity. They further suggest that among-population differentiation in flowering time cannot be attributed to variation in environmental factors correlated with soil depth."

In spite of the heterogeneity of cold-adapted species, two main contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to explain their responses to Late Quaternary glacial cycles, namely, the interglacial contraction versus the interglacial expansion hypotheses. Here, we use the cold-adapted plant Primula farinosa to test two demographic models under each of the two alternative hypotheses and a fifth, null model. We first approximate the time and extent of demographic contractions and expansions during the Late Quaternary by projecting species distribution models across the last 72 ka. We also generate genome-wide sequence data using a Reduced Representation Library approach to reconstruct the spatial structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships of lineages within P. farinosa. Finally, by integrating the results of climatic and genomic analyses in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework, we propose the most likely model for the extent and direction of population-size changes in P. farinosa through the Late Quaternary. Our results support the interglacial expansion of P. farinosa, differing from the prevailing paradigm that the observed distribution of cold-adapted species currently fragmented in high altitude and latitude regions reflects the consequences of postglacial contraction processes."

The genetic investigation was performed using highly variable microsatellite markers on a total of four populations: the Polish population and its three nearest known Slovak counterparts. We hypothesize that the Polish population is a relic of the previously much wider Central European mountain/lowland range and is thus genetically distinct from the rest of the Slovak stock. Clarification of this issue is needed before active protection interventions such as artificial supplementation can be carried out. Our results, particularly those from STRUCTURE Bayesian clustering, showed clear population structure within the dataset: all three Slovak populations were dominated by one genetic group, while the Polish population comprised mostly individuals dominated by the second genetic group. Only limited gene flow was observed between the Polish and Slovak populations. This demonstrates the distinct genetic makeup of the Jaworki population, which is probably the result of prolonged isolation from the rest of the P. farinosa range and admixture of genes from various lineages. Their origin could be determined by including plant material from the rest of the P. farinosa range, i.e., Scandinavian, Baltic, and Alpine/Carpathian locations, in a future study. The immediate practical application of our results is the recommendation that all supplementation interventions to the Jaworki population must be limited to plants produced from locally collected seeds."

Four populations of P albida s.s. and two populations of P straminea, all from Sweden, were included in the study. Eighteen loci of thirteen different enzyme systems were analyzed. Five loci were variable within, or between, the taxa. The taxa had different alleles at one of the five variable loci, whereas there was overlap at four loci. In all, 22 different alleles were found. Two of these alleles were confined to P. albida s.s., while four alleles were confined to P. straminea. In P albida s.s., one locus out of 15 (6.7 %) was polymorphic. In P. straminea, three loci out of 18 (16.7 %) were polymorphic. In both taxa, the average number of alleles per polymorphic locus was 2.0 (each polymorphic locus had two alleles). Nei's genetic identity was 0.81 between taxa, and about 1 among populations of P albida s.s., while the identity between the two populations of P straminea was 0.98. Although the differentiation is small, present-day distributions of taxa suggest that the divergence probably started before the Weichselian glaciation. The low within-taxon and within- population variation in Scandinavia may be due to ancient founder events. The association of P. albida s.s. with anthropogenic hay-meadows and open woodland and the association of P straminea with open mountain habitats suggest that taxa may have immigrated into Scandinavia at different times."

A matrix correlation between genetic and geographical distances revealed that geographical differentiation was reflected in the RAPD profile (Mantel test: r = 0.47, p = 0.002). Further significant correlations were noted between population size and both percentage of polymorphic loci (p = 0.02) and genetic diversity (p = 0.03).

Yet few studies have evaluated if they are successful at enhancing actual functional connectivity (i.e. realized dispersal or gene flow) of focal species, or if this enhanced connectivity is enough to maintain genetic diversity and fitness of plant populations. Here we test the efficacy of an ecological connectivity network implemented in southern Germany since 1989 to reconnect calcareous grassland fragments through rotational shepherding. We genotyped 1449 individuals from 57 populations and measured fitness-related traits in 10 populations of Puisatilla vulgaris, a flagship species of calcareous grasslands in Europe. We tested if the shepherding network explained functional connectivity in P. vulgaris and if higher connectivity translated to higher genetic diversity and fitness of populations. We found that population-specific F-st was lowest in populations that had high connectivity within the shepherding network, and that well-connected populations within the network had significantly higher genetic diversity than ungrazed and more isolated grazed populations. Moreover, genetic diversity was significantly positively correlated with both seed set and seed mass. Together our results suggest that the implementation of an ecological shepherding network is an effective management measure to maintain functional connectivity and genetic diversity at the landscape scale for a calcareous grassland specialist. Populations with reduced genetic diversity would likely benefit from inclusion, or better integration into the ecological connectivity network. Our study demonstrates the often postulated but rarely tested sequence of positive associations between connectivity, genetic diversity, and fitness at the landscape scale, and provides a framework for testing the efficacy of ecological connectivity networks for focal species using molecular genetic tools."

There was significant genetic variation between plants from the two lake regions (5.9%, analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA], P < 0.001), among populations within lake regions (20.4%, P < 0.001), and within populations (73.7%.

This may be important for the further evolution and potential adaptation to environmental change. Moreover, we asked to what extent environmental heterogeneity can also reveal trade-offs among fitness components, in particular between sexual reproduction and clonal growth. In the natural habitat of R. reptans two distinct types of environment can often be found within 10 m distance: vegetation-sparse zones close to the water ("lake") and zones of competition with grasses (mostly Agrostis stolonifera) more inland ("land"). We grew vegetative offspring of 16 land genotypes and 16 take genotypes from four populations in a plant room. Cuttings from each genotype were grown with and without competition by the grass A. stolonifera and on two different substrates, sand and gravel. We found considerable environmental (E) and genetic (G) variation in life-history traits. Competition strongly reduced growth, branching, flowering, and final biomass. Lake genotypes invested mere into sexual reproduction (measured as proportion of ramets that flowered) whereas land genotypes invested more into vegetative reproduction (proportion of rooted ramets). Significant G x E interactions were consistent with a home-away effect: land-genotypes performed better if grown under competition, lake-genotypes without competition. These results indicate that genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits of R. reptans are maintained in a heterogeneous environment, thereby supporting the main hypothesis stated above. They further demonstrate that genetic differentiation occurs even over very short distances (10 m). We also found a significant genetic trade-off between sexual and vegetative reproduction (negative genetic correlation between the proportion of flowering ramets and the proportion of rooted ramets). in response to the supplementary question posed above, this suggests that the environmental heterogeneity finds its correspondence in the "genetic integration" of life- history traits within the phenotype of R. reptans."

We tested whether differences in flooding duration can also result in genetic differentiation in the clonal species Ranunculus reptans, which naturally grows in both a lakeside microhabitat and a landside microhabitat with shorter periods of flooding. 2 We compared traits related to fitness, and clonal life-history traits, of 432 plants representing nine genotypes from each microhabitat, grown without flooding or with short or long flooding duration. We also determined aerenchyma contents and carbohydrate use efficiencies during flooding in plants of these 18 genotypes.  In the flooding treatments, genotypes from the lakeside microhabitat produced significantly more rosettes and rooted rosettes than genotypes from the landside microhabitat. This indicates small-scale local adaptation to flooding duration in R. reptans. 4 Unexpectedly, genotypes from the landside microhabitat had a higher proportion of aerenchyma in their roots than those from the lakeside microhabitat. Carbohydrate use efficiency was high in all genotypes. These physiological traits cannot therefore explain the observed local adaptation. 5 Genotypes from the lakeside microhabitat produced shorter stolon internodes than genotypes from the landside microhabitat when flooded. Moreover, in the treatment with long flooding duration, there was selection for reduced stolon internode lengths, which might help to reduce respiratory losses. This suggests that local adaptation is a consequence of differences in plasticity of internode length. 6 Our results indicate an important role for flooding in plant microevolution by demonstrating that variation in flooding duration can induce intraspecific specialization even within populations. Physiological traits that determine differences in flooding tolerance between species do not, however, seem to have played a key role in this differentiation."

Different selection pressures between competitive and competition-free environments are likely to result in the evolution of specialized genotypes and to maintain genetic variation in reproductive allocation. Moreover, selection may also result in the evolution of plastic allocation strategies. The necessary prerequisite for evolution, heritable genetic variation, can best be studied with selection experiments. Starting from a base population of 102 replicated genotypes of the clonal herb Ranunculus reptans, we imposed selection on the proportion of flowering rosettes in the absence of competition (base population: mean = 0.391, broad-sense heritability = 0.307). We also selected on the plasticity in this trait in response to competition with a naturally coexisting grass in a parallel experiment (base population: 14% lower mean in the presence of competition, broad-sense heritability = 0.072). After two generations of bidirectional selection, the proportion of flowering rosettes was 26% higher in the high line than in the low line (realized heritability +/- SE = 0.205 +/- 0.017). Moreover, genotypes of the high line had 11% fewer carpels per flower, a 22% lower proportion of rooted rosettes, and a 39% smaller average distance between rosettes within a clone. In the second experiment, we found no significant responses to selection for high and low plasticity in the proportion of flowering rosettes (realized heritability +/- SE = -0.002 +/- 0.013). Our study indicates a high heritability and potential for further evolution of the proportion of flowering rosettes in R. reptans, but not for its plasticity, which may have been fixed by past evolution at its current level. Moreover, our results demonstrate strong genetic correlations between allocation to sexual reproduction and other clonal life-history characteristics."

To study whether such plastic foraging responses constitute an adaptation to heterogeneity in competition, we studied genetic variation in and fitness consequences of plastic foraging responses in the stoloniferous lake-shore plant Ranunculus reptans. Because plastic foraging responses are likely to have been more strongly selected for in heterogeneous environments, we used 15 genotypes from competitive, heterogeneous microhabitats and 15 from competition-free, homogeneous microhabitats from Lake Constance (central Europe). We planted vegetatively propagated rosettes of the 30 genotypes (totaling 236 rosettes) into a greenhouse environment with spatially heterogeneous competition. Four replicates of each genotype were planted into the competition- free halves of experimental trays, and four other replicates into the halves with the naturally co-occurring grass Agrostis stolonifera. We found significant variation among genotypes in vertical and horizontal foraging responses. In line with the hypothesis of adaptive plasticity, genotypes from the competitive heterogeneous microhabitats more strongly increased the vertical angle of the first stolon internode (126%) and the specific stolon length (166%) in response to competition than genotypes from the competition-free homogeneous microhabitats. Moreover, we found that genotypes that were more plastic in the vertical angle of the first stolon internode, stolon height, and specific internode length produced more rosettes and flowers than less plastic genotypes (all selection gradients for plasticity > 0.316).

We addressed the role of long-term population size, genetic distance between populations and test environment for the performance of two generations of offspring from between-population crosses of the locally rare plant Ranunculus reptans L. Interpopulation outbreeding positively affected an aggregate measure of fitness, and the fitness superiority of interpopulation hybrids was maintained in the second offspring (F2) generation. Small populations benefited more strongly from interpopulation outbreeding. Genetic distance between crossed populations in neutral markers or quantitative characters was not important. These results were consistent under near-natural competition-free and competitive conditions.

Rumex aquaticus (2n = ca. 200, Polygonaceae) is a widespread Euro-Siberian species but rare in the British Isles. It hybridises freely with the locally abundant congener R. obtusifolius (2n = 40) producing fertile and viable hybrids.Aims: We aimed to establish whether hybridisation poses an extinction threat to R. aquaticus in Britain. Methods: Flow cytometry, AFLPs and morphological characters were used to assess the extent of hybridisation between R. obtusifolius and R. aquaticus. Results: Flow cytometry was the most useful tool to distinguish between hybrids and parental species and indicated that out of 88 samples from two hybrid populations, 85% were likely to be F1s and only 15% were likely to be back-crosses to R. aquaticus. AFLP markers were only able to identify putative F1 hybrids reliably and 11 morphological traits could not distinguish unambiguously between hybrids and pure R. aquaticus. Conclusions: Although our data suggest that genetic assimilation of pure R. aquaticus populations is unlikely to be the case in the future, there is a potential threat from demographic swamping by hybrids and targeted protection of R. aquaticus habitat is proposed as a management strategy."

 idea that there are only two widespread Ruppia species suggests a
 uniform and very homogenized population structure following the
 hypothesis of long-distance-dispersal through strong bird-mediated
 dispersal events. Therefore, the Ruppia chloroplast DNA diversity was
 investigated along a more than 1,000 km transect of the Iberian
 Peninsula. We studied 492 individuals from 11 wetland areas (17 ponds)
 and sequenced a 1,753-bp length of seven chloroplast introns. Eight
 haplotypes represented at least four distinct groups or taxa which is
 higher than commonly accepted. Six wetland areas contained more than
 one haplotype and within-pond diversity occurred within distances as
 small as 30 m (5 out of 17 cases). This underlines the importance of
 single waterbodies for harbouring haplotypic diversity in Ruppia.
 Unique haplotypes were observed in four wetland areas and R. maritima
 was detected only from a low salinity pond, suggesting the species
 might be more rare than previously accepted. The present results tend
 to minimize an overall effect of strong bird-mediated dispersal. This
 emphasizes the role of regional pond habitat diversity for the
 preservation of Ruppia taxa and their unique haplotype diversity in

This study addresses the current classification of species in the genus, the origin of putative hybrids and polyploids, and the distribution of Ruppia species. Methods: Separate molecular phylogenetic analyses using plastid DNA and nuclear-encoded PHYB data sets were performed after chromosome observations. Key results: The resultant trees were largely congruent between genomes, but were incongruent in two respects: the first incongruence may be caused by long outgroup branches and their effect on ingroup rooting, and the second is caused by the existence of heterogeneous PHYB sequences for several accessions that may reflect several independent hybridization events. Several morphological species recognized in previous taxonomic revisions appear paraphyletic in plastid DNA and PHYB trees. Conclusions: Given the molecular phylogenies, and considering chromosome number and morphology, three species and one species complex comprising six lineages were discerned. A putative allotriploid, an allotetraploid, and a lineage of hybrid origin were identified within the species complex, and a hybrid was found outside the species complex, and their respective putative parental taxa were inferred. With respect to biogeography, a remarkably discontinuous distribution was identified in two cases, for which bird-mediated seed dispersal may be a reasonable explanation."

We aimed at characterizing the geographic structure of the chloroplast DNA haplotype diversity of 56 Ruppia populations across the European part of the Mediterranean. On the basis of five cpDNA markers (total length of 2300 bp) 16 haplotypes were obtained for 1546 individuals. Three populations of R. maritima showed a single haplotype and differed in five insertions/deletions and 16 substitutions from a highly variable R. cirrhosa species complex, which included R. drepanensis. The haplotype diversity of this species complex was much higher in the western Mediterranean basin than in the eastern basin. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed significant differentiation of R. cirrhosa between the two basins and also within the western Mediterranean thereby suggesting the latter as an important centre of Ruppia diversity. An isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern was stronger between the West-East basin populations than within basins. A PCO analysis of the western basin populations indicated a diversity gradient with those of Sardinia as polymorph intermediates. The low diversity within the eastern basin suggests that the observed gradient could be hypothesized as a historical dispersal of only a limited number of haplotypes from west to east."

The evolutionary history of this genus has been affected by the processes of hybridization, polyploidization, and vicariance, which have resulted in uncertainty regarding the number of species. In the present study, we apply microsatellite markers for the identification, genetic characterization, and detection of hybridization events among populations of putative Ruppia species found in the southern Iberian Peninsula, with the exception of a clearly distinct species, the diploid Ruppia maritima. Microsatellite markers group the populations into genetically distinct entities that are not coincident with geographical location and contain unique diagnostic alleles. These results support the interpretation of these entities as distinct species: designated here as (1) Ruppia drepanensis, (2) Ruppia cf. maritima, and (3) Ruppia cirrhosa. A fourth distinct genetic entity was identified as a putative hybrid between R. cf. maritima and R. cirrhosa because it contained a mixture of microsatellite alleles that are otherwise unique to these putative species. Hence, our analyses were able to discriminate among different genetic entities of Ruppia and, by adding multilocus nuclear markers, we confirm hybridization as an important process of speciation within the genus. In addition, careful taxonomic curation of the samples enabled us to determine the genotypic and genetic diversity and differentiation among populations of each putative Ruppia species. This will be important for identifying diversity hotspots and evaluating patterns of population genetic connectivity. "

Recent studies provided insight into species circumscription, organelle takeover by hybridization, and revealed the importance of verifying species identification to avoid distorting effects of mixing different species, when estimating population connectivity. In the present study, we use microsatellite markers to determine population diversity and connectivity patterns in Ruppia cirrhosa including two spatial scales: (1) from the Atlantic Iberian coastline in Portugal to the Siculo-Tunisian Strait in Sicily and (2) within the Iberian Peninsula comprising the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition. The higher diversity in the Mediterranean Sea suggests that populations have had longer persistence there, suggesting a possible origin and/or refugial area for the species. The high genotypic diversities highlight the importance of sexual reproduction for survival and maintenance of populations. Results revealed a regional population structure matching a continent-island model, with strong genetic isolation and low gene flow between populations. This population structure could be maintained by waterbirds, acting as occasional dispersal vectors. This information elucidates ecological strategies of brackish plant species in coastal lagoons, suggesting mechanisms used by this species to colonize new isolated habitats and dominate brackish aquatic macrophyte systems, yet maintaining strong genetic structure suggestive of very low dispersal."

Along European Coastal Lagoons From Genetic Imprint and Simulated Dispersal Trajectories","Frontiers In Plant Science","9","Empirical paper","","","","Coastal salt- and brackish water lagoons are unique shallow habitats characterized by beds of submerged seagrasses and salt-tolerant Ruppia species. Established long-term and large-scale patterns of connectivity in lagoon systems can be strongly determined by patterns of nearshore and coastal currents next to local bird-mediated seed dispersal. Despite the importance of dispersal in landscape ecology, characterizing patterns of connectivity remains challenging in aquatic systems. Here, we aimed at inferring connectivity distances of Ruppia cirrhosa along European coastal lagoons using a population genetic imprint and modeled dispersal trajectories using an eddy-resolving numerical ocean model that includes tidal forcing. We investigated 1,303 individuals of 46 populations alongside subbasins of the Mediterranean (Balearic, Tyrrhenian, Ionian) and the Atlantic to Baltic Sea coastline over maximum distances of 563-2,684 km. Ten microsatellite loci under an autotetraploid condition revealed a mixed sexual and vegetative reproduction mode. A pairwise F-ST permutation test of populations revealed high levels of historical connectivity only for distance classes up to 104-280 km. Since full range analysis was not fully explanatory, we assessed connectivity in more detail at coastline and subbasin level using four approaches. Firstly, a regression over restricted geographical distances (300 km) was done though remained comparable to full range analysis. Secondly, piecewise linear regression analyses yielded much better explained variance but the obtained breakpoints were shifted toward greater geographical distances due to a flat slope of regression lines that most likely reflect genetic drift. Thirdly, classification and regression tree analyses revealed threshold values of 47-179 km. Finally, simulated ocean surface dispersal trajectories for propagules with floating periods of 1-4 weeks, were congruent with inferred distances, a spatial Bayesian admixed gene pool clustering and a barrier detection method. A kinship based spatial autocorrelation showed a contemporary within-lagoon connectivity up to 20 km. Our findings indicate that strong differentiation or admixtures shaped historical connectivity and that a pre- and post LGM genetic imprint of R. cirrhosa along the European coasts was maintained from their occurrence in primary habitats. Additionally, this study demonstrates the importance of unraveling thresholds of genetic breaks in combination with ocean dispersal modeling to infer patterns of connectivity."

The diversity of euryhaline Ruppia populations from different continents recently became better understood from a suite of chloroplast sequences but limited nuclear markers. These revealed a high complexity from hybridization, introgression, polyploidy and haplotypic divergence. Because of this complexity within the genus and multiple allelic states in polyploids, three multiplexed sets of 24 nuclear microsatellites were developed from four Ruppia provenances and cross-amplified on 130 individuals from a wide range of taxa in various aquatic habitats on different continents. Secondly, pure R. cirrhosa and R. maritima individuals could be unambiguously identified from their introgressed hybrids and from other known or yet unidentified taxa, using diagnostic markers that referred to autotetraploid individuals in R. cirrhosa and allotetraploidy in an ancient hybrid complex haplogroup E'. Thirdly, a phenetic barcoding approach of trnH-psbA chloroplast haplotypes taking into account insertion-deletion variations, revealed lineages of recently described taxa from lagoons in different continents (i.e. R. sinensis, R. brevipedunculata, R. mexicana) in addition to separate lineages of hybrid origin. Congruence between pollination mode and diversification of lineages, allows one to hypothesize whether selfing underwater leads to clearly separated lineages whereas outcrossing at the water surface allows hybridization and extensive introgression with potential chloroplast capture. This study raises a renewed interest in cryptic lineages, hybrid taxa and shallow phylogenies of Ruppia lineages, thereby critically questioning worldwide distributions of least concern species. Recognition and monitoring of unique Ruppia lineages will support further studies on connectivity, survival strategies and movement ecology to aid in determining the conservation status of a wide variety of lagoon and coastal wetland habitats."

The results confirmed that S. lapponum pollen viability and germinability, for both fresh and stored pollen, were high and so were the seed germination ability and dynamics. All individuals were of sexual origin and the expected heterozygosity was moderate. In spite of this, young individuals were observed in only 1 out of 5 studied populations and it was the most numerous one. Although the genetic diversity among the populations was not very high (Phi(PT) = 0.12), it accumulated in a quite short period of time, probably during the second part of the 20th century, as a consequence of habitat fragmentation. A lack of gene flow, either by pollen or seeds, may lead to further differentiation of the populations and extinction of the smallest ones.

For this purpose, the genetic variability of five groups of plants, which were located 50 to 130 m away from one another, was assessed using the AFLP method. GenoType software did not indicate clonal individuals in the studied population. Although the groups were located at short distances from one another, the genetic differentiation between them, expressed as FPT and GST coefficients, was very high and the clustering methods adopted showed the presence of genetic structure. The lack of correlation between geographic distance and pair-wise FPT indicated that at least in the past the gene flow was fluent, but nowadays seedling recruitment is barely visible. These results can be explained by the fact that from the beginning of the 21st century the Lake Bikcze population has dramatically decreased in size.

In addition, in small populations with a long inbreeding history selection may have purged the population of its genetic load. Therefore, a positive relationship between population size (or level of genetic variation) and level of additional inbreeding depression, here referred to as inbreeding load, may be expected, In a previous study on the rare and threatened perennial Salvia pratensis, a positive correlation between population size and level of allozyme variation has been demonstrated. In the present study, the inbreeding load in six populations of varying size and allozyme variation was investigated. In the greenhouse, significant inbreeding load in mean seed weight, proportion of germination, plant size, regenerative capacity, and survival was demonstrated. In a held experiment with the two largest and the two smallest populations, survival of selfed progeny was 16% to 63% lower than survival of outcrossed progeny. In addition, survival of outcrossed progeny was, with the exception of the largest population, lower (16% to 37%) than of hybrid progeny, resulting from crosses between populations. Effects on plant size were qualitatively similar to the effects on survival, but these effects were variable in time because of differential survival of larger individuals. In all populations the total inbreeding load, that is, the effects on size and survival multiplicated, increased in time. It was demonstrated that inbreeding load in different characters may be independent. At no time and for no character was inbreeding load or the heterosis effect correlated to the mean number of alleles per locus, indicating that allozyme variation is not representative for variation at fitness loci in these populations. Combined with results of previous investigations, these results suggest that the small populations are in an early phase of the genetic erosion process. In this phase, allozyme variation, which is supposed to be (nearly) neutral, has been affected by genetic erosion but the selectively nonneutral variation is only slightly affected. These results stress the need for detailed information about the inbreeding history of small populations. The relative performance of selfed progeny was lowest in all populations, in the greenhouse as well as in the field, and inbreeding depression could still influence the extinction probabilities of the small populations."

In small populations loss of genetic variation due to high levels of genetic drift and inbreeding may result in decline of individual fitness and increase the chance of population extinction.  This chain of processes is known as genetic erosion.  In this study we tested the genetic erosion hypothesis by investigating the relation between morphological variation and population size in two perennial, outbreeding plant species, Salvia pratensis and Scabiosa columbaria.  To relate phenotypic variation to genetic variation the experiments were performed under common environmental conditions.  For both species a positive correlation was observed between the amount of phenotypic variation and population size (Salvia r = 0.915; Scabiosa r = 0.703).  Part of this variation is likely to have a genetic base, although maternal effects were present in the seedling and juvenile life stages.  Differences between populations could in both species be attributed to parameters related to fitness, i.e. growth rate in Salvia and reproductive effort in Scabiosa.  Discriminant functions reflecting these parameters did not however discriminate between large and small populations.

However, the results of many fragmentation studies are inconsistent. This may be due to the influence of habitat conditions, having an indirect effect on genetic variation via reproduction. Consequently we took a comparative approach to analyse the impact of habitat fragmentation and habitat conditions on the genetic diversity of calcareous grassland species in this study. We selected five typical grassland species (Primula veris, Dianthus carthusianorum, Medicago falcata, Polygala comosa and Salvia pratensis) occurring in 18 fragments of calcareous grasslands in south eastern Germany. We sampled 1286 individuals in 87 populations and analysed genetic diversity using amplified fragment length polymorphisms. Additionally, we collected data concerning habitat fragmentation (historical and present landscape structure) and habitat conditions (vegetation structure, soil conditions) of the selected study sites. The whole data set was analysed using Bayesian multiple regressions. Results: Our investigation indicated a habitat loss of nearly 80% and increasing isolation between grasslands since 1830. Bayesian analysis revealed a significant impact of the historical landscape structure, whereas habitat conditions played no important role for the present-day genetic variation of the studied plant species. Conclusions: Our study indicates that the historical landscape structure may be more important for genetic diversity than present habitat conditions. Populations persisting in abandoned grassland fragments may contribute significantly to the species' variability even under deteriorating habitat conditions. Therefore, these populations should be included in approaches to preserve the genetic variation of calcareous grassland species."

Taxa with variable chromosome numbers are particularly challenging cases, as differences in DNA content may also influence marker reproducibility. We addressed these problems by comparing RAPD and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses of clonal identity and relationships in a chromosomally variable arctic plant, the polyploid Saxifraga cernua, which has been thought to be monoclonal over large geographical distances. Fifty-seven plants from four Greenland populations were analysed using a conservative scoring approach. In total, 26 AFLP and 32 RAPD multilocus phenotypes (putative clones) were identified, of which 21 were identical and each of the remaining five AFLP clones was split into two to three very similar RAPD clones. This minor difference can be explained by sampling error and stochastic variation. The pattern observed in Greenland corroborates our previous results from Svalbard, suggesting that rare sexual events in S. cernua are sufficient to maintain high levels of clonal diversity even at small spatial scales.

The data also suggest that the diploid S. hyperborea is a progenitor of the tetraploid S. rivularis. The four populations examined of S. svalbardensis were virtually identical for RAPD and ITS markers, whereas S. cernua showed high levels of variation, suggesting that the latter polyploid either has formed recurrently or has undergone considerable differentiation since its origin."

The cpDNA analyses distinguished two well-differentiated chloroplast genomes, one in S. opdalensis and S. rivularis, and another in S. cernua.

Thus, S. opdalensis has probably originated from a hybrid with S. rivularis as the maternal parent and S. cernua as the paternal parent. We also included S. svalbardensis in the present study because previous molecular analyses of Svalbard material have shown that this species had probably also originated as a hybrid between S. cernua and S. rivularis.

However, high levels of genotypic variation observed at small spatial scales in the arctic archipelago of Svalbard have been taken as evidence of occasional sexual reproduction. Here we assess the relative contributions of mutation and recombination to random amplified polymorphic DNA variation in four populations in East Greenland and re-analyse the Svalbard data. Greater variation due to recombination was predicted in Greenland than in Svalbard, because the higher summer temperatures and longer growing season likely increase the chances for sexual reproduction. Although we observed higher levels of genotypic diversity in Greenland than in Svalbard, matrix incompatibility and linkage disequilibrium measures provided no evidence of more sexuality, suggesting differences in glacial/postglacial history. The genetic structure and spatial distribution of clones suggest that clonal migration may increase variability in local populations, which is consistent with frequent large-scale migration in this species inferred from a circumarctic analysis of chloroplast DNA haplotypes. We conclude that a combination of somatic mutations and sexual reproduction has contributed to the observed patterns of genotypic diversity in the Greenland and Svalbard populations of S. cernua, and that sexual reproduction is important in maintaining genotypic diversity, despite the rarity of observations of seed setting."

The mainly clonal, polyploid plant Saxifraga cernua has a wide arctic distribution but also extends southwards into alpine sites. In the Ural Mountains, its peripheral distribution overlaps with that of its sexually reproducing, diploid relative Saxifraga sibirica, and fertile polyploids of more or less intermediate appearance are found in this overlap zone. We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis to address the potential impact of interspecific gene flow on genetic diversity in the peripheral populations. A total of 149 plants from 17 populations along a 1650 km south-north gradient were analysed for 253 markers. The results suggest that three Middle Ural populations containing fertile and morphologically more or less intermediate plants have been affected by hybridization. All of these plants formed a strongly supported (100%) group with S. cernua in a neighbour-joining tree, but their AFLP phenotypes assigned either to S. cernua or to artificial (simulated) F-1 hybrids between S. cernua and S. sibirica in multilocus assignment tests. The three populations were highly diverse with virtually every plant representing a distinct AFLP phenotype, providing additional evidence for formation of later-generation hybrids and/or backcrossing to S. cernua. In contrast, other peripheral populations of S. cernua were typically monoclonal, suggesting that hybridization with S. sibirica can increase genetic diversity in S. cernua at its southern periphery."

It has therefore been proposed that such species must have survived the entire glaciation(s) in ice-free refugia in southern Norway, northern Norway and Svalbard. We investigated random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) variation among 28 populations from Norway and Svalbard of one of these arctic-alpine 'short- distance dispersers', the selfing polyploid Saxifraga cespitosa. In an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), more variation was found among populations within the three postulated refugia regions (45%) than among these regions (25%). Spatial autocorrelation (Mantel) analyses showed that the genetic distance monotonously increased with increasing geographical distance. In UPGMA and PCO analyses, the populations from Norway and Svalbard formed a south-north cline that continued across the Barents Sea barrier. The results suggest that there has been recent dispersal among the three postulated refugia regions and thus that postglacial dispersal into these refugia regions from other distant areas also must represent a possibility. The observed geographical pattern of the genetic variation may have been established after expansion from different source areas outside the North European ice sheet and/or from different refugia areas 'within' the ice sheet, but it is probably not possible to distinguish among these alternatives. The results for S. cespitosa are consistent with a dynamic late- and postglacial scenario with extensive plant dispersal, and support the conclusion from our previous study of the outbreeding Saxifraga oppositifolia; the hypothesis of glacial survival in Norway and/or Svalbard is superfluous."

The Yellow marsh saxifrage (Saxifraga hirculus) is listed as 'critically endangered' in Ireland with only two extant populations. We quantified genetic changes over time and identified genotypes in extant populations that could be used as founders for reintroductions to sites where the species is extinct. Location Ireland. Methods Samples were obtained from both locations where the species is currently found, including the most threatened site at the Garron Plateau, Co. Antrim, which held only 13 individuals during 2011. Herbarium samples covering the period from 1886 to 1957 were obtained including plants from the same area as the most threatened population, as well as three extinct populations. In total, 422 individuals (319 present-day and 103 historical) were genotyped at six microsatellite loci. Species distribution modelling was used to identify areas of potentially suitable habitat for reintroductions. Results Level of phenotypic diversity within the most threatened population was significantly lower in the present-day compared with historical samples but levels of observed heterozygosity and number of alleles, whilst reduced, did not differ significantly. However, Bayesian clustering analysis suggested gradual lineage replacement over time. All three measures of genetic diversity were generally lower at the most threatened population compared with the more substantial extant populations in Co. Mayo. Species distribution modelling suggested that habitat at one site where the species is extinct may be suitable for reintroduction. Main conclusions The dominant genetic lineage in the most threatened population is rare elsewhere; thus, care needs to be taken when formulating any potential reintroduction programme. Our findings highlight both the need for genetic monitoring of threatened populations, but also for its swift implementation before levels of diversity become critically low."

LocationNorthern and eastern Spain and south-western Ireland. MethodsPalaeodistribution modelling using Maxent was used to identify putative refugial areas for both species at the LGM, as well as to estimate their distributions during the Last Interglacial (LIG, c. 120 ka). Phylogeographical analysis of samples from across both species' ranges was carried out using one chloroplast and three nuclear loci for each species. ResultsThe palaeodistribution models identified very limited suitable habitat for either species during the LIG, followed by expansion during the LGM. A single, large refugium across northern Spain and southern France was postulated for P. grandiflora. Two suitable regions were identified for S. spathularis: one in northern Spain, corresponding to the eastern part of the species' present-day distribution in Iberia, and the other on the continental shelf off the west coast of Brittany, south of the limit of the British-Irish ice sheet. Phylogeographical analyses indicated extremely reduced levels of genetic diversity in Irish populations of P. grandiflora relative to those in mainland Europe, but comparable levels of diversity between Irish and mainland European populations of S. spathularis, including the occurrence of private hapotypes in both regions. Main conclusionsModelling and phylogeographical analyses indicate that P. grandiflora persisted through the LGM in a southern refugium, and achieved its current Irish distribution via northward dispersal after the retreat of the ice sheets. Although the results for S. spathularis are more equivocal, a similar recolonization scenario also seems the most likely explanation for the species' current distribution."

This study examines levels of introgression between the common Saxifraga spathularis and its rarer congener S. hirsuta, which have been observed to hybridize in the wild where they occur sympatrically. Methods Seven species-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in 1025 plants representing both species and their hybrid, S. x polita, from 29 sites across their ranges in Ireland. In addition, species distribution modelling was carried out to determine whether the relative abundance of the two parental species is likely to change under future climate scenarios. Key Results Saxifraga spathularis individuals tended to be genetically pure, exhibiting little or no introgression from S. hirsuta, but significant levels of introgression of S. spathularis alleles into S. hirsuta were observed, indicating that populations exhibiting S. hirsuta morphology are more like a hybrid swarm, consisting of backcrosses and F(2)s. Populations of the hybrid, S. x polita, were generally comprised of F(1)s or F(2)s, with some evidence of backcrossing. Species distribution modelling under projected future climate scenarios indicated an increase in suitable habitats for both parental species. Conclusions Levels of introgression observed in this study in both S. spathularis and S. hirsuta would appear to be correlated with the relative abundance of the species. Significant introgression of S. spathularis alleles was detected in the majority of the S. hirsuta populations analysed and, consequently, ongoing introgression would appear to represent a threat to the genetic integrity of S. hirsuta, particularly in areas where the species exists sympatrically with its congener and where it is greatly outnumbered."

Laserpitium prutenicum is a bi- to perennial forb occurring in intermittently wet meadows and light oak forests throughout central to eastern and south-eastern Europe. During the past 70 years, the western limit of its distributional range retracted dramatically, the number of populations decreased and the remaining populations faced a considerable increase of fragmentation. To study the effects of this decline on the genetic diversity of L. prutenicum, we conducted an AFLP study on 20 populations from Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. For comparison, we collected the same data on Selinum carvifolia, a taxonomically related and both ecologically and morphologically similar species, which is still more common in the study area. Both species showed similarly weak spatial genetic structuring and intermediate genetic diversities. We attribute this result to the loss of habitat being faster than the loss of genetic diversity in smaller and fragmented populations. Depending on the ecological characteristics of a species, even a gradual disappearance is not necessarily accompanied by any detectable effect at the population genetic level ("silent goodbye"). In the case of L. prutenicum, habitat preservation should be given priority over all other conservation measures."

Material of all four species provides a valuable resource for detailed analysis of processes involved in
the evolution of new species during and immediately following their origin. We also report the
results of a recent study conducted on neutral molecular variation (AFLP variation) within S.
cambrensis and its two parents, S. vulgaris and S. squalidus . Widespread AFLP variation was recorded
in S. cambrensis with approximately 12.5% of this variation due to differences between populations
and 87.5% resulting from variation within populations. This shows that genetic diversity has been
rapidly generated in this species, most probably due to multiple origins, intergenomic recombination,
crossing between divergent lines and possibly other factors such as increased transposon and
retroelement activity. This ability to generate large amounts of genetic diversity may aid this species
in adapting to new sites and increasing its range in the future. The high level of AFLP variation

A survey of the number of populations and flowering individuals per population of S. cambrensis in Wales was conducted at peak flowering time in June 2002, 2003 and 2004. The results show a dramatic decrease in both population number and population size of the species since the 1980s when the last population census was conducted. A survey of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) variation showed that this decline has occurred despite the fact that S. cambrensis contains a high level of genetic diversity with each individual screened possessing a unique multilocus phenotype. The level of variance within the species was similar to that found in one parent (S. vulgaris) and slightly greater than that among samples of the other parent (S. squalidus). Only a small proportion (5%) of AFLP diversity was partitioned among populations indicating a lack of population structure and possibly high levels of gene flow via seed dispersal in what is predominantly a selfing species. Senecio cambrensis showed closer similarity in AFLP phenotype to S. vulgaris than to S. squalidus. Possible causes of this and also the high level of AFLP diversity found in S. cambrensis are discussed. It is suggested that intergenomic recombination following occasional multivalent formation during meiosis in S. cambrensis is likely to be an important cause of both phenomena, although other causes are not ruled out."

To increase understanding of how such patterns originate, we examine genetic patterns in the arctic-alpine plant Sibbaldia procumbens. We evaluate the contributions of refugia and the role of long-distance dispersal in shaping the current range of this species. LocationNorthern Hemisphere, especially North America. Methods We sampled Sibbaldia from 176 localities, including 168 for S. pro-cumbens. We analysed sequence variation in three plastid DNA non-coding regions (the atpI-atpH and trnL-trnF intergenic spacers and the trnL intron), performed Bayesian phylogenetic analyses and statistical parsimony analyses on the combined sequences, and analysed the geographical patterns of haplotype distribution and genetic diversity using data from all populations. Results Sibbaldia procumbens probably originated in the mountains of South and East Asia. We identified highly distinct clades in Europe and North America, which overlapped on oceanic islands of the North Atlantic indicating long-distance dispersal capability. The North American clade included two lineages, one in California and the other widely distributed across the continent and North Atlantic. Haplotype diversity in the latter lineage was markedly higher to the south, suggesting mid-late Pleistocene southward displacement of North American populations with subsequent migration northwards into previously glaciated regions. In Europe, disjunct geographical regions generally harboured distinct haplotypes. Main conclusions Multiple Pleistocene refugia for S. procumbens occurred in both North America and Europe. North American refugia existed in California and in the southern Rocky Mountains, but in contrast with most widespread arctic-alpine species we found no evidence for a Beringian refugium. Cryptic refugia may have existed within the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. Episodes of range expansion and contraction and long-distance dispersal have all contributed to the genetic structure and widespread but fragmented distribution of this species."

With this in view, the ecological amplitude of 36 populations of Silene nutans from Belgium was investigated and their synecology specified using vegetation composition and soil parameters; Ellenberg indicator values were used for ecological interpretation of the vegetation analyses. The results provide evidence that allozyme and habitat variations are correlated, the two groups occurring on contrasting soil with distinct vegetation types. One group is restricted to alkaline soils and typically occurs in open calcareous grasslands, fringes and scrub. The other group is characterized by wider autecological and synecological ranges with a bimodal pH-distribution, occurring on two kinds of siliceous soils: (1) neutral soils, supporting vegetation with a high species richness comprising many mesophilous species, and (2) CaCO3-free bedrocks characterized by acidophilous, species-poor, open dry grasslands and woodlands. It also appears that factors not related to soil chemistry, such as microclimate, are involved in the ecological specialization of the two ecotypes.

Patterns of variation in allele frequencies suggest two major postglacial immigration routes into Sweden, with populations entering the area from both the south and the east and forming a contact zone with admixed populations in central Sweden. While estimates of within-population genetic diversity and allelic richness are significantly correlated with present population size and geographical position (latitude), population size is not correlated with latitude. Low genetic diversity in the northern populations is more likely to have resulted from ancient stochastic events during the process of immigration than from recent population fragmentation. F-IS values are high and increase with latitude.

High genetic variation was found at both the ecotypic and population level, and no significant correlation was found between population size and any measure of genetic variation. The maintenance of high levels of genetic diversity in small, marginal populations might be explained by the perennial, long-lived life form and the outcrossing breeding system of the species. Additionally, low F-ST-values suggested that efficient gene flow was occurring within bath ecotypes. Genetic distance measures and cluster analysis using UPGMA On the distance matrix revealed that the populations were differentiated according to their ecotypic property in two distinct gene pools. It is argued that the congruence of allozymic and morphometric differentiation between edaphic races is unusual for an outcrossing species. This finding, together with previous observations of isolating mechanisms between ecotypes, strongly suggests that incipient speciation is occurring within Silene nutans at the margin of its geographical range."

The calcicolous ecotype is restricted to calcareous soils, and the silicicolous one predominantly occurs on acid soils, and sometimes, although less frequently, on neutral to alkaline soils. No clear difference was found between ecotypes. However, within the silicicolous ecotype seed samples showed marked differences in exudation pattern and seed phosphorus content depending on origin along the soil acidity gradient. Seeds of low-pH origin exuded more dicarboxylic acids (malic + succinic acid, oxalic acid) and had a lower phosphorus content than seeds of high pH origin. The exudation of dicarboxylic acids from seeds of low pH origin is probably an adaptation to adverse conditions (aluminium toxicity) on acid soils. The pattern is similar to that found among different cultivars of wheat. It is contrasted to the pattern found on comparison of a suite of calcifugous and calcicolous species, where exudation of di- and tricarboxylic acids is associated with solubilisation of recalcitrantly bound phosphorus and iron in calcareous soils."

We studied ID and its genetic variation in a range of floral and fitness traits in a small and large population of the perennial herb Silene nutans, using controlled pollinations in a fully factorial North Carolina II design. Floral traits and early fitness traits, that is seed mass and germination rate, were not much affected by inbreeding (delta<0.2). In contrast, 'late' fitness traits and multiplicative fitness suffered severely from inbreeding (delta>0.4). Lack of genetic correlations indicated that ID in floral, early and late traits is genetically decoupled. There was a trend that the smaller population was less affected by ID than the large one, although the differences were not significant for most traits. Hence, evidence for purging of deleterious alleles remains inconclusive in this study. Genetic variation in ID among paternal families was statistically significant in most floral and all seed traits, but not in late fitness traits. However, some paternal families had delta<0.5, even in the multiplicative fitness measure that suffered most from ID (delta=0.74), suggesting that the mixed mating system of S. nutans might be evolutionary stable."

Determining the underlying mechanisms of range shifts and the processes at work in the build-up of divergent ESUs requires elucidating the factors that contribute to population genetic divergence across a species' range. We investigated the large-scale patterns of genetic structure in the perennial herbaceous plant species Silene nutans (Caryophyllaceae) in Western Europe. We sampled and genotyped 111 populations using 13 nuclear microsatellite loci and 6 plastid single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Broad-scale spatial population genetic structure was examined using Bayesian clustering, spatial multivariate analyses and measures of hierarchical genetic differentiation. The genotypic structure of S. nutans was typical of a predominantly allogamous mating system. We also identified plastid lineages with no intra-population polymorphism, mirroring two genetically differentiated nuclear lineages. No evidence of admixture was found. Spatial trends in genetic diversity further suggested independent leading-edge expansion associated with founding events and subsequent genetic erosion. Overall, our findings suggested speciation processes in S. nutans and highlighted striking patterns of distinct stepwise recolonisation of Western Europe shaped by Quaternary climate oscillations. Two main potential ESUs can be defined in Western Europe, corresponding to Eastern and Western nuclear-plastid lineages. In situ preservation of populations and genetic rescue implying ex situ conservation techniques should take the lineage identity into account. This is particularly true in Great Britain, northern France and Belgium, where S. nutans is rare and where distinct lineages co-occur in close contact."

We related patterns of nuclear variation for 26 Fennoscandian and western populations to the phylogeographic patterns revealed by four plastid (chloroplast) DNA markers. Levels of genetic diversity were similar within Denmark and Sweden/N Finland. Compared to Sweden/N Finland, the Danish populations show lower and nonsignificant F (IS) values. The genetic structure reveals no grouping of the Danish populations according to their geographic origin (Jutland-Zealand). Within Nordic populations (from Denmark, Sweden and N Finland), there is a weak geographic pattern of allozyme differentiation. The high latitude populations are genetically depauperate compared with populations from Western Europe. At the whole north-western European scale, the structure of allozyme variation within S. nutans shows geographic differentiation (Nordic versus western populations), and some congruence with plastid phylogeographic patterns. A high level of allozyme genetic differentiation is found between Nordic and western populations (8.0 %), but also between populations within haplotype categories (19.4 %). The overall geographic structure of allozyme variation of S. nutans appears to be primarily a reflection of past (postglacial) migration history, whereas more recent adaptive and stochastic processes have occurred at more local scales."

Furthermore, three additional wild populations were included in the analysis. Population genetic diversity and differentiation were analysed using AFLP markers. Genetic variation in the ex situ populations was lower than the variation found in the in situ populations. Strong differentiation (F(ST) = 0.21-0.36) between corresponding in situ and ex situ populations was observed. Bayesian clustering approach also showed a distinct genetic separation between in situ and ex situ populations. The high genetic differentiation and loss of genetic diversity during spatial and temporal isolation in the ex situ populations can be attributable to small population sizes and unconscious selection during cultivation. Therefore, adequate sampling prior to ex situ cultivation and large effective population sizes are important to preserve genetic diversity. Near-natural cultivation allowing for generation overlap and interspecific competition without artificial selection is recommended as being best for the maintenance of the genetic constitution."

Obligate out-crossing (dioecy) is expected to enhance genetic diversity, reduce genetic differentiation, and avoid inbreeding depression through frequent gene flow. However, in highly fragmented populations dioecy has only diminishing effects upon genetic structure as pollination limitations (e.g. flight distance of pollinators) most often restrict inter-population gene flow in insect pollinated species. In fragmented dry grasslands in northeastern Germany, we analysed genetic structure, fitness, and habitat quality of the endangered dioecious Silene otites (Caryophyllaceae). Using AFLP markers, a high level of differentiation among ten populations was found (F (st) = 0.36), while the intra-population genetic diversities (H (E) = 0.165-0.240) were similar as compared to hermaphroditic species. There was neither a correlation between geographic and genetic distance nor between genetic diversity and population size, which indicates reduced gene flow among populations and random genetic drift. Plant size was positively correlated with genetic diversity. Seed set and number of juveniles were positively related to population size. Higher total coverage resulted in reduced plant fitness, and the number of juveniles was negatively correlated to cryptogam cover. Additionally, we found a sex ratio bias towards more male plants in larger populations. Overall, our results indicate that on a regional geographic scale dioecy does not necessarily prevent genetic erosion in the case of habitat fragmentation, especially in the absence of long distance seed and pollen dispersal capacity."

Analyses of species-specific isozyme, nuclear intron and chloroplast DNA markers confirm the proposed origin of S. arranensis , and indicate that S. aucuparia was the female parent in the hybridization. Analysis of microsatellite markers suggests that there have been at least three origins of S. arranensis on Arran. Microsatellite markers also support the proposed hypothesis for the origin of S. pseudofennica , and indicate at least five hybrid origins of this taxon. In total, three multilocus genotypes of S. arranensis and eight of S. pseudofennica were detected on Arran and multilocus genotypic diversity levels H g were 0.09 and 0.63, respectively. Genetic differentiation (θ ST ) values based on multilocus genotypes are substantial (0.344 and 0.470 for S. arranensis and S. pseudofennica , respectively) implying limited seed flow among populations.

 short pollen flow distances were most abundant, 10% of the assigned

 pollen flow shows that current long-distance gene flow over a
 fragmented landscape clearly occurs. Pollen dispersal was well
 described by a fat-tailed inverse curve. Using parentage analysis of
 established trees, maternally inherited chloroplast markers and
 diameter at breast height measurements as an indicator of individual
 tree age, we were able to infer regular seed dispersal distances over
 several hundred metres up to more than 10 km. We conclude that in

In this study, we use an array of genetic markers in a population analysis to elucidate the hybrid origins of the Arran whitebeams Sorbus arranensis and S. pseudofennica, two woody plant taxa endemic to the Isle of Arran, Scotland. It has been proposed that S. arranensis was derived by hybridization between S. aucuparia and S. rupicola , and that subsequent hybridization between S. arranensis and S. aucuparia gave rise to S. pseudofennica . Analyses of species-specific isozyme, nuclear intron and chloroplast DNA markers confirm the proposed origin of S. arranensis , and indicate that S. aucuparia was the female parent in the hybridization. Analysis of microsatellite markers suggests that there have been at least three origins of S. arranensis on Arran. Microsatellite markers also support the proposed hypothesis for the origin of S. pseudofennica , and indicate at least five hybrid origins of this taxon. In total, three multilocus genotypes of S. arranensis and eight of S. pseudofennica were detected on Arran and multilocus genotypic diversity levels H g were 0.09 and 0.63, respectively. Genetic differentiation (θ ST ) values based on multilocus genotypes are substantial (0.344 and 0.470 for S. arranensis and S. pseudofennica , respectively) implying limited seed flow among populations. These results indicate that the endemic Sorbus taxa on Arran are the products of multiple and ongoing evolutionary events. This information must be incorporated into management policies for their future conservation."

We used nuclear DNA markers (random amplified polymorphic DNA ([RAPD]) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) to further explore the origin, diversity, and parentage of S. anglica. We found DNA fragments in S. xtownsendii were the aggregate of diagnostic DNA fragments from S. maritima and S. alterniflora, thus confirming its hybrid origin. The S. xtownsendii genotype was identical to most of the S. anglica individuals analyzed, establishing the genetic concordance of these two taxa. We found widespread genetic variation within S. anglica. This could indicate that S. anglica arose several times. from different S. maritima sires. Alternatively. alleles could have been lost through recombination and/or through loss of entire chromosomes in S. anglica. Finally. all but one S. anglica individual had a S. alterniflora component that was indistinguishable from a S. alterniflora plant extant in Marchwood, UK, leaving open the possibility that this plant is the actual seed parent of S. anglica."

The hybrid from England, S. x townsendii, gave rise to the invasive allopolyploid, salt-marsh species, Spartina anglica. Recent studies indicated that allopolyploid speciation may be associated with rapid genetic and epigenetic changes. To assess this in Spartina, we performed AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) and MSAP (methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism) on young hybrids and the allopolyploid. By comparing the subgenomes in the hybrids and the allopolyploid to the parental species, we inferred structural changes that arose repeatedly in the two independently formed hybrids. Surprisingly, 30% of the parental methylation patterns are altered in the hybrids and the allopolyploid. This high level of epigenetic regulation might explain the morphological plasticity of Spartina anglica and its larger ecological amplitude. Hybridization rather than genome doubling seems to have triggered most of the methylation changes observed in Spartina anglica."

In England, the sterile hybrid S. x townsendii gave rise by chromosome doubling to the highly fertile allopolyploid Spartina anglica, which has now invaded many salt marshes and estuaries in western Europe, and has been introduced in several continents. In South-West France, another sterile hybrid was discovered in 1892 in the Bidassoa Estuary, and named Spartina x neyrautii. According to their morphology, some authors suggested that S.  neyrautii and S. x townsendii result from reciprocal crosses. During the 20th century, the hybridization site was severely disturbed, and surviving of S. x neyrautii was questioned. In this paper, various Spartina populations are investigated in the Basque region (France and Spain), and compared to the hybrid taxa formed in England (S. x townsendii an S. anglica). The samples were analyzed using molecular fingerprinting (RAPD and ISSR) and Chloroplast DNA sequence (trnL-trnT spacer, trnL intron and trnL-trnF spacer). In the Bidassoa estuary, a hybrid isolated clone has been found, that displays additive species- specific nuclear markers of S. maritima and S. alterniflora, and that is subsequently considered as a surviving clone of S. x neyrautii. The molecular analyses indicate that S.  neyrautii and S. x townsendii share the same maternal (S. alterniflora), and paternal (S. maritima) parental species, but also that the two independent hybridization events have involved different parental (nuclear) genotypes in England and in South-West France."

The results reveal an extremely low level of genetic variation in this species: only one nuclear marker ( out of 98) was polymorphic, with the presence of two genotypes randomly distributed among the populations. The lack of genetic diversity is interpreted in light of the almost exclusive vegetative propagation of the species in its northern range, the colonization history of the populations, and the origin of S. maritima ( 2n = 60) in the hexaploid lineage of the genus and in the context of the management of S. maritima populations."

To address the question of dynamics of mixed ploidy populations involving these plants, we analysed several Spartina populations (fifty one individuals) in Southern England, UK, one of which was the presumed place of origin of the homoploid hybrid (Hythe). Using a combination of flow cytometry and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genotyping we were able to identify the genomic composition and ploidy level of each individual analysed. The data show that the homoploid hybrid still dominates the population at Hythe (82 % of individuals collected in that locality) since its origin in the nineteenth century. We also identified S. x townsendii for the first time on Hayling Island (66 % individuals), indicating dispersal beyond its likely origin. The fertile allododecaploid S. anglica was mainly found in populations outside the initial hybridisation site, on Hayling Island and at Eling Marchwood. Quantification of the rDNA contributions from each parental genome showed that the ratios were mostly balanced in S. x townsendii. However, two (3 %) S. anglica individuals analysed have lost nearly all M-genome homeologs, indicating extensive repeat loss. Such variation indicates that despite the presumed single allopolyploid origin of S. anglica and genetic uniformity at other loci, it has undergone substantial changes at the rDNA loci following genome duplication."

A Parisian population was mapped during three consecutive years. Its genetic structure was assessed using isozymes and compared with several populations from southern France. Seed dispersal distances were experimentally evaluated. Computer simulations were performed to reconstruct the population history. Unlike southern France populations, the Parisian population exhibited two genetically distinct patches. Seed dispersal was limited to the neighbourhood of the fruiting plants. The simulations showed that the best explanation for the observed genetic structure was a recent colonization event by two small groups of founders. Current patterns of gene flow should result in a rapid genetic and demographic homogenization. New populations of S. spiralis could be successfully established by few founders and exhibit significant growth rates without any detrimental effects of inbreeding. This offers insight into the successful management of endangered plant species in urban areas."

After 1 mo in different soil treatments, individual pollen tube growth rate was affected by a genotype by phosphorus interaction, while it was unaffected by either main effects. Though individuals differed in their response to phosphorus availability, the rank order of pollen donors remained consistent between treatments; i.e., the pollen donors with the highest pollen tube growth rate were the same in all soil conditions. Sporophytic traits were also affected by a genotype by phosphorus interaction. The response of pollen growth and sporophytic traits to soil phosphorus content were correlated within individuals in the high pH treatments. These results, in combination with a high value of clonal repeatability of pollen tube growth rate, indicate that pollen competitive ability has a genetic basis in this species. One prerequisite for this trait to have evolutionary effects on male fitness is thus fulfilled. Furthermore, if the response to phosphorus among pollen donors is more pronounced under natural conditions, variation in this environmental factor within populations has the potential to maintain some genetic Variation in pollen tube growth rate even if this trait is constantly selected."

In polluted environments, intra- and interpopulation changes at the molecular level proceed rapidly and lead to the formation of new ecotypes in a relatively short time. We used ISSR PCR fingerprinting data to analyze the genetic diversity and genetic structure of seven populations of Viola tricolor: four growing on soil contaminated with heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cd; waste heaps) and three from control soil. The populations from the polluted sites showed higher genetic polymorphism (%(poly) = 84%) and gene diversity (H(T) = 0.1709) than the control populations (%(poly) = 75% and H(T) = 0.1448). The number of private markers we detected within metallicolous (MET) populations was more than double that found within non-metallicolous (NON) populations (15 vs. 7). The STRUCTURE and UPGMA analyses showed clear genetic differences between the NON and MET populations. Based on broad analyses of the genetic parameters, we conclude that the effect of these polluted environments on the genetic diversity of the MET populations, separating them from the NON populations, is evidence of microevolutionary processes at species level, leading to species divergence and the emergence of local ecotypes better adapted to their different environments."

Wolffia angusta and the newly described W. neglecta show the highest similarity, and the former species has an identity of 0.14 with W. australiana. The next highest similarity (0.34) occurs between W. globosa of Southeast Asia and W. cylindracea of southern Africa, which until recently, had generally been viewed as members of the same species. Other species showing some common alleles are members of a complex involving W. arrhiza, W. columbiana, W. cylindracea, and W. globosa. Within W. arrhiza, plants from South Africa and Europe are easily distinguished electrophoretically because each contains unique alleles at two loci. Strains from other parts of Africa vary at these loci and are not totally distinct from either the plants from South Africa or from Europe. Species of Wolffia are much more divergent at allozyme loci than the majority of congeners of flowering plants. This suggests that the species are quite old and that the difficulties in distinguishing taxa morphologically are the result of reduction rather than lack of divergence due to recent speciation. Because of the lack of shared alleles between the majority of species pairs in Wolffia, enzyme electrophoresis provides limited resolution of species relationships in the genus."

Their highly reduced morphology and infrequent flowering result in a dearth of characters for distinguishing between the nearly 38 species that exhibit these tiny, closely-related and often morphologically similar features within the same family of plants. Results: We developed a simple and rapid DNA-based molecular identification system for the Lemnaceae based on sequence polymorphisms. We compared the barcoding potential of the seven plastid-markers proposed by the CBOL (Consortium for the Barcode of Life) plant-working group to discriminate species within the land plants in 97 accessions representing 31 species from the family of Lemnaceae. A Lemnaceae-specific set of PCR and sequencing primers were designed for four plastid coding genes (rpoB, rpoC1, rbcL and matK) and three noncoding spacers (atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI and trnH-psbA) based on the Lemna minor chloroplast genome sequence. We assessed the ease of amplification and sequencing for these markers, examined the extent of the barcoding gap between intra- and inter-specific variation by pairwise distances, evaluated successful identifications based on direct sequence comparison of the "best close match" and the construction of a phylogenetic tree. Conclusions: Based on its reliable amplification, straightforward sequence alignment, and rates of DNA variation between species and within species, we propose that the atpF-atpH noncoding spacer could serve as a universal DNA barcoding marker for species-level identification of duckweeds."

Wolffia globosa has been separated into two groups by both methods. One group which consists only of clones from North America and East Asia was labelled here "typical W. globosa". The other group of W. globosa, termed operationally "W. neglecta", contains also clones of W. neglecta and shows high similarity to W. borealis.

We have examined whether such a genetic bottleneck has occurred in populations of two species in the seagrass genus Zostera, which are believed to have been affected by an outbreak of wasting disease at the start of the last century. A test for heterozygote excess at five nuclear microsatellite loci did not suggest the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck, but analysis of seven chloroplast microsatellite loci and sequence data from two regions did suggest a bottleneck in the chloroplast genome. Extremely low levels of between-population diversity suggest that all subpopulations can be treated as a single management unit for each species. Comparable levels of nuclear genetic diversity were found in the three populations of the primarily sexual Zostera marina var. angustifolia studied but a wider range of within-population diversity was found in Zostera noltii, which displays both. sexual and vegetative reproductive strategies. This may be due to an increase in sexual recruitment due to localised fresh water inflow into the study site near to the most diverse population. Such populations should be prioritised as source material for any replanting or remediation due to natural or anthropogenic loss of Zostera beds in the area."

This hypothesis was examined in a collection of samples of eelgrass Zostera marina (a marine flowering plant) from its eastern Atlantic southern limit (Ria Formosa, Portugal). Samples from 12 sites were genotyped using 9 microsatellite loci to compare within-site clonal and genetic diversity, and among-site distribution of genetic diversity, with previously published values from central sites.

In clonal plants, three levels of spatial organization can contribute to positive autocorrelation; namely, the neighbourhood of (a) ramets, (b) clone fragments and ( c) entire clones. Here we use data from an exhaustive sampling scheme on a clonal plant to measure the contribution of the neighbourhoods of each distinct clonal structure to total spatial autocorrelation. Four plots (256 grid points each) within dense meadows of the marine clonal plant Zostera marina ( eelgrass) were sampled for clone structure with nine microsatellite markers (approximate to80 alleles). We found significant coancestry (f(ij)), at all three levels of spatial organization, even when not allowing for joins between samples of identical genets. In addition, absolute values of f(ij) and the maximum distance with significant positive f(ij) decreased with the progressive exclusion of joins between alike genotypes. The neighbourhood of this clonal plant thus consists of three levels of organization, which are reflected in different kinship structures. Each of these kinship structures may affect the level of biparental inbreeding and the physical distance between flowering shoots and their outcrossing neighbourhood. These results also emphasize the notion that spatial autocorrelation crucially depends on the scale and intensity of sampling."

Zosteraceae is one such family and because of the relatively high species diversity around Japan and Korea coast areas, the family might have arisen therefrom. To elucidate the origin and evolution of Zosteraceae which consists of three genera, Phyllospadix, Zostera, and Heterozostera, 2.8 kb nucleotide sequences of rbcL and matK genes in the chloroplast genome were examined for various species, including cosmopolitan Z. marina and endemic Z. caulescens. The phylogenetic analysis reveals the following three features. First, based on the synonymous nucleotide substitution rate of the rice chloroplast genome, we estimated the divergence times between Zosteraceae and its closest relative, Potamogetonaceae, and between different genera, Zostera and Phyllospadix, as approximately 100 million years (myr) and 36 myr, respectively, suggesting that Zosteraceae emerged somewhere in the period from 36 myr ago to 100 myr ago. Second, two subgenera of Zostera, Zostera and Zosterella, exhibit their reciprocal monophyly and appear to have differentiated from each other approximately 33 myr ago. However, the third genus Heterozostera branched off only 5 myr ago from the stem lineage leading to Zosterella and this seems too recent in comparison with the ancient divergence of the two subgenera. Third, we estimated the most recent common ancestor of subgenus Zostera as 6 myr. In Z. marina four haplotypes were found in the sample and have diversified in the past 1.5 myr. One haplotype is shared by both sides of the Japan Archipelago and its closely related haplotypes occur also in eastern Pacific Ocean. Based on these phylogeographic analyses, we propose a provisional age related classification of Zosteraceae to argue the origin and evolution."

In clonally reproducing plants, geitonogamous selfing between distant ramets belonging to the same genet is expected to be widespread, yet empirical data are sparse. Nothing is known about between-ramet selfing in aquatic flowering plants with subaqueous pollen transfer, most of which display pronounced clonal reproduction. From two locations in the western Baltic Sea, I present data on the effects of patch isolation and clonal diversity on the outcrossing rate of eelgrass, Zostera marina L., based on the genotypes of maternal plants and recently fertilized ovules scored at eight microsatellite loci. There were no differences in outcrossing rates between vegetation patches and continuous meadow although patches were nearly always composed of single genets. Quantitative effects of clonal diversity were present in the continuous vegetation where a significant positive correlation between genet diversity and the proportion of outcrossed offspring was detected (Kendall's tau = 0.82, P = 0.0017). On a population-scale as well, the genotypic diversity was positively correlated with outcrossing. The relative fitness of selfed offspring was low (omega +/- 95% confidence interval = 0.56 +/- 0.032 and 0.322 +/- 0.15) indicating that geitonogamy incurred substantial fitness costs. Selfing rates in Z. marina may not be in evolutionary equilibrium because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of clonal size and diversity. The high prevalence of dioecy in seagrasses may have evolved to avoid the fitness costs associated with geitonogamy."

Seagrass population biology could benefit from a population genetic perspective because genetic data enable the extraction of useful demographic information such as isolation and gene flow between demes. Moreover, population genetic processes may contribute to the growing ecological risks of local population extinction. Progress in seagrass genetics is partly driven by novel genetic markers which detect variation at the DNA level and overcome the limited polymorphism of allozymes. Key results of studies in the past decade, mostly using RAPD and microsatellites, were (1) considerable genetic and genotypic (clonal) diversity is present in several species in contrast to earlier notions of low polymorphism detected at allozyme loci, and (2) genetic differentiation among populations seems to be the rule despite earlier reports of genetic uniformity. Pronounced genetic structure was detected between populations of 4 species examined thus far (Posidonia oceanica, P, australis, Zostera marina, Thalassia testudinum). The F-ST estimates varied widely and ranged from 0.01 to 0.623 across studies and species. Genetic differentiation at a systematic range of scales was only studied in eelgrass Zostera marina, where it was positively correlated with geographic distance. The high polymorphism of RAPD or microsatellite markers will allow the augmention of indirect estimates of gene flow by methods detecting individual immigration events through paternity analysis or assignment tests. Important conservation related issues such as the level of inbreeding and the effective population size have also been obtained from genetic marker data, but results are too scarce at the moment to allow generalizations. In Zostera marina and Posidonia austrails, several population genetic attributes such as clonal diversity, mating system and effective population size varied among populations within species, highlighting that there is no 'typical' population. An important gap in our knowledge is whether the effects of natural population fragmentation and patchiness enhance the genetic isolation of populations due to anthropogenic disturbances. It is also unclear whether genetic differentiation displayed at marker loci are correlated with fitness-related plant traits, and whether genetic or genotypic diversity is important for medium- to long-term meadow persistence. An assessment of the genetic and genotypic diversity at marker loci should be combined with experiments on the ecological plasticity and reaction norms of genotypes composing the populations in question. This way, the role of genetic diversity for seagrass population maintenance and growth in the face of changing environmental conditions can be evaluated."

Alternatively, clustering may be the result of limited gene flow through pollen or seeds (isolation-by-distance). Were, we modify a conventional spatial autocorrelation analysis using the join-count statistic in order to differentiate between these two causes of genetic structure.

At distances up to 27 m, alleles were distributed at random, indicating a panmictic population at this spatial scale.

The overall genetic differentiation among eelgrass populations, assessed as rho (a standardized estimate of Slatkin's R-ST) was 0.384 (95% CI 0.34-0.44, P < 0.001). Genetic differentiation was weak among three North Sea populations situated 12-42 km distant from one another, suggesting that tidal currents result in an efficient exchange of propagules. In the Baltic and in Nova Scotia, a small but statistically significant fraction of the genetic variance was distributed between populations (rho = 0.029-0.053) at scales of 15-35 km. Pairwise genetic differentiation between European populations were correlated with distance between populations up to a distance of 4500 km (linear differentiation-by-distance model, R-2 = 0.67). In contrast, both Nova Scotian populations were genetically much closer to North Sea and Baltic populations than expected from their geographical distance (pairwise rho = 0.03-0.08, P < 0.01).

This study also addressed temporal separation of female and male flowering (dichogamy) in eelgrass as a mechanism promoting an outcrossing mating system, and whether the mating system in eelgrass is related to the degree of dichogamy in the held. Outcrossing rates (0 < t < 1) estimated from two polymorphic allozyme loci indicate that the Z. marina population in intertidal and subtidal habitats in False Bay, Washington, USA, was highly outcrossing in both 1991 (intertidal t = 0.905, subtidal I = 1.0) and 1992 (intertidal t = 0.775, subtidal t = 0.611). The outcrossing rates were positively associated with the degree of dichogamy in 1992; intertidal plants exhibited a greater temporal separation of female and male flowering and a higher outcrossing rate than did subtidal plants. Inbreeding depression at seed set was estimated from hand pollinations (self- and outcross) on 20 reproductive individuals from the False Bay population. Averaged across all maternal parents, a greater proportion of outcrossed flowers set seed than selfed flowers; i.e,, inbreeding depression was detected. Plants exhibited genetic variation for inbreeding depression, detected as a significant pollination treatment x maternal family interaction in a log- likelihood analysis. By the end of the seed-maturation period (7 mo after initial seed set) some families showed outbreeding depression, i.e., greater fitness in progeny derived from selfing than in progeny from outcrossing. The inbreeding depression in the False Bay population may be an important selective factor contributing to the maintenance of dichogamy and an outcrossing mating system, as proposed for aquatic plants."

Here I estimate the effective size of the genetic neighborhood, N-b, as a means of evaluating the likely role of genetic drift in creating genetic differentiation within a population of a marine plant, Zostera marina L.

Calculations of effective neighborhood size are based on field estimates of pollen and seed-dispersal distributions, an electrophoretic estimate of the mating system using open-pollinated progeny arrays, and determination of the effective density of reproductive individuals in the population. Neighborhood area calculated from the parent-offspring dispersal variances was equal to N-a = 524 m(2); variance in the seed-dispersal distribution contributes more than twice as much as variance in pollen dispersal to N-a. Including an outcrossing rate slightly different from random, estimated neighborhood size for Z. marina is N-b = 6255. This estimate is one of the largest reported for plants or animals and indicates that genetic drift in small neighborhoods is highly unlikely to cause genetic substructuring in the study population. High gene-flow levels provided by the marine environment appear to prevent genetic isolation by distance among eelgrass patches, but the importance of drift through founder events in this population characterized by high patch turnover cannot be discounted and is the subject of ongoing study."

I find also that there is no correspondence between geographic and genetic distances separating subpopulations, an increasingly common result in spatially stratified studies of genetic structure in marine invertebrates. F-statistics, calculated for two years from electrophoretic variation at five polymorphic allozyme loci, indicate significant genetic differentiation among sampling quadrats within each of two bays (theta = 0.064- 0.208), between tide zones within a bay (theta 0.025-0.157) and between bays (theta = 0.079). Spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to explore genetic differentiation at smaller spatial scales; estimated patch sizes (within which genetic individuals are randomly associated) indicated no appeciable genetic structure at scales less than 20 m x 20 m. Calculated values of F-statistics were a function of the spatial scale from which samples were drawn: increasing the size of the "subpopulation" included in calculation of fixation indices for the same "total" sample resulted in an increase in the magnitude of f (e.g., from 0.092 to 0.181) and a decrease in theta (e.g., from 0.186 to 0.025). On the basis of the best estimate of the spatial scale of subpopulations, the effective number of migrants per generation (N(e)m) ranges from 1.1 to 2.8. Genetic consequences of the disturbance regime in the eelgrass habitat sampled were extreme variation between years in the allele richness and proportion of heterozygotes in a sample and a positive relationship between the extinction probability of patches and the genetic variance among them. The changes in F- statistics as a function of sampling scale and the observation that theta among sampled quadrats was positively associated with the probability of extinction among quadrats indicated that indirect estimates of gene Bow (N(e)m) calculated from theta should be cautiously interpreted in populations that may not yet be in drift-migration equilibrium."

Although genetic variation determines the potential for eelgrass to adapt to the rapidly changing environment in its coastal and estuarine habitats, genetic considerations are not currently included in mitigation and restoration policy.  investigated where and how genetic diversity is lost during eelgrass transplantation. I then explored associations between genetic diversity and both vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction to evaluate the importance of genetic diversity for short-term population growth. Eelgrass beds used as donor populations vary in genetic diversity, and some have little or no detectable genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is reduced upon transplantation because donor plants are collected from small areas, leading to random sampling errors in selecting stock. This loss can be minimized by using information from regional surveys of genetic diversity and structure in potential donor populations and by revising donor stock collection. There were significant positive associations between genetic diversity and the sexual reproduction of eelgrass, with a similar trend for vegetative propagation. Individuals heterozygous for glucose- phosphate isomerase (GPI) developed flowering shoots more than did homozygotes. More seeds germinated from a genetically diverse, untransplanted population than from a transplanted population with low genetic diversity. A field transplantation of known multilocus genotypes revealed that leaf shoot density in high-diversity eelgrass increased almost twice as fast as in low-diversity eelgrass over 22 mo. In a mesocosm experiment under heat stress. eelgrass heterozygous for either GPI or malate dehydrogenase (MDH) produced almost twice as many leaf shoots as homozygotes. The difference between treatments in all experiments increased over time. Together, these results imply that there could be economic incentives to planting genetically diverse eelgrass, and that genetic diversity contributes to eelgrass population viability even over the short term."

Unfortunately, seagrass beds are susceptible to natural and human disturbances, and their distribution is declining worldwide. Although intentional disturbance of seagrass beds must be mitigated pursuant to U.S. law, to date mitigation of seagrass beds has not prevented net loss of habitat. Transplantation of vegetative material from small areas of nearby beds is the primary method of seagrass mitigation. Restoration research on seagrasses has focused primarily on establishment of the plants and secondarily on the functional equivalency of the habitats. We questioned whether transplanted seagrass beds were comparable to ''natural'' beds in terms of genetic diversity and structure. We sampled Zostera marina L. (eelgrass) from 12 sites in the highly urbanized area of San Diego County and from pristine sites in Baja California. Using allozyme electrophoresis, we determined that genetic diversity (percentage of polymorphic loci, allele richness, expected and observed heterozygosities, and proportion of genetically unique individuals) was significantly reduced in transplanted eelgrass beds. Eelgrass from Baja California exhibited the highest genetic diversity. Based on Wright's F statistics, most of the genetic variation was distributed within rather than among sites (F-ST = 0.139), and the degree of genetic structure was only moderate at the greatest geographical scale (San Diego- Baja). Using a spatial statistical analysis (second-order analysis), we found virtually no evidence for nonrandom distribution of alleles or genotypes at scales of 3-50 m within beds. We discuss several hypotheses for reduced genetic diversity in transplanted eelgrass beds, including transplantation protocol, small size of transplantations, and reduced or failed sexual reproduction."

At the species level, the percent of polymorphic loci is equal to, or higher than, the average reported for all plant species. At the population level, however, hydrophilous taxa have lower percent of polymorphic loci, fewer alleles per locus, and lower levels of heterozygosity than non-hydrophiles. Except for Z. marina, hydrophilous species show much greater partitioning of variation among populations than non-hydrophiles, particularly when compared with anemophilous species. Explanations for these patterns include limited sexuality (Ceratophyllum), extensive clonal spread (all four species), and the greater isolation of freshwater populations (lakes as islands) relative to most terrestrial species and to coastal species such as Z. marina."

Populations of Z. marina from five coastal lagoons along the Pacific coast and four sites in the Gulf of California were studied using nine microsatellite loci. Analyses of variance revealed significant interregional differentiation, but no subregional differentiation. Significant spatial differentiation, assessed using theta(ST) values, was observed among all populations within the two regions. Z. marina populations along the Pacific coast are separated by more than 220 km and had the greatest theta(ST) (0.13-0.28) values, suggesting restricted gene flow. In contrast, lower but still significant genetic differentiation was observed among populations within the Gulf of California (theta(ST) = 0.04-0.18), even though populations are separated by more than 250 km. This suggests higher levels of gene flow among Gulf of California populations relative to Pacific coast populations. Direction of gene flow was predominantly southward among Pacific coast populations, whereas no dominant polarity in the Gulf of California populations was observed. The test for isolation by distance (IBD) showed a significant correlation between genetic and geographical distances in Gulf of California populations, but not in Pacific coast populations, perhaps because of shifts in currents during El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events along the Pacific coast."

The greatest theta value was observed between the most distant sites (theta = 0.095). The lowest values were found among sites closest to the mouth of the coastal lagoon (theta = 0.000 to 0.009).

Genetic structuring of a species may have important genetic, evolutionary and ecological consequences including distance-dependent mating success. In this study we used microsatellite markers to show that clones of Zostera marina in a population in the Ria Formosa, Portugal, were aggregated and covered distances of up to 3-4 m. Clones within 4 m of each other exhibited significant and positive coancestry values, reflecting the limited seed dispersal of this species. Hand-pollinations between near (0-10.9 m), intermediate (11-32 m) and far (15 km) individuals resulted in similar levels of seed set, although the near pollinations had higher, although not statistically significant, levels of seed abortion during maturation. Seeds from intermediate-distance pollinations had a significantly higher proportion of seeds germinate and shorter germination time than both the near and far seeds. Similarly, the average number of seedlings produced per pollination, used as an overall estimate of fitness, was significantly greater for the intermediate distance when compared to both near and far pollinations. These results suggest that the genetic structuring observed may result in both inbreeding and outbreeding depression, which gives rise to an intermediate optimal outcrossing distance"

One narrow-leaved species (Zostera marina) and one wide-leaved species, variously designated as Z. marina, Z. pacifica or Z. asiatica, are found off the California Channel Islands and adjacent California-Mexico coast. The aim of the present study was to confirm species identification genetically and to link patterns of genetic diversity, connectivity and hybridization among and within the populations with historical sea levels (Ice Age) or the contemporary environment. Methods Samples (n = 11-100) were collected from 28 sites off five California Channel Islands and six sites off the adjacent coast of southern California and Baja California, Mexico. DNA polymorphisms of the rDNA-ITS (internal transcribed spacer) cistron (nuclear), the matK intron (chloroplast) and nine microsatellite loci (nuclear) were examined in a population genetic and phylogeographic context. Key Results All wide-leaved individuals were Z. pacifica, whereas narrow-leaved forms were Z. marina. Microsatellite genotypes were consistent with hybridization between the two species in three populations. The present distribution of Z. pacifica follows a glacial age land mass rather than present oceanographic regimes, but no link was observed between the present distribution of Z. marina and past or present environments. Island populations of Z. marina often were clonal and characterized by low genotypic diversity compared with populations along the Baja California coast. The high level of clonal connectivity around Santa Catalina Island indicated the importance of dispersal and subsequent re-establishment of vegetative fragments. Conclusions The pristine environmental conditions of offshore islands do not guarantee maximum genetic diversity. Future restoration and transplantation efforts of seagrasses must recognize cryptic species and consider the degree of both genetic and genotypic variation in candidate donor populations."

 was not related to epiphyte biomass in either winter or summer.
 Interestingly, there was a positive relationship between eelgrass
 clonal diversity and shoot density only in the winter, when eelgrass
 experiences stress from abiotic and biotic factors. The magnitude of
 this correlation was similar to that of other factors known to affect
 shoot density such as tidal elevation or position in the bed. In
 contrast, summer shoot density and diversity were uncorrelated. This
 natural pattern is consistent with previous experimental results in
 which diversity positively affected shoot density only during periods

Over the last 30 years, this once robust species has been reduced to sparse patchy populations due to disease and anthropogenic effects. In order to better understand the consequences of this devastation on the population genetics of the species, we have analyzed the population structure of western Atlantic Z. marina, employing microsatellite DNA polymorphisms. Although high fixation index values suggest moderate genetic differentiation among most of the Z. marina sites, population diversity was low. This lack of diversity was supported by a general dearth of observable heterozygotes in these sites; mean observed heterozygosity values (0.14-0.46) were lower than the mean expected heterozygosity values (0.57-0.81). Additionally, the mean FIS (coefficient of local inbreeding) values in these sites were positive, again indicating a surfeit of homozygotes. Allelic richness suggests that Chesapeake Bay has the greatest internal genetic diversity of the sites studied. Inbreeding seems prevalent in these American populations, suggesting possible reproductive fitness problems in the future. There is evidence of demographic bottlenecking and particularly low genetic diversity in Long Island.

Additionally, we assessed the genetic diversity of Z. marina in Barnegat Bay to better understand its population structure. Clonal diversity ranged from 0.70 to 0.95 for the populations studied. Individually, Barnegat Bay populations are not genetically diverse, and there is also little divergence among populations. The Atlantic populations had mean Hobs values (0.20-0.34) that were far lower than the Hexp values (0.69-0.83). Also, the F (IS) values in all of the eastern populations indicate a surfeit of homozygotes over heterozygotes, suggesting a low degree of outcrossing in the Barnegat Bay populations. Six of the ten populations studied (Ham Island, Manahawkin Bay, Shelter Island, Marsh Elder, Harvey Cedar Sedge, and Long Island) show evidence of historical bottlenecks.

Three different statistical approaches for outlier identification revealed divergent selection at 6 loci among 46 markers (6 SNPs, 29 EST microsatellites and 11 anonymous microsatellites). These outlier loci were repeatedly detected in parallel habitat comparisons, suggesting the influence of habitat-specific selection. A second goal was to test the consistency of the general genome scan approach by doubling the number of gene-linked microsatellites and adding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, a novel marker type for seagrasses, compared to a previous study. Reassuringly, results with respect to selection were consistent among most marker loci. Functionally interesting marker loci were linked to genes involved in osmoregulation and water balance, suggesting different osmotic stress, and reproductive processes (seed maturation), pointing to different life history strategies.

Species distributed along a thermal cline, such as the ecologically important seagrass Zostera marina, provide an opportunity to assess temperature effects on gene expression as a function of their long-term adaptation to heat stress. We exposed a southern and northern European population of Zostera marina from contrasting thermal environments to a realistic heat wave in a common-stress garden. In a fully crossed experiment, eight cDNA libraries, each comprising similar to 125 000 reads, were obtained during and after a simulated heat wave, along with nonstressed control treatments. Although gene-expression patterns during stress were similar in both populations and were dominated by classical heat-shock proteins, transcription profiles diverged after the heat wave. Gene-expression patterns in southern genotypes returned to control values immediately, but genotypes from the northern site failed to recover and revealed the induction of genes involved in protein degradation, indicating failed metabolic compensation to high sea-surface temperature. We conclude that the return of gene-expression patterns during recovery provides critical information on thermal adaptation in aquatic habitats under climatic stress. As a unifying concept for ecological genomics, we propose transcriptomic resilience, analogous to ecological resilience, as an important measure to predict the tolerance of individuals and hence the fate of local populations in the face of global warming."

Genetic diversity, like species diversity, can enhance resistance or resilience to perturbation. However, we know little about how disturbance intensity affects this relationship or what mechanisms underlie the positive effects of genetic diversity. 2. We experimentally tested the independent and interactive effects of seagrass genotypic diversity (two levels) and disturbance (three levels) on seagrass biomass in a 2-year field experiment. 3. Our results indicate that genotypic diversity enhances seagrass resilience from experimental biomass removal, but only at the highest level of disturbance; in the absence of disturbance, monocultures out-perform polycultures over the short term. 4. Following recovery from the planned experimental disturbance, a natural macroalgal bloom caused a loss of seagrass shoots in our plots. In this case polycultures lost fewer shoots than monocultures (i.e. were more resistant to the disturbance), and this positive effect of genetic diversity persisted until the end of the experiment (1 year in total, including 6 months after all plots had recovered to pre-disturbance densities). At the end of the 2-year experiment, polycultures had higher shoot density and above-ground biomass than monocultures. 5. The positive effects of diversity on shoot density and biomass were caused by both trait-independent complementarity (TIC; due to differential resource use among clones) and positive dominance (due to one genotype achieving high density in both monoculture and polyculture). 6. Synthesis. Our results confirm that genetic diversity, like species diversity, can influence disturbance response and does so via similar mechanisms. They also highlight that over longer time frames, these effects are likely to result from a complex mix of dominance and complementarity mechanisms that depend on the traits of the specific taxa involved and the response variables of interest."

Studies in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans indicate that the degree of population genetic differentiation is location dependent. San Francisco Bay, California, USA, is a high-current, high-wind environment where rafting of seed-bearing shoots has the potential to enhance genetic connectivity among Z. marina populations. We tested Z. marina from six locations, including one annual population, within the bay to assess population differentiation and to compare levels of within-population genetic diversity. Using 7 microsatellite loci, we found significant differentiation among all populations. The annual population had significantly higher clonal diversity than the others but showed no detectible differences in heterozygosity or allelic richness. There appears to be sufficient input of genetic variation through sexual reproduction or immigration into the perennial populations to prevent significant declines in the number and frequency of alleles. In additional depth comparisons, we found differentiation among deep and shallow portions in 1 of 3 beds evaluated. Genetic drift, sweepstakes recruitment, dispersal limitation, and possibly natural selection may have combined to produce genetic differentiation over a spatial scale of 3-30 km in Z. marina. This implies that the scale of genetic differentiation may be smaller than expected for seagrasses in other locations too. We suggest that populations in close proximity may not be interchangeable for use as restoration material."

For example, the re latedness of individuals within a group often dictates whether their interactions are competitive or cooperative. It is therefore necessary to characterize the genetic structure of populations at spatial scales relevant to these interactions and to determine the distribution of genetic diversity at those scales. Using microsatellite data, we assessed fine-scale population structure of Zostera marina, an important habitat-forming seagrass, within and between Bodega Harbor and Tomales Bay in northern California, USA. Despite the potential for long-range dispersal, we found significant population structure at all hierarchical scales (among bays, among sites, among tidal heights), corresponding to distances ranging from meters to tens of kilometers. The pattern of genetic differentiation that emerged at local scales differed between bays, with Tomales Bay being more structured even though the Euclidean distances among sites were similar in each bay. The relatedness of genets within a tidal height also differed among bays: in Bodega Harbor most genets occurred in proximity to unrelated individuals, whereas in Tomales Bay, genets were mixed with their close relatives, likely due to decreased dispersal. These contrasting kin structures, coupled with highly variable levels of clonal diversity, underscore the importance of examining variation at multiple scales, as this reveals genetic factors which might play an important role in many ecological processes."

Preserving genetic diversity is therefore considered an important component of ecosystem restoration as well as a measure of its success. We examined the genetic diversity of restored Zostera marina meadows in a coastal bay system along the USA mid-Atlantic coast using microsatellite markers to compare donor and recipient meadows. We show that donor meadows in Chesapeake Bay have high genetic diversity and that this diversity is maintained in meadows restored with seeds in the Virginia coastal bays. No evidence of inbreeding depression was detected (F-IS-0.2 to 0) in either donor or recipient meadows, which is surprising because high levels of inbreeding were expected following the population contractions that occurred in Chesapeake Bay populations due to disease and heat stress. Additionally, there was no evidence for selection of genotypes at the restoration sites, suggesting that as long as donor sites are chosen carefully, issues that diminish fitness and survival such as heterosis or out-breeding depression can be avoided. A cluster analysis showed that, in addition to the Chesapeake Bay populations that acted as donors, the Virginia coastal bay populations shared a genetic signal with Chincoteague Bay populations, their closest neighbor to the north, suggesting that natural recruitment into the area may be occurring and augmenting restored populations. We hypothesize that the high genetic diversity in seagrasses restored using seeds rather than adult plants confers a greater level of ecosystem resilience to the restored meadows."

However, peripheral populations are also predicted to have decreased diversity compared to the centre of a species distribution. We aim to test these predictions by comparing genetic diversity in populations at the limits of distribution of the seagrass Zostera marina, with populations in the species previously described central diversity hotspot. Zostera marina populations show decreased allelic richness, heterozygosity and genotypic richness in both the rear edge and the leading edge compared to the diversity hotspot in the North Sea/Baltic region. However, when populations are pooled, genetic diversity at the southern range is as high as in the North Sea/Baltic region while the leading edge remains low in genetic diversity. The decreased genetic diversity in these southern Iberian populations compared to more central populations is possibly the effect of drift because of small effective population size, as a result of reduced habitat, low sexual reproduction and low gene flow. However, when considering the whole southern edge of distribution rather than per population, diversity is as high as in the central hotspot in the North Sea/Baltic region. We conclude that diversity patterns assessed per population can mask the real regional richness that is typical of rear edge populations, which have played a key role in the species biogeographical history and as marginal diversity hotspots have very high conservation value."

Patchiness, low density or isolation of these remaining populations increase susceptibility of this aquatic angiosperm to extinction. The loss of genetic diversity and patch connectivity, may contribute to lower fitness of eelgrass thus affecting recovery potential. Previous studies of eelgrass populations around Long Island report genetically isolated populations with low diversity. In contrast, this study found neither the evidence of inbreeding nor indications of genetic degradation for the same populations. Measures of genetic diversity such as average alleles (A= 7.59) and fixation index (F= 0.02) suggest no significant impediments to genetic connectivity among populations sampled. Gene flow (Nn, = 4.58) and bottleneck analyses suggest the major disturbances of the past have not strongly affected population structure in the Long Island system. These findings have significant implications for both management and restoration. Locally, eelgrass populations in Long Island waters are unlikely to decline through genetic erosion or inbreeding processes alone. Plants from within these populations possess adequate genetic diversity to undertake restoration activities. On a larger geographic scale, the ability of these plants to maintain such high levels of genetic diversity and connectivity despite the significant areal losses historically provides optimism for the recovery potential of this species despite recent global losses."

Ecological restoration assists the recovery of degraded ecosystems; however, restoration can have deleterious effects such as outbreeding depression when source material is not chosen carefully and has non-local adaptations. 2. We surveyed 23 eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) populations along the North American Atlantic coast to evaluate genetic structure and connectivity among restored and naturally recruited populations. 3. While populations along the North America Atlantic coast were genetically distinctive, significant migration was detected among populations. All estimates of connectivity (F-ST, migration rate base on rare alleles, and Bayesian modelling) showed a general north to south pattern of migration, corresponding to the typical long-shore currents in this region. 4. Individual naturally recruited meadows in the Virginia coastal bays appear to be the result of dispersal from different meadows north of the region. This supports the hypothesis that recruitment into this region is typically a slow, episodic process rather than a permanent, continuous connection between the populations. 5. While natural recovery of populations that were catastrophically lost in the 1930s has been slow, large-scale seed-based restoration has been very successful at quickly restoring landscape-scale areal coverage (over 1600ha in just 10years). Our results show that restoration was also successful at restoring meadows with high genetic diversity. Naturally recruited meadows were less diverse and exhibited signs of genetic drift. 6. Synthesis. Our analyses demonstrate that metapopulation dynamics are important to the natural recovery of seagrass ecosystems that have experienced catastrophic loss over large spatial scales; however, natural recovery processes are slow and inefficient at recovering genetic diversity and population structure when recruitment barriers exist, such as a limited seed source. Seed-based restoration provides a greater abundance of propagules, rapidly facilitates the recovery of populations with higher genetic diversity, and when seed sources are chosen carefully protects regional genetic structure. First-order estimates indicated that the genetic diversity achieved by active restoration in 10years would have otherwise taken between 125 and 185years to achieve through natural recruitment events."

Plants from both populations were exposed to a series of fixed salinities (2, 4, 6, 9, 12.5, 15, 20 and 25) for 5 weeks. Both plant origin and salinity affected plant performance significantly. Plant production decreased with decreasing salinity in both populations, while mortality increased in low salinity only in plants originating from the high saline population. The better performance of the low saline population in the lowest salinities indicates a horizontal shift in salinity tolerance among populations with different origin and that the low saline population is better adapted to hyposaline conditions. Despite the long-term adaptation of the low saline population to stable, low salinity, these plants were still able to function normally in high salinities, indicating remarkable plasticity. The results further suggest that altered salinity can severely impact seagrass productivity but responses might vary significantly depending on plant origin. Such variability in stress tolerance indicates that some populations have better chances to survive in and adapt to future changes in environment. "

A North-South pair of populations was sampled along the European and North American coasts and exposed to a simulated heatwave in a common-garden mesocosm.

We corrected for phylogenetic differentiation among populations to discriminate neutral from adaptive differentiation. The two southern populations recovered faster from heat stress and showed parallel transcriptomic differentiation, as compared with northern populations.

However, the strongest differentiation following phylogenetic correction was between the three Atlantic populations and the Mediterranean population with 128 of 4711 differentially expressed genes exceeding neutral expectations. Although adaptation to warm temperatures is expected to reduce sensitivity to heatwaves, the continued resistance of seagrass to further anthropogenic stresses may be impaired by heat-induced downregulation of genes related to photosynthesis, pathogen defence and stress tolerance."

Recently, however, there has been a drastic decline in the population size of Z. marina worldwide, including Korea. We examined the current population genetic status of this species on the southern coast of Korea by estimating the levels of genetic diversity and genetic structure of 10 geographic populations using eight nuclear microsatellite markers. The level of genetic diversity was found to be significantly lower for populations on Jeju Island [mean allelic richness (AR) = 1.92, clonal diversity (R) = 0.51], which is located approximately 155 km off the southernmost region of the Korean Peninsula, than for those in the South Sea (mean AR = 2.69, R = 0.82), which is on the southern coast of the mainland. South Korean eelgrass populations were substantially genetically divergent from one another (F-ST = 0.061 - 0.573), suggesting that limited contemporary gene flow has been taking place among populations. We also found weak but detectable temporal variation in genetic structure within a site over 10 years. In additional depth comparisons, statistically significant genetic differentiation was observed between shallow (or middle) and deep zones in two of three sites tested. Depleted genetic diversity, small effective population sizes (N-e) and limited connectivity for populations on Jeju Island indicate that these populations may be vulnerable to local extinction under changing environmental conditions, especially given that Jeju Island is one of the fastest warming regions around the world. Overall, our work will inform conservation and restoration efforts, including transplantation for eelgrass populations at the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, for this ecologically important species."

The meadows sampled (San Francisco, Tomales and Bodega Bays in California and the Virginia coastal bays) represent a range of life histories (annual vs perennial), age (well-established vs restored) and environments (rural vs urbanized). In all of these systems, neither diversity nor differentiation (FST) changed over time. Differences among tidal heights within Bodega Bay were also remarkably consistent, with the high intertidal being more diverse than the subtidal, and tidal height differentiation being modest but significant at both time points. Historical studies used only a few microsatellite loci; therefore, our temporal comparisons were based on 4-5 loci. However, analysis of the current data using a set of 12 loci show that 4-5 loci are sufficient to describe diversity and differentiation patterns in this system. This temporal consistency was not because of the resampling of large clones, underscoring the feasibility and relevance of understanding drivers of the differences. Because seagrasses are declining at rapid rates, restoration and conservation are increasingly a coastal management priority.

Population bottlenecks like this one often result in severe reductions in genetic diversity; however, this is not always the case. The decline of eelgrass in Morro Bay provides an opportunity to better understand the effects of population decline on population genetics. Furthermore, the failure of recent restoration efforts necessitates a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of the population. Previous research on eelgrass in California has demonstrated a link between population genetic diversity and eelgrass bed health, ecosystem functioning, and resilience to disturbance and extreme climatic events. The genetic diversity and population structure of Morro Bay eelgrass have not been assessed until this study. We also compare Morro Bay eelgrass to Bodega Bay eelgrass in Northern California. We conducted fragment length analysis of nine microsatellite loci on 133 Morro Bay samples, and 20 Bodega Bay samples. We found no population differentiation between the remaining beds in Morro Bay and no difference among samples growing at different tidal depths. Comparisons with Bodega Bay revealed that Morro Bay eelgrass contains three first-generation migrants from the north, but Morro Bay remains considerably genetically differentiated from Bodega Bay.

Oceanographic connectivity was analysed using Lagrangian dispersal simulations based on contemporary and historical distribution data dating back to the late 19th century. Population clusters, barriers and networks of connectivity were found to be very similar based on either genetic or oceanographic analyses. A single-generation model of dispersal was not realistic, whereas multigeneration models that integrate stepping-stone dispersal and extant and historic distribution data were able to capture and model genetic connectivity patterns well. Passive rafting of flowering shoots along oceanographic currents is the main driver of gene flow at this spatial-temporal scale, and extant genetic connectivity strongly reflects the ghost of dispersal past sensu Benzie, . The identification of distinct clusters, connectivity hotspots and areas where connectivity has become limited over the last century is critical information for spatial management, conservation and restoration of eelgrass."

A test for heterozygote excess at five nuclear microsatellite loci did not suggest the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck, but analysis of seven chloroplast microsatellite loci and sequence data from two regions did suggest a bottleneck in the chloroplast genome. Extremely low levels of between-population diversity suggest that all subpopulations can be treated as a single management unit for each species. Comparable levels of nuclear genetic diversity were found in the three populations of the primarily sexual Zostera marina var. angustifolia studied but a wider range of within-population diversity was found in Zostera noltii, which displays both. sexual and vegetative reproductive strategies. This may be due to an increase in sexual recruitment due to localised fresh water inflow into the study site near to the most diverse population.

The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between mating system and clonal structure, examine the relative roles of geitonogamous selfing and biparental inbreeding, measure pollen availability (multiple paternities) and estimate pollen dispersal. Methods A 100-m(2) plot was established in a large, intertidal Z. noltii meadow on the island of Sylt in the German Wadden Sea. A total of 256 adult shoots was sampled: one from the centre of 100 fixed 1-m(2) quadrats (large scale resolution) and an additional 156 from within eight randomly selected 1-m(2) sub-quadrats (small-scale resolution). DNA was extracted from seeds and leaf tissue of all samples and genotyped with nine microsatellite loci. Key Results Mating system analysis revealed high multilocus and single locus outcrossing rates. Average pollen dispersal distance was nearly the same as the average genet (clone) size. Multiple paternity was common and 20-30% of mature seeds originated from matings within the plot. Among inbred seeds, most resulted from geitonogamy rather than biparental inbreeding. Conclusions Moderate disturbances intrinsic to the intertidal habitat appear to facilitate seed recruitment by gap formation. Pollen dispersal distances are sufficient to maintain outcrossing and high clonal diversity."

The genetic or genotypic description of populations and knowledge about their connectivity are important genetic issues that should be taken into account to accomplish appropriate conservation and restoration programmes, particularly for threatened habitats or species. Therefore, a genetic characterisation of the single remaining meadow located on the coast of Lanzarote was conducted using nine microsatellite loci, and its genetic relationship with the geographically closest Moroccan populations was studied for restoration purposes. Results showed that the Lanzarote population has recently suffered a significant reduction in effective population size and presents low levels of allelic or genotypic diversity in relation to other Z. noltii populations throughout its distribution range. Moreover, this population remains in an extremely isolated situation in which it lacks long-term gene flow with other Moroccan populations. These genetic factors, together with the lack of sexual reproduction (only vegetative growth via rhizomes has been reported) and high anthropogenic pressures, make the risk of extinction of this species in the Canarian archipelago more likely. Some considerations for future restoration plans for this valuable species are suggested."
