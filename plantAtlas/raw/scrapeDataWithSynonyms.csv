Acaena novae-zelandiae|A prostrate dwarf perennial herb of freely-draining soil, naturalised in sparsely vegetated sites subject to moderate disturbance. Habitats include sand dunes, cliffs, heaths, conifer plantations on sandy soils, old gravel workings, roadsides and disused railways. Reproduction is from seed, and sometimes from pieces of rooted stolon. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was introduced to Britain as a wool contaminant and its spread into semi-natural habitats was often from woollen mills; it was first recorded in the wild in 1901. However, some colonies appear to have resulted from the dumping of garden refuse. It can be very persistent, and its spread continues in some areas.|Native of Australia and New Zealand.
Acer campestre|A deciduous tree, native in woodland, scrub and old hedgerows on a wide range of moist, usually base-rich, soils. It is also widespread as a planted tree in amenity areas, on farmland, along roads and in hedgerows and coppice. It fruits erratically, sometimes producing only male flowers following a year of prolific fruiting. 0-380 m (Llanthony, Brecon).|Native|Since the 1962 Atlas there have been many more records of A. campestre from S.W. England and S. Wales. It has also been very extensively planted both within and beyond its native range, and these introductions tend to blur the boundary of its native range.|European Temperate element.     © S. Hammonds
Acer platanoides|A deciduous tree planted in woodland, hedgerows, amenity areas, gardens and along roads. It tolerates a wide range of soil types and is frequently self-sown, becoming naturalised in secondary woodland, rough grassland, scrub and urban waste land. Generally lowland, but reaching 340 m at Alston (Cumberland).|Neophyte|A. platanoides was in cultivation in Britain by 1683, and has been known from the wild since at least 1905. Trends in its distribution are difficult to assess, but it is probably increasing due to continued planting.|A European Temperate species, absent as a native from much of western Europe.     © S. Hammonds
Acer pseudoplatanus|A large, rapidly growing deciduous tree of plantations, woods, parkland, estates, large gardens and roadsides, prolifically self-sowing and naturalised in a very wide range of natural, semi-natural and man-made habitats, avoiding only the most acidic and waterlogged soils. In upland areas, however, it is often restricted to sites associated with habitation. 0-580 m (Dowgang Hush, Cumberland).|Neophyte|A. pseudoplatanus was introduced to Britain in the 16th century and was widely planted from the late 18th century onwards; it was first recorded from the wild in 1632. There has been little change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|A European Temperate species, mainly found in the mountains of C. & S. Europe.     © P. Shannon
Aceras anthropophorum|This tuberous perennial herb is found in old chalk-pits and limestone quarries, calcareous grassland and on road verges. It tolerates considerable shade and is often found at the edge of scrub with grasses such as Brachypodium pinnatum. Continuous heavy grazing is detrimental, eventually causing its demise. Lowland.|Native|By 1930 most East Anglian populations of this species had been destroyed by ploughing. Similar fates have since eliminated more sites, and others have been lost to scrub encroachment, spray drift and inappropriate roadside cutting regimes. Morphological and molecular (Bateman et al., 1997) evidence suggests that Aceras belongs in the genus Orchis.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © L. Rooney
Achillea millefolium|A perennial herb found in all kinds of grassland habitats, ranging from lawns to montane communities irrigated by melting snow-beds; also found on coastal sand dunes and stabilised shingle, waysides and waste ground. It tolerates drought, and grows in most soils except the most nutrient-poor, permanently waterlogged or strongly acidic. 0-1210 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no significant change in the distribution of A. millefolium since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.     © S. Hammonds
Achillea ptarmica|A perennial herb of damp or wet habitats on a wide range of soils, including fen- and water-meadows, rush-pasture, marshes, streamsides, wet heath, springs and flushes on hill slopes and occasionally in wet woodland. It is also established from cultivation in churchyards, and on roadsides and waste ground. 0-770 m (Cross Fell, Cumberland).|Native|A. ptarmica was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It is now better recorded in some areas, but has declined in others. Analysis of the database reveals that while many losses occurred before 1950, they have accelerated since then; most are due to drainage and habitat destruction.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © S. Hammonds
Aconitum napellus|These tuberous perennial herbs grow on calcareous to slightly acidic soil along stream banks, often in shade, in damp, open woodland and sometimes in damp meadows, and as aliens on roadsides, waste ground and rubbish tips. Generally lowland, but reaching 460 m at Quarnford (Staffs.).|Native|All records of A. napellus sens. str. and A. x cammarum are mapped here. The British A. napellus is regarded as the endemic subsp. napellus, suggesting that it is native, but the species has long been grown in gardens and was not recorded in the wild until 1821. It may be over-recorded as a supposed native in the Welsh Marches.|European Temperate element.
Aconitum napellus sens. lat.||||
Acorus calamus|A rhizomatous perennial herb growing at the margins of streams, canals, ponds and lakes in shallow, nutrient-rich calcareous water. The European plant is a sterile triploid. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. calamus was introduced into England in the 16th century and by 1668 was established in the wild. It appears to be more widespread than when mapped in the 1962 Atlas, probably due to better recording as the plant flowers shyly in our area and may well have been overlooked in the past.|Native plants are diploid (Siberia, N. America) or tetraploid (S. & E. Asia); the origin of the triploid is unknown but it is naturalised in Europe & W. Asia, the Himalayas and eastern N. America.     © P. Shannon
Actaea spicata|A perennial herb of shaded sites on limestone. Its habitats differ superficially, being found in the grikes of limestone pavement, on rock ledges, and in deciduous woodland, but all have the same characteristics of shade, low competition and a cool, protected root run. 0-450 m (Hawkswick Clowder, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|Populations of this species are long-lived and stable. Despite occasional threats such as quarrying or neglect of scrub or woodland causing increased competition, the species maintains its historic range. It is occasionally grown in gardens, and naturalised or relict garden populations can persist for many years.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.     © P. Shannon
Adiantum capillus-veneris|A semi-evergreen fern found in areas with an oceanic climate on wet, calcareous cliffs where its rhizomes are protected in crevices; in the Aran Islands and the Burren (both Co. Clare) it grows in grikes in limestone pavement. Many inland records in sheltered warm sites, such as damp mortared walls, railway sidings and canal locks, arise from spores derived from cultivated plants. Lowland.|Native|In the 19th century, native populations were jeopardised by collectors; many pre-1970 sites were lost before 1930. There have been few recent losses, however, and many more alien records.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; also in C. and E. Asia and N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Adonis annua|An arable weed of dry soils on chalk and limestone, also recorded from tracks, chalk pits and other disturbed habitats. Seed production is low but there is a long-lived soil seed bank. Most populations are small and restricted to field edges. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|This species is known from Iron Age deposits (Jones, 1984). It underwent a catastrophic decline from c. 1880 to 1950, and has been lost from a further 30% of 10-km squares since the 1962 Atlas. This decline is due to improved seed cleaning methods, increased use of agrochemicals and the density of modern crops. Some recent records are deliberate introductions.|Native of the Mediterranean region; long naturalised northwards to Britain.
Adoxa moschatellina|A perennial rhizomatous herb of mesic brown earth soils on the shaded banks of rivers and streams, in deciduous woodlands and shaded hedge banks; also occasionally in shaded base-rich sites in mountains. This is a vernal species which disappears by May or June in the lowlands. It is self-fertile, reproducing by seed and vegetatively. 0-1065 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|Populations of A. moschatellina within old woodlands have remained stable. In some areas A. moschatellina is possibly under-recorded due to its early season. Its native status in Ireland has been questioned (Hackney, 1992).|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Aegopodium podagraria|A rhizomatous perennial herb found in a wide variety of disturbed habitats, especially hedgerows, road verges, churchyards, neglected gardens and waste ground. It typically occurs near habitation or in the vicinity of abandoned settlements, such as in woodlands. It reproduces by seed and by its aggressive rhizome system. 0-450 m (Nenthead, Cumberland).|Archaeophyte|Archaeological evidence suggests that A. podagraria was introduced in Roman times, probably for medicinal and culinary use. There is little change in its range since the 1962 Atlas.|A Eurosiberian Temperate species, certainly native in C. Europe but native limits obscured by its spread in cultivation and as a weed.     © P. Shannon
Aesculus hippocastanum|A tree of parkland, large gardens and estates, churchyards, urban streets and village greens; also a constituent of deciduous and mixed woodland. It is sometimes self-sown in scrubby areas, waste ground or rough grassland, and occasionally regenerates in woodland, but is rarely fully naturalised. Generally lowland, but reaching 505 m at Ashgill (Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species was introduced into cultivation in 1612 or 1615, and was recorded from the wild by 1870. It is now better recorded in S.W. England, Wales and Ireland than in the 1962 Atlas, but its overall range has changed little.|Native of the Balkan peninsula; other species in the family are found in S. & E. Asia and the Americas.     © S. Hammonds
Aethusa cynapium|An annual of hedge banks, waste places, arable fields and other cultivated ground. Lowland.|Native|A. cynapium was first recorded in Britain by 1597. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. The current map indicates losses in N. & W. Britain, and in Ireland, where it is thought to be alien (Scannell & Synnott, 1987). The reasons for these losses are unclear, but analysis of the database reveals that most have taken place since 1950. Two subspecies occur in our area: subsp. cynapium occurs throughout the range of the species; subsp. agrestis is probably an archaeophyte and is most frequent on arable land in S. Britain.|European Temperate element.     © S. Hammonds
Agrimonia eupatoria|A perennial herb of basic and neutral soils, occurring in hedge banks, on woodland margins and rides, in field-borders and open grassland, on roadsides and railway banks, and sometimes in waste places. It reproduces and spreads by seed. 0-365 m (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|The map suggests a slight decline in the distribution of A. eupatoria since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © S. Hammonds
Agrimonia procera|An erect perennial herb found in similar habitats to A. eupatoria, including hedgerows, woodland margins and roadside verges, generally on soils which are neither strongly calcareous nor strongly acidic. 0-335 m (Fortingall, Mid Perth).|Native|A. procera has been much confused in the past with A. eupatoria var. sepium, which can also be glandular and aromatic. The overall range is little changed since the 1962 Atlas. The apparent increases in East Anglia, W. Scotland and elsewhere are probably attributable to recorders` increased familiarity with this species.|European Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Agrostemma githago|An annual weed of cereal and other arable crops, tolerant of various soil types, with its distribution largely mirroring that of the crops in which it grew. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|A. githago, introduced as a grain contaminant, has been present in Britain since the Iron Age. Although common until the 20th century, it has dramatically declined with improved seed cleaning. It is now extinct as an arable weed, but is a frequent component of wild-flower seed mixtures.|Native range uncertain, perhaps the E. Mediterranean region; spread with cultivation throughout temperate and S. Europe and to many other areas.     © L. Rooney
Agrostis canina|A stoloniferous, perennial grass of infertile, acidic, peaty soils in mires, wet heath, fens and fen-meadows, springs and soakways, swamps and water margins. It may exploit vegetation gaps or act as a dominant. It spreads by stolon fragments. 0-1035 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|The map of A. canina in the 1962 Atlas included both this species and A. vinealis. Although these have long been recognised at varietal or subspecific rank, they have only recently been treated as species in British floras (Clapham et al., 1987). A. canina sens. str. is under-recorded in areas for which only records of the aggregate are available.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Agrostis canina sens.lat.||||
Agrostis capillaris|A rhizomatous, occasionally stoloniferous, perennial herb occurring mainly on dry or damp, neutral to moderately acidic soils; its habitats include lowland pastures, hay meadows, upland hill-pasture, heaths, open woodland and scrub, sand dunes and a range of ruderal habitats including areas contaminated by heavy metals. It is extensively used as a lawn grass, on its own or with other species. 0-1210 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no change in the range of A. capillaris since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © S. Hammonds
Agrostis curtisii|A tufted perennial herb of the drier parts of impoverished, sandy and peaty heaths, especially those with impeded drainage, occasionally extending to more consistently waterlogged ground. In closed communities, it occurs as scattered plants, but it can seed prolifically into burnt or disturbed ground and rapidly form an almost continuous cover. It also occurs in open acidic woodland over gravel and sand. Generally lowland, but reaching 610 m on Dartmoor (S. Devon).|Native|A. curtisii has been lost from some 10-km squares on the edges of its range through habitat destruction. However, these losses are balanced to some extent by its ability to colonise open ground rapidly.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Agrostis gigantea|A sprawling, perennial herb, behaving as a rampant weed in cornfields and neglected arable land, particularly on lighter soils, where it spreads by seed and by rhizomes. In wetter habitats, where it is much rarer, it can persist in taller, closed vegetation by rhizomatous growth. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|A. gigantea may have been overlooked in the past, or confused with A. stolonifera. Despite being vulnerable to herbicides, it has shown a marked increase since the 1962 Atlas. It is, however, almost certainly still under-recorded.|As an archaeophyte A. gigantea has a Eurasian Southern-temperate distribution, but it is naturalised in N. America so its distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © P. Shannon
Agrostis stolonifera|A stoloniferous perennial herb, found in many habitats on heavy and light, moist and dry soils. It occurs in permanent grassland (including inundation and brackish communities), in upper saltmarsh and dune-slacks, on sand dunes and sandy flats, on cliffs and in mires, springs, flushes and ditches. It also grows on spoil heaps and a wide range of open and disturbed habitats, and is a weed in arable sites. 0-945 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no change in the range of A. stolonifera since the 1962 Atlas. It is very variable in form and distinct ecotypes have evolved in response to newly available habitats.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Agrostis vinealis|A shortly rhizomatous perennial herb, mainly of dry or free-draining, acidic, sandy or peaty soils on heaths, in acidic grass-heath, in open woodland (especially Betula, Pinus and Quercus), in woodland clearings and on rides. On some lowland heaths A. vinealis may grow in damp situations, but unlike A. canina it avoids waterlogged soils. It is a drought-resistant lawn grass. 0-845 m (Little Dun Fell, Westmorland), and probably higher in Scotland.|Native|Until recently this species was treated as a variety or subspecies of A. canina; it has not been recorded systematically and the existing map is incomplete.|European Temperate element; also in N. America.
Aira caryophyllea|An annual of well-drained sandy and rocky places, cliff-tops, heaths, summer-parched grasslands, anthills and stabilised sand dunes; also on stone walls and railway ballast. Rarely, it is recorded as a wool casual. 0-560 m (Mourne Moutains, Co. Down).|Native|A. caryophyllea was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It appears to have declined throughout its range, especially in S.E. England. Analysis of the database indicates that most of the losses have occurred since 1950.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Aira praecox|An annual of sandy, gravelly and rocky places, commonly on thin acidic soils around rock outcrops, on walls, cliff-tops, heaths and sand dunes. It is rarely recorded as a wool casual. Generally lowland, but reaching 685 m on Mangerton Mountain (S. Kerry).|Native|A. praecox was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It seems to have declined in C. Ireland and England, but not to the extent of A. caryophyllea.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Ajuga chamaepitys|An annual or biennial herb of arable field margins and bare tracks on calcareous soils, and on open chalk downland. Its seeds are long-lived and this has led to its reappearance following disturbance at some sites. Lowland.|Native|Known as a British plant since 1551, A. chamaepitys has declined considerably over the past fifty years due to herbicide spraying, abandonment of fallow land and succession to coarse grassland, scrub and woodland on chalk slopes. It has benefited from conservation management at some sites.|European Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Ajuga pyramidalis|A perennial herb of free-draining slopes, rock crevices and shallow peat in open heathland and grassland overlying moderately acidic, or occasionally neutral or basic, soils. Reproduction is mainly from seed, which is long-lived and often germinates after disturbance. 0-650 m on Ill Bell (Westmorland).|Native|This species has been found in many new sites since the 1962 Atlas, particularly in N. and W. Ireland and remoter areas of Scotland where further populations probably await discovery. Conversely, some sites, such as on Coll (Mid Ebudes), have apparently been lost through more intensive grazing.|European Boreal-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Ajuga reptans|A rhizomatous perennial herb of damp deciduous woods and woodland rides, shaded places and unimproved grassland on neutral or acidic soils, sometimes occurring in flushed ground. 0-760 m on Y Foel-fras (Caerns.).|Native|There is no evidence of an appreciable change in the distribution of A. reptans since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.     © P.

Alchemilla acutiloba|This perennial apomict of neutral grassland is found in unimproved, species-rich hay meadows, or on the margins of meadows which have been re-seeded or are more intensively managed. It is also locally frequent on herb-rich road verges, and occasional on railway banks. From 140 m at Wolsingham to 450 m at Lanehead (both Co. Durham).|Native|There have been local losses of this species from hay fields due to agricultural intensification, and from roadside verges, and partial surveys since 1960 suggest it might have been lost from some of its 10-km squares. It has been naturalised in Lanarkshire since 1992.|European Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Alchemilla alpina|A perennial herb of montane grassland and grass-heath, scree, cliffs, rocky streamsides, rock crevices and ledges. It is found in well-drained habitats, in areas of solifluction and late snow-lie, and sometimes on mountain slopes subject to severe wind-scour. The soils range from acidic to strongly calcareous. It is frequently washed down to lower levels on river gravels. From near sea level in N.W. Scotland to 1270 m on Ben Macdui (S. Aberdeen).|Native|The distribution of A. alpina is stable.|European Arctic-montane element; also in Greenland.
Alchemilla filicaulis||||
Alchemilla glabra|A perennial apomict of grassland habitats, occurring in lowland pasture, hay meadows, grass-heath on hillsides, roadsides and herb-rich banks kept moist by seeping water; also amongst tall vegetation on mountain ledges and in rocky river gorges. A. glabra seems to prefer damp soils, often occurring on stream banks, and in habitats subject to spray or temporary inundation. Lowland to 1215 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no significant change in the distribution of A. glabra since it was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968), but there have been local losses on the southern boundaries of its range.|European Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P.

Alchemilla glaucescens|A perennial herb of limestone grassland and grassy banks by roads and rivers in N. England where it may be locally abundant; also in limestone grassland in Scotland and Ireland. Rarely elsewhere as an escape. Lowland, to 570 m on Whernside (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|There is no change in the distribution of A. glaucescens in England. It was discovered in Berwickshire in 1982. In Ireland the distribution is stable.|European Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Alchemilla glomerulans|A perennial herb, typically found in ungrazed or lightly-grazed base-poor grassy habitats in the C. and N. Scottish mountains; a depauperate form grows in heavily-grazed flushes, and screes below cliffs. In Teesdale and Craven it occurs on roadsides and in species-rich hay meadows. From 145 m near Selkirk (Selkirks.) to 1030 m (Cairngorm Corries, Easterness).|Native|The current distribution of this critical species is unclear, especially in Scotland, because of the shortage of post-1970 records. However, it is unlikely to have disappeared from many of the sites for which there are only pre-1970 records, and there has probably been little change overall.|European Boreo-arctic Montane element; also in N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Alchemilla micans|The largest population of this perennial apomict occurs in species-rich grazed pasture on shallow soil overlying Carboniferous limestone. Small populations have also been recorded from a rough pasture, from tall herbage in an ungrazed hay meadow and from a roadside verge. Lowland.|Native|This species was not recognised in Britain until 1976, and is currently known only from Northumberland. The single record from Durham was made in 1924, and casual plants were recorded in Lanarkshire in 1986 and 1992.|European Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Alchemilla minima|A dwarf perennial herb confined to tightly-grazed, moist, Festuca ovina grassland overlying Carboniferous limestone. From below 300 m to 610 m at Ingleborough (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|This taxon was first recognised as a separate species in 1947. It is a dwarf plant that may have been derived from A. filicaulis by natural selection through centuries of intensive grazing. Its overall distribution is likely to be stable, though new sites continue to be found within its very restricted range.|Endemic.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Alchemilla mollis|A vigorous perennial herb, frequently grown in gardens and found naturalised on roadsides, riverbanks, rough ground and anywhere where garden refuse is dumped. It also occurs as a casual on rubbish tips. It reproduces mainly by seed, which is produced abundantly, but it can also spread by rhizome fragments. Generally lowland, but established at 520 m below Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Neophyte|A. mollis, cultivated in Britain since 1874, was first recorded in the wild in 1948. There has been a massive increase in 10-km square records since the five mapped by Perring & Sell (1968), perhaps reflecting both its increasing popularity in gardens and better recording.|Native of S.E. Europe and S.W. Asia.     © S. Hammonds
Alchemilla monticola|A perennial herb of neutral grassland, occurring in unimproved, species-rich hay meadows, but confined to the margins of those which are intensively managed. It is also locally frequent on road verges, particularly those which support a hay meadow flora. From 150 m (Barnard Castle, N.W. Yorks.) to 450 m (near Harwood Beck, Co. Durham).|Native|Since 1960, partial surveys have shown some losses of this species from hay fields due to the intensification of grass production, and from road verges, and it might now be lost from some 10-km squares for which there is no post-1970 record.|European Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W.

Alchemilla subcrenata|This perennial herb has been recorded in species-rich hay meadows, along the margins of those which are more intensively managed, and from unimproved pasture. The altitude range is c. 270-320 m in Weardale and Teesdale (Co. Durham).|Native|A. subcrenata was first found in 1951, and has only ever been known from a very restricted area of Teesdale, and one site to the north, in Weardale. Since 1990 it has been recorded in only two sites, and a search of three others in 1996 failed to detect it.

Alchemilla vulgaris agg.||||
Alchemilla wichurae|A perennial herb of tightly-grazed base-rich grassland and herb-rich rock ledges on outcrops and cliffs; sometimes colonising damp scree and bare cracks in limestone and basalt. It seems to prefer moist soils, frequently occurring near waterfalls and seepages. From sea level in N. Scotland to 990 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of A. wichurae appears to be more or less stable in England, but in Scotland this is less certain due to the dearth of recent records. It may, however, still be present in many squares for which there are only pre-1970 records.|European Boreal-montane element; also in Greenland.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Alchemilla xanthochlora|This perennial herb of neutral or mildly calcareous grassland occurs in lowland pastures and hay meadows, on upland hill-slopes, in rough grassy places, on river banks and streamsides, woodland borders and rides, and roadside verges. 0-885 m (Caenlochan, Angus).|Native|The distribution of this species is generally stable, but there may have been losses in C. and S. Scotland. This may, however, simply indicate under-recording.|European Temperate element.
Alisma gramineum|An annual or short-lived perennial which grows in shallow, eutrophic water at the edge of lakes, rivers and fenland drains. Populations may arise from buried seed after disturbance. Lowland.|Native|This species maintains a precarious presence in Britain. It was first found at Westwood Great Pool (Worcs.) in 1920 and the River Glen (S. Lincs.) in 1955; at both sites populations vary annually but are usually small and the plant sometimes fails to appear. At the other two sites the species has been found only once, in 1970. Native material has been introduced to new sites.|Circumpolar Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe and a disjunct distribution elsewhere.
Alisma lanceolatum|An emergent perennial herb, found in shallow water or on exposed mud at the edge of a wide range of water bodies, although in many areas it is particularly frequent in canals. It is most frequent in eutrophic, calcareous water and rooted in a fine substrate. Lowland.|Native|A. lanceolatum was not consistently recognised by British botanists as a distinct species until 1952, so distributional trends are difficult to assess. It might still be overlooked as A. plantago-aquatica, but the map may also include erroneous records as narrow-leaved plants of that species are sometimes mis-identified as A. lanceolatum.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element.
Alisma plantago-aquatica|A perennial herb growing on exposed mud at the shallow edge of still or slow-flowing waters, or in marshes and swamps. It is confined to mesotrophic or eutrophic habitats.

Allium cepa|A bulbous perennial herb, widely grown in gardens and also in fields and found as a relic of cultivation or a throw-out on rubbish tips, waysides and waste ground. This species is a fertile diploid. Lowland.|Casual|A. cepa was being cultivated in British gardens by 995 (Harvey, 1981) and is very widely grown as a vegetable crop. It was recorded from the wild by 1927 (Oxon) but probably had a long unrecorded history as a casual before that. The increase in records is doubtless due to better recording of casual aliens rather than a genuine increase in the wild.|Origin uncertain; known from tomb paintings to have been cultivated by the Ancient Egyptians and now widespread as a crop.
Allium oleraceum|A bulbous perennial herb of dry, usually steeply sloping, calcareous grasslands, and on open sunny banks in river floodplains. 0-365 m (Dovedale, Derbys.).|Native|There has undoubtedly been some confusion with A. scorodoprasum in the past. There are now many more records of A. oleraceum than in the 1962 Atlas, although it is perhaps still under-recorded due to difficulties in locating plants in the field from early summer onwards. There are indications of some decline throughout its range.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Allium paradoxum|A bulbous perennial herb, spreading by means of bulbils in a wide variety of, usually ungrazed, situations such as river-banks, roadsides, field margins, other rough and waste ground, and in woodland. Generally lowland, but reaching 375 m at Carter Bar (Roxburghs.).|Neophyte|A. paradoxum was introduced into cultivation in 1823 and was first recorded in the wild near Edinburgh in 1863. It can be very invasive in disturbed habitats, and is increasingly abundant throughout its range, especially in S. Scotland. Its predominantly eastern distribution contrasts with that of A. triquetrum.|Native of the Caucasus and Iran.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Allium roseum|A bulbous perennial herb of rough and waste ground, open rocky slopes, hedge banks and roadsides. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. roseum was introduced into cultivation by 1752, and first recorded in the wild in 1837. Both var. bulbiferum and var. roseum are commonly cultivated in gardens; var. bulbiferum, in which some of the flowers in the umbel are replaced by bulbils, is particularly likely to be naturalised when planted or discarded in suitable habitats. A. roseum is spreading, especially in S.W. England.|A variable species, native of the Mediterranean region.     © L. Rooney
Allium schoenoprasum|A bulbous perennial herb found as a native in a range of habitats, usually on thin soils over limestone, serpentine and basic igneous rocks; it sometimes grows in rank grass on deeper soils, and in crevices of riverside bedrock. As an alien it grows on roadsides and rubbish tips. Lowland.|Native|The overall native distribution of this species is unchanged since the 1962 Atlas, but alien occurrences have increased. It is regarded by Scannell & Synnott (1987) as probably introduced in Ireland, but Curtis & McGough (1988) suggest that it is native on limestone pavement at L. Mask (E. Mayo).|Assigned to the Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element, but with an anomalous distribution; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Allium scorodoprasum|A bulbous, perennial herb spreading mainly by bulbils in rough grassland and waste ground, on road verges and track sides and by railways. It sometimes occurs in more natural habitats such as sandy river banks, open woodlands on well-drained soils and a variety of coastal situations. Lowland.|Native|A. scorodoprasum is much better recorded than it was for the 1962 Atlas, and its distribution seems to be stable.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; widely naturalised outside its native range. Our plant is sometimes considered to be a horticulturally derived variant of the S. European A. scorodoprasum subsp. rotundum.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Allium sphaerocephalon|A bulbous perennial herb found as a possible native at only two localities: on dry, rocky S.- and W.-facing slopes in the Avon Gorge (W. Gloucs.), and on rough, sandy ground by the sea at St. Aubin`s Bay, Jersey. Both populations are very small. Lowland.|Native|or alien. A. sphaerocephalon was first cultivated in Britain in 1759, and was first recorded in the wild in Jersey in 1836 and in the Avon Gorge in 1847, where it is normally thought to be native but may be alien (Lovatt, 1982). Recreational pressure and safety works within the Avon Gorge may have contributed to a gradual decline in recent years. It appears to be stable in Jersey. As it is now widely grown in gardens, it can be expected to spread as an escape.|European Southern-temperate element.
Allium triquetrum|A bulbous perennial herb, spreading by ant-dispersed seed on roadsides, in hedge banks, on field margins and in rough and waste ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. triquetrum was introduced into cultivation by 1759 and noted as established here by 1849, initially in Guernsey. It is now thoroughly naturalised and increasingly abundant and widespread in milder areas with scattered, sometimes short-lived, populations elsewhere. It has considerably increased in numbers and range since it was mapped in the 1962 Atlas.|Native of the W. & C. Mediterranean region.     © P. Shannon
Allium ursinum|A bulbous perennial herb of moist woodlands, sometimes growing in more open situations such as riversides and hedge banks and occasionally in rock crevices, in scree and on coastal cliff ledges. Regeneration is primarily by seed. Generally lowland, but reaching c. 450 m at Great Clowder, Malham (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|There is little evidence of significant distributional change in this species since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Allium vineale|A bulbous perennial herb of dry, neutral or calcareous soils, generally occurring in summer-dry grasslands, hedgerows, roadsides and cultivated ground, and formerly a serious weed of cereal crops in S.E. England. Also found on coastal cliff ledges in W. Scotland. Generally lowland, but reaching 455 m in Wensleydale (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|There is little evidence of change in the range of this species since the 1962 Atlas. There are few available data to assess the relative abundance of the three varieties recognised in our area, although the exclusively floriferous var. capsuliferum appears to be rare.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © S. Hammonds
Alnus glutinosa|A deciduous tree of damp or wet, basic to moderately acidic soils, found beside rivers, streams, canals, lakes and ditches, and in flood plains, fens and bogs, carr and wooded dune-slacks. It can rapidly seed into open sites, producing even-aged stands of mature trees, but seedlings are very shade- and drought-sensitive, so regeneration in woodland is often poor. It is also widely planted. 0-470 m (Garrigill, Cumberland).|Native|The overall distribution of this species is stable. However, a recently evolved Phytophthora fungus has killed 10% of trees in S. England and Wales, and may have a wider impact in the future.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © S. Hammonds
Alnus incana|A deciduous tree, widely planted in parks, on roadsides, reclaimed tips and river banks, and sometimes in small plantations. It is very hardy and tolerant of poor, wet soils, making it useful in amenity planting in the north. It sometimes spreads to, and becomes naturalised on, waste ground and railway embankments. It reproduces by seed and suckering. Lowland.|Neophyte|Introduced to cultivation in Britain in 1780, A. incana was not recorded from the wild until 1922. It is planted with increasing frequency and is probably under-recorded.|A Circumpolar Boreal-montane species, absent as a native from much of W. Europe.     © Mahanova, Alla
Alopecurus aequalis|An annual, most frequent on drying mud but found in a wide variety of habitats associated with freshwater, including the margins of ponds, ditches, reservoirs, turloughs and flooded gravel-pits. It has also recently been found as a weed in aquatic garden centres. Lowland.|Native|A. aequalis has been lost from many suitable sites, but seems readily to colonise new open habitats. Population sizes are very variable, and it may not appear when water levels remain high, possibly leading to under-recording. It may sometimes be overlooked as, or mistaken for, A. geniculatus. It was not discovered in Ireland until 1992.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Alopecurus borealis|A shortly rhizomatous perennial herb, found in oligotrophic springs and flushes, or on their borders, often associated with late snow-beds. It occurs on a wide range of acidic or slightly basic rocks. From 450 m on Widdybank Fell (Durham) to 1220 m on Braeriach (S. Aberdeen).|Native|This species has not only been recorded at new localities within its existing range since the 1962 Atlas, but has also been found in new areas of C. Scotland. It is an inconspicuous grass, especially as it is shy-flowering and any inflorescences produced are often grazed off.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element; in Europe restricted to Britain, Svalbard, arctic Russia and the Urals.     © Pete Stroh
Alopecurus bulbosus|A perennial herb of periodically flooded brackish grassland in unimproved coastal grazing marshes, at the edges of ditches and in trampled ground at the base of sea walls; also locally in the uppermost parts of saltmarshes. Lowland.|Native|The 1962 Atlas suggested a marked decline of this species, but it was much under-recorded until the 1980s, and is now known to be still present (and sometimes abundant) at many sites from which it was thought to have been lost. Nevertheless, many populations have declined due to drainage and improvement of its habitat. Where salinity is reduced by sea-defence schemes it readily hybridises with A. geniculatus and eventually disappears, leaving the hybrid behind.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Alopecurus geniculatus|A perennial herb, rooting at the nodes, which is frequent in fertile sites which are flooded in winter such as muddy ditch-sides, wet arable fields, pond margins and grazing marshes. It readily colonises bare mud and disturbed areas, where it can become very lush, but avoids both the most acidic and the most alkaline sites. Generally lowland, but reaching 595 m on Highfield (S. Northumb.), and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|The range of A. geniculatus is probably stable, and has not significantly changed since the 1962 Atlas.|European Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © S. Hammonds
Alopecurus myosuroides|An annual of rank and neglected grassland and arable land, rapidly increasing by seed to become a pest, particularly of cereal crops. It grows on both light and heavy soils. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|A. myosuroides has maintained, or slightly increased, its core distribution since the 1962 Atlas. It is still a frequent and troublesome weed of arable land. Some strains have evolved specific resistance to several commonly used herbicides, especially in E. Britain, and the species has benefited from the increased planting of winter cereal crops and the decline of stubble burning.|As an archaeophyte A. myosuroides has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © Mahanova, Alla
Alopecurus pratensis|A tufted perennial herb of a wide range of grasslands, particularly those with moist, fertile soils. It also occurs on roadsides and woodland margins. It avoids waterlogged habitats, and is absent from light and dry soils, including arable fields. Generally lowland, but reaching 610 m on Ettrick Pen (Dumfriess.), and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|A. pratensis was frequently sown in seed mixtures up to 1950. Many local strains still occur, particularly in pastures that have not been re-sown recently. Its distribution is stable.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.     © S. Hammonds
Althaea hirsuta|An annual, or rarely biennial, herb naturalised on open, dry calcareous soils, particularly on S.-facing slopes, and in woodland. The long-lived seed requires disturbance for germination, and populations are subject to marked annual fluctuations in numbers. It also occurs as a casual on waste ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was cultivated in Britain by 1683. There are a few long-lived populations; it has been known from Kent since 1792 and is sometimes considered native there and in Oxfordshire and Somerset. Another persistent population in Lincolnshire probably originated from pheasant food.|A European Southern-temperate species, occurring throughout the Mediterranean region and in Europe north to Slovakia.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Althaea officinalis|A perennial herb of coastal habitats, growing on the banks of ditches containing brackish water, in brackish pastures, and in the transition zone between the upper saltmarsh and freshwater habitats. It is intolerant of grazing and cutting. It also occurs as a garden escape. Lowland.|Native|A. officinalis has declined throughout most of its British range, due to drainage and development in the coastal zone. Much of the loss occurred before 1930, but it has continued since then, particularly in East Anglia.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Amaranthus albus|An annual of disturbed, nutrient-rich waste ground and rubbish tips, predominantly casual and very rarely naturalised. It is introduced with fibre, grain, oil- and bird-seed, and with bark for tanning. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. albus has been cultivated in Britain since 1778. It was recorded in the wild in 1872, and Dunn (1905) described it as a `rare casual weed in England`.|Native of N. America; widely naturalised in temperate and southern Europe and elsewhere.
Amaranthus retroflexus|An annual of disturbed, nutrient-rich waste ground, waysides, rubbish tips and cultivated land, usually casual but occasionally persisting in milder areas. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. retroflexus was known in gardens by 1759, and escapes, of which the earliest on record was in 1853, have been reinforced by introductions with shoddy, bird-seed and soya-bean waste. Dunn (1905) described it as `now very common in most parts of Europe, including England`, but later changes in distribution are unclear.|Native of temperate and tropical America; naturalised throughout much of temperate and southern Europe and in other continents.     © Mahanova, Alla
Ammophila arenaria|A rhizomatous perennial herb of coastal sand dunes. A. arenaria is an important species in the stabilisation of mobile dunes and blow-outs, and is widely planted as a sand binder. Inland, it is a rare casual, though several attempts have been made in recent years to establish it on inland golf courses. Lowland.|Native|There is no evidence of appreciable change in the distribution of A. arenaria since the 1962 Atlas. Introductions inland and the widespread planting of A. arenaria on eroding dunes have had little impact on its overall distribution.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P.

Amsinckia micrantha|An annual weed of arable land and waste ground. It is sometimes an abundant or even pernicious weed on light, sandy soils. It arises as a contaminant of grain and from wool shoddy. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. micrantha was first cultivated in Britain in 1836, but was not recorded from the wild until later, in 1910, when it was introduced as a seed impurity. It has increased steadily since the 1950s, and is clearly much more frequent now than formerly. It has been confused with A. lycopsoides.|Native of western N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Anacamptis pyramidalis|A tuberous perennial herb of well-drained calcareous soils. It is found in shortly grazed downland, dune-slacks and on cliff-tops, and also in the longer grass of semi-stable dunes, scrub, roadside verges and churchyards. It also grows in the grikes of limestone pavement, and can colonise the disturbed ground of abandoned quarries, industrial waste land and railway embankments. 0-350 m (Brough, Westmorland).|Native|The overall distribution of this species is stable, although it has been lost from some sites, particularly in Ireland, largely due to agricultural improvement.|European Southern-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Anagallis arvensis|A winter-annual or, occasionally, a short-lived perennial. A. arvensis is common in open habitats as an arable or garden weed, and also grows around rabbit warrens and in rocky and bare sites including coastal cliffs, chalk downland, heaths and sand dunes. 0-320 m (Co. Dublin).|Native|A. arvensis was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There have been losses in the north of its range, but it is difficult to say when they occurred. The native subsp. arvensis occurs throughout the range of the species. Subsp. foemina is mapped separately.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © P. Shannon
Anagallis minima|An annual of open places on damp, sandy sites, often near the sea and usually on acidic soils. Habitats include sand dunes, sandy cliffs, along paths and tracks on heathland, and in forest rides. It is a poor competitor where grazing is relaxed and general disturbance ceases. Lowland.|Native|Many sites, especially inland ones, were lost before 1930. In England these losses have continued or accelerated, possibly through changes in heathland management, but the distribution is stable elsewhere. It is also very easily overlooked, and is probably under-recorded.|European Temperate element; also in N. America and widely naturalised outside its native range.
Anagallis tenella|A creeping, evergreen perennial of wet open sites. In S. and E. Britain it is mostly restricted to bare soil or bryophyte mats in calcareous dune-slacks and short-sedge fens, and sometimes on acidic bogs. In the west it also occurs in a variety of soligenous and peaty mires, hillside flushes and rush-pastures, and relying on cattle, sheep or periodic flooding to keep sites open. 0-610 m (Buck of Cabrach, N. Aberdeen).|Native|This species was lost from many 10-km squares in S. & E. England before 1930. Since then, further sites have been lost to grassland improvement, eutrophication and drainage. The distribution is stable elsewhere.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Anaphalis margaritacea|A rhizomatous perennial herb established on waste ground and short grassland, especially roadside verges, lane- and railway-sides, coal mine slag-heaps and in open areas in woodland. Generally lowland, but reaching 410 m at Eisteddfa Gurig (Cards.).|Neophyte|A. margaritacea was being grown in British gardens by 1596. It was first recorded in the wild before 1709, when it was already well-naturalised along the Rhymney River, Glamorgan. There has been little change in overall distribution since the 1962 Atlas, although there are more additional scattered records and it has consolidated its range in S. Wales.|Native of N. America and N.E. Asia; widely naturalised in N. & C. Europe.
Anchusa arvensis|This annual weed is mostly found on well-drained soils in arable fields, but it also occurs near the sea on sandy heaths, in disturbed dunes and on waste ground. Lowland, but with a casual record at 420 m near Ballater (S. Aberdeen).|Archaeophyte|A. arvensis was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, and analysis of the database reveals that most of the losses have occurred since 1950. The main cause has been agricultural intensification, including the increased use of herbicides.|As an archaeophyte A. arvensis has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Andromeda polifolia|A straggling dwarf shrub of moist to wet acidic peaty ground, most abundant in lowland raised bogs but with scattered occurrences on upland peats. Fruits seldom develop. From sea level to c. 530 m in Wales and England, with an outlying site at 735 m on Mt Keen (S. Aberdeen).|Native|A. polifolia was lost from some sites before 1930 and its habitat has declined greatly in the last fifty years through drainage, peat extraction and afforestation. However, it remains frequent in undrained sites. Many sites have been discovered since the 1962 Atlas, mainly in Wales and the Clyde Basin.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Anemone nemorosa|A rhizomatous perennial, found in woodland, on streamsides, under Pteridium, on hedge banks, in heathy grassland, on open moorland, in scree and on limestone pavement. It has a wide pH tolerance, but in woodlands it is most abundant where the vigour of more competitive species is reduced by acidity, waterlogging or regular coppicing. 0-1190 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of A. nemorosa is stable at the 10-km square scale. Double-flowered cultivars and various colour forms are widely cultivated and occasionally escape into the wild, although not all native populations are white-flowered.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © P.

Angelica sylvestris|A perennial herb, occurring on base-enriched soils in a wide variety of habitats, including damp woods and carr, damp neutral grassland, marshes, mires, swamps and tall-herb fens, sea-cliffs, ungrazed montane grassland and mountain ledges. Reproduction is by seed. 0-855 m (Helvellyn, Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of A. sylvestris is stable.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Anisantha diandra|An annual of arable fields, waste ground and roadsides, and in open grassland and heathland on sandy soils. It is sometimes well-established on dunes. A. diandra is a grain, bird-seed and wool alien. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. diandra was introduced to Britain, apparently from Morocco, in 1804 and was first recorded from the wild in 1835 (Fife). In the 1962 Atlas it was treated as possibly native in the Channel Islands, though native status there is now considered most unlikely. It has increased in S. England since 1962, and has considerably consolidated its distribution in East Anglia.|Native of the Mediterranean region and S.W. Asia; naturalised in W. Europe, N. & S. America, S. Africa and elsewhere.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Anisantha rigida|An annual of waysides, open grassland and disturbed or cultivated ground on light soils, usually not persisting but well-established on sand dunes and other sandy places near the sea in S. England and the Channel Islands. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. rigida is a wool, grain and agricultural seed alien, and was first recorded in the wild in 1834. It has previously been treated as native in the Channel Islands, although it is more likely to have been introduced there. It has increased since the 1962 Atlas, although it may have been confused in some areas with A. diandra.|Native of the Mediterranean region; closely related to and perhaps only subspecifically distinct from A. diandra.
Anisantha sterilis|An annual of roadsides, railway banks, open grassland, gardens and waste ground. It can be a serious weed in fields where winter cereals are grown repeatedly using minimum cultivation techniques, especially in S. Britain (Grime et al., 1988). A. sterilis has frequently been introduced with wool shoddy.

Anogramma leptophylla|A small fern found on moist but well-drained shady lane banks, especially where granite is used to support the bank. It prefers bare soil where some surface erosion reduces competition. It is the only British fern with an annual sporophyte; its spores mature early (usually April) and plants die soon afterwards. Its prothallus, however, is perennial and may over-winter in warm crevices to produce new sporophytes the following year. Lowland.|Native|Populations of A. leptophylla vary in size yearly. They are highly vulnerable to the scraping of lane banks by passing traffic and to over-enthusiastic hedgebank management.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; widespread in N. America.
Antennaria dioica|A shortly stoloniferous perennial herb of thin, basic to mildly acidic soils. Its lowland habitats include chalk and limestone grassland, heathland, coastal cliff-tops, sand dunes and machair. In upland areas, habitats include rock ledges, crags, streamsides, screes, well-drained acidic grasslands, heathy pastures and dwarf-shrub heaths. 0-885 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|A. dioica declined markedly in the century before the 1962 Atlas, and there have been further losses since then. Most losses are due to the ploughing of its habitats, or to intensification of grassland management.

Anthemis arvensis|An aromatic annual of light calcareous or sandy soils, growing in arable fields, especially cereals; also in leys, field-borders and waste places, and on roadsides and disturbed ground near the sea. It is occasionally introduced as a contaminant of grass-seed or in wild-flower seed mixtures. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|This species declined substantially in the 20th century, and especially since the 1962 Atlas.

Many northern occurrences are casual.|As an archaeophyte A. arvensis has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Anthemis cotula|A foetid annual of cereals and other arable crops. In some areas it favours heavy soils, including clay, clay-loam and marl, being replaced by A. arvensis on lighter soils, but it can grow on light soils, including those over chalk. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|A. cotula has probably been a serious weed of crops since the Iron Age. Although fairly resistant to the first phenoxy herbicides, it has been much reduced by more recent ones.

Anthoxanthum aristatum|This annual was formerly a persistent weed of cereal crops on sandy or gravelly soils in S.E. England and East Anglia, but is now found only as a rare casual of cultivated ground and in waste places, and around paper mills and dock quaysides. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. aristatum is thought to have been introduced from France in the latter half of the 19th century as an impurity in fodder-plant seed. It was first recorded in the wild in 1872. Its decline was noticeable in the 1962 Atlas, with many losses before 1930. This decline is probably due to improved grain-cleaning techniques, which have reduced its incidence as an arable weed.|Native of S. Europe; widespread as a naturalised or casual introduction further north.
Anthoxanthum odoratum|A short-lived perennial herb which occurs in a wide variety of grassland habitats, including old pastures and meadows, hill grassland, heaths, the drier parts of mires and on sand dunes. It is most frequent on acidic soils, and avoids drought-prone or waterlogged sites. Reproduction is by seed. 0-1030 m (Cairngorms).|Native|A. odoratum was, until the 1920s, a component of grass-seed mixtures, but is no longer sown and has been lost from many pastures that have been improved.

Anthriscus caucalis|An annual of open habitats on well-drained, mainly sandy or gravelly soils, including dry grassland, hedge banks, roadsides, sea-walls, waste ground, gravel-pits and arable fields. Lowland.|Native|Although many sites for A. caucalis were lost before 1930, especially in S. England, its distribution has stabilised since the 1962 Atlas.

Anthriscus sylvestris|A robust perennial herb, characteristic of roadsides and hedgerows, but also occurring in abandoned pastures and under-managed hay meadows, in woodland rides and edges, on railway banks, and on waste and cultivated ground. Very wet or dry habitats are avoided. Seedlings are sometimes plentiful but extension of colonies also occurs by offsets from the main stems. 0-760 m (Mt Brandon, S. Kerry) and 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of A. sylvestris at the 10-km square scale since the 1962 Atlas, but it may have become more frequent on roadsides because of changes in management (e.g. Killick et al., 1998).|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.
Anthyllis vulneraria|A perennial herb of rock outcrops and open turf on S.-facing slopes, on free-draining neutral to base-rich, often calcareous, soils. On the coast it is found on sea-cliffs, shingle and sand dunes. It is increasing as an alien on roadsides. Generally lowland, but reaching 945 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|The native distribution is stable. Five subspecies are known in our area; subsp. vulneraria is found throughout the range of the species, subsp. polyphylla is a sporadic alien, subsp. corbierei is found on a few sea-cliffs and subsp. carpatica and subsp. lapponica are mapped separately.|European Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P.

Antirrhinum majus|An annual or short-lived perennial herb, widely naturalised on old walls, waysides, pavement cracks, waste ground and rubbish tips. Populations can be long-lived, and the species reproduces readily from seed. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. majus has been cultivated here since Elizabethan times and is very popular in gardens. It was first recorded in the wild in 1762. Its distribution has increased significantly since the 1962 Atlas and this is probably due to a genuine spread as well as the better recording of aliens.|Native of the S.W. Europe and the W. Mediterranean region.
Apera interrupta|An annual predominantly found in arable fields, where it can be a weed, but also recorded from road verges, trackways and quarries. It has a more permanent niche in some tightly grazed grassy or grass-heath habitats. It occurs in waste ground as a casual from wool shoddy and imported aggregates, and as a seed impurity. Lowland.|Neophyte|The distribution of A. interrupta, which was first recorded in the wild in 1848, seems to be stable or even increasing, at least at the 10-km square scale.

In all these places, the cover of perennial species is restricted by disturbance or summer drought. 0?610 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|There is no change in the overall distribution of this aggregate, which includes both A. arvensis and A. australis, since the 1962 Atlas. Vegetative plants cannot be assigned with confidence to the segregates, and some recorders have not distinguished fruiting material of the two species. Intermediates also occur and are also mapped here.|The distribution of the two species in this aggregate is given in their respective accounts.
Aphanes australis|A winter- or, less frequently, spring-germinating annual of acidic, sandy or gravelly soils in woodland rides, on sand dunes, in sand- and gravel-pits, on tracks and roadside verges; also found in dry rocky places. It tends to replace A. arvensis on less fertile and more acidic soils. Generally lowland, but reaching 380 m at Loch Lee, Glen Esk (Angus).|Native|The distribution of this species is little changed from that shown in Perring & Sell (1968), although it is now much better recorded.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Apium graveolens|A biennial or monocarpic perennial herb found on sea-walls, beside brackish ditches, on tidal river banks and drift lines, and the uppermost parts of saltmarshes. Inland it occurs on disturbed ground in marshes, by ponds and ditches and occasionally in gravel-pits. Lowland.|Native|Many inland sites for A. graveolens were lost before 1930. The coastal distribution shows a slight decline since the 1962 Atlas, especially in Sussex.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Apium inundatum|This perennial herb occurs in permanent shallow water in streams, ditches, ponds, canals and backwaters, and in sites which are subject to periodic desiccation, such as the edges of lakes, pools, reservoirs and dune-slacks. It is confined to oligotrophic or mesotrophic habitats, and most sites are base-poor. Reproduction is by seed. 0?500 m (Cronkley Fell, N.W. Yorks.).|Native|The considerable decline of A. inundatum in Britain, which has continued since the 1962 Atlas, is the result of the destruction of shallow water bodies, drainage and eutrophication. Trends in Ireland are difficult to assess.|Suboceanic Temperate element.
Apium nodiflorum|A perennial herb, found in shallow water in streams, ditches, swamps and marshes, and on seasonally exposed mud at the edges of ponds, lakes, rivers and canals, sometimes scrambling into nearby vegetation. It is characteristic of nutrient-enriched sites. Generally lowland, but reaching 335 m E. of Shap (Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of this species is stable. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There has been confusion between this species and Berula erecta, particularly in S. Scotland where some of the older records may be erroneous.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Apium repens|A creeping perennial herb of damp meadows and shallow water in ditches and ponds, generally at sites subject to winter flooding. At Port Meadow (Oxon) it grows in disturbed, shortly-grazed neutral grassland and adjacent open soil, where trampling by horses and cattle keeps the habitat open. Seed is produced by plants that escape grazing. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of A. repens has long been uncertain because of confusion with morphologically similar forms of A. nodiflorum and hybrids between them. Genetic studies in the 1990s have confirmed its presence at Port Meadow. All records outside Oxfordshire require confirmation.|European Temperate element.
Aquilegia vulgaris|Native populations of this perennial are found on calcareous soil over limestone rocks in England and Wales. It typically grows in woodland glades and open scrub, by woodland rides and streamsides, in damp grassland and fen, and on scree slopes. Garden escapes can be naturalised in quarries, on roadsides, railway banks and old walls. 0-470 m (Sandbed Gill, Cumberland).|Native|A. vulgaris has increased since the 1962 Atlas, presumably because of the increasing frequency of garden escapes. The native distribution is now totally obscured and all records are mapped as if they were native.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Arabidopsis thaliana|This winter-annual is a pioneer species, intolerant of competition, which is found on rocky ground, dunes and other open sandy or calcareous habitats. It is also very frequent as a weed in gardens and nurseries, and on all sorts of waste ground, especially by railways. 0-850 m (Meall nan Tarmachan, Mid Perth).|Native|The range of A. thaliana is stable. Because of its small genome, rapid growth and copious seed production, it is a fundamental research plant and the subject of a multi-national genome project.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.
Arabis alpina|A perennial, mat-forming herb of shaded ledges on basic cliffs. It is also a very rare garden escape. The native populations are montane, growing at 820-850 m (N. Ebudes).|Native|A. alpina was discovered in Britain in 1887, and the population at the original site on Skye has generally remained stable. A second population has recently been found in the same area. The Somerset alien site is on an old wall, where it has possibly persisted since c. 1900. In Yorkshire it survives in small quantity on a limestone scar on Reginald Farrar`s former estate.|Eurosiberian Arctic-montane element; also in N. America.
Arabis glabra|A biennial, rarely perennial, herb of grassy places and on disturbed ground on free-draining sandy soils over chalk and limestone. Lowland.|Native|A. glabra has declined in many areas, with most of the losses occurring before 1930. Since open ground is required for germination, it will not survive when the habitat becomes overgrown. However, the seed seems to be long-lasting, so populations have the potential to reappear on newly opened ground, and in Breckland it is thriving in disturbed areas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.
Arabis hirsuta|A biennial or perennial herb growing in dry, sunny, exposed situations on rock outcrops and in grassland on base-rich substrates, particularly chalk and limestone; also occurring on sand dunes and on bridges and walls. 0-1005 m (Aonach Beag, Westerness).|Native|A. hirsuta is still widespread in many habitats. Many of the losses were before 1950, probably largely as a result of agricultural improvement, and these have continued, particularly in S.E. England.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Arabis petraea|A perennial herb of very open sites on acidic and basic rocks and rock ledges, on montane cliff faces and screes and on sea-cliffs. It is also found on river shingle and on serpentine fellfield in Shetland. Being a colonist of open habitats, populations can be transient at particular sites, and the species has a curiously disjunct distribution. From near sea level (Shetland) to at least 1220 m (Braeriach, S. Aberdeen).|Native|It is difficult to assess trends in the frequency of this species, as it may still be present in some of the squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|Eurasian Arctic-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Arabis scabra|A short-lived perennial herb of Carboniferous limestone, growing in shallow soils, on scree, and on rock ledges. It spreads by seed. Lowland.|Native|A. scabra has been known in the Avon Gorge since 1686. Although invasion of scrub and wire-netting to prevent rock falls have eliminated some sites, and reduced the open ground needed for germination, populations are still healthy. Introductions elsewhere have proved to be short-lived failures, except those at Combwich (S. Somerset).|Mediterranean-montane element.
Arbutus unedo|A small tree found as a native in heathy scrub and open woodland on rocky slopes and lake shores, on limestone, conglomerate, slates and sandstones; typically on very shallow soil, or rooted into rock. It also occurs as an escape from cultivation, and has become invasive at the Great Orme (Caerns.) and possibly elsewhere. Reproduction is by seed. Lowland.|Native|A. unedo was much more abundant in Ireland several centuries ago, but by the 16th century seemed to have become extinct or rare except in Co. Cork and Co. Kerry, probably largely because of its use for charcoal. There has been little change over the last hundred years.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © P. Shannon
Arctium lappa|A monocarpic perennial herb of streamsides and river banks, roadside verges, tracks and waysides, field-borders, waste land and other disturbed places. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|A. lappa was probably over-recorded in the 1962 Atlas because `Arctium lappa` was used as the name of the Arctium aggregate at that time. The distribution seems stable. It may only be a recent colonist outside its core area in England, and may be increasing.|As an archaeophyte A. lappa has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.
Arctium minus||||
Arctostaphylos alpinus|A strictly calcifugous shrub growing on acidic mineral soils or peat. It occurs on exposed upland heath, and in the northern Highlands of Scotland also on drier blanket bog. It is possibly long-lived, and fruiting is often sparse. It mostly occurs at mid-elevations, but descends to 100 m in North Roe (Shetland) and ascends to 945 m on Tom a`Choinich above Glen Affric (Easterness).|Native|The distribution of A. alpina has probably remained essentially unchanged over recent decades, and it probably still occurs in many of the squares for which there are only pre-1970 records.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.     © S. Ward
Arctostaphylos uva-ursi|This procumbent low shrub is found on upland heaths and moorlands, often over well-drained gravelly or rocky ground, and on ravine sides. It sometimes grows in heathy grasslands on limestone, as in the Burren. From sea level in W. Ireland and Ardtoe (Westerness) to c. 710 m (Rannoch Moor, Mid Perth) and reportedly at 915 m in Inverness-shire.|Native|The range of A. uva-ursi is essentially unchanged since 1950, but it has suffered local declines, possibly because of moor-burning. Most losses in England took place before 1930.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Arenaria ciliata|This low-growing perennial calcicole is found in open mountain grassland and on N.-facing Carboniferous limestone cliffs in the Ben Bulben range in Co. Sligo, at altitudes of 400-600 m.|Native|The population appears to have been stable since it was first recorded in 1806.|European Arctic-montane element; also in Greenland.
Arenaria norvegica||||
Arenaria serpyllifolia|A winter- or rarely summer-annual of dry, usually shallow, neutral to basic soils. It is found in a wide range of open habitats, including rock outcrops, cliffs, screes, walls, spoil heaps from mines and in quarries, railway ballast, waysides and arable field margins. Generally lowland, but reaching at least 610 m at Melmerby Fell (Cumberland).|Native|There appears to be no appreciable change since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Armeria arenaria|A perennial herb of fixed sand dunes and coastal headlands. It has a more inland distribution than A. maritima subsp. maritima, and rarely grows with it. It is also recorded as a casual. Lowland.|Native|In our area A. arenaria is known as a native only in Jersey. There has been no change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Armeria maritima|A perennial herb of sea-cliffs, stone walls, stabilised shingle and saltmarshes. Inland, it grows on montane rock ledges, stony flushes and windswept moss-heaths, around old lead workings and other metalliferous mine wastes, and on riverside shingle. It also occurs inland beside salt-treated roads and as a garden escape. 0-1270 m (Ben Nevis, Westerness).|Native|There has been little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`, apart from its appearance from the 1980s on roadsides, mainly in S. England. Almost all British and Irish plants are referable to subsp. maritima; the rare subsp. elongata is mapped separately.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element.     © P. Shannon
Armoracia rusticana|A long-lived perennial herb, persisting in old gardens and allotments and spreading by root fragments to roadsides, waste ground, railways, sandy seashores and river-banks. The plant is highly sterile, and seed-set is unknown in our area. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|A. rusticana was introduced before 1500, initially as a medicinal herb, but by 1650 it had replaced Lepidium latifolium as a vegetable cultivated for hot relishes. It spreads wherever there is cultivation or dumping of soil, but its range now seems to be stable.|Not known in the wild; naturalised throughout temperate Europe, whence it has spread to N. America and elsewhere.     © P. Shannon
Arnoseris minima|An annual weed of cornfields or fallow ground on the most infertile, acidic, sandy soils. It was particularly associated with soils over Lower Greensand. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Although widely scattered in the 18th and 19th centuries, A. minima was probably persistent only in E. & S.E. England. It declined from the start of the 20th century and by 1953 was limited to about twelve localities. Except for a deliberate introduction in E. Suffolk, it has not been recorded since 1971. Its decline was due to the increased use of fertilisers and herbicides, and improved seed screening methods.|As an archaeophyte A. minima has a European Temperate distribution.
Arrhenatherum elatius|A tufted perennial grass found in a very wide range of neutral to base-rich habitats. It is frequent in grasslands, but is especially common on road verges, hedge banks, and river banks. It is an important stabiliser of limestone scree, and a coloniser of bare, muddy, calcareous cliffs and maritime shingle. Var. bulbosum is widely distributed on roadside banks and as an arable weed on light soils. 0-550 m (E. Perth).|Native|The distribution of A. elatius is similar to that mapped in the 1962 Atlas. Var. bulbosum is still frequent in arable fields, and is encouraged by current direct drilling practices.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Artemisia absinthium|An aromatic perennial herb of waste and rough ground, waysides, railway sidings, rubbish tips, gravel-pits, quarries and other anthropogenic habitats. 0-370 m (Teesdale, Co. Durham).|Archaeophyte|This species, which was being grown in British gardens by 1200 (Harvey, 1981), was formerly cultivated for medicine and flavouring. It is often persistent, especially in urban and maritime locations where it is less at risk from frost damage, and the distribution is more or less stable.|As an archaeophyte A. absinthium has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © P. Shannon
Artemisia campestris|A perennial herb found in the Breckland in short open grassland, grass-heath, on forest rides and tracks, in abandoned arable fields, and on roadsides. It does not persist in tall, closed turf but sometimes reappears following disturbance. Lowland.|Native|Many sites of A. campestris have been lost to agriculture, forestry or building development. It is extant at only three native sites, but alien populations have been established using native seed. It is vulnerable to grazing, and native populations survive only in rabbit exclosures. The naturalised population on sand dunes in Glamorgan appears to be in decline.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Artemisia norvegica|A small rhizomatous perennial of mountain tops, usually occurring in exposed situations on or near the summit ridge. Habitats include bare stony ground, Racomitrium heath, bouldery crests of solifluction terraces, and sometimes hollows between rocks. The relative importance of sexual and vegetative reproduction in British populations is uncertain. 700-870 m (Seana Bhraigh, E. Ross).|Native|This species was discovered in 1950 in W. Ross, and subsequently at two additional sites in the same vice-county. Its populations fluctuate in size, but appear to be stable in the longer term.|European Arctic-montane element; rare in the Arctic zonobiome and absent from mountains of C. Europe.
Artemisia vulgaris|A tall aromatic perennial herb of waste places, tips, rough ground, roadside verges and waysides, usually on relatively fertile soils. The seeds, lacking a pappus, are often distributed by human activities, especially in urban areas and along road and rail systems. Generally lowland, but reaching 350 m north of Shap summit (Westmorland), and with an unlocalised record of 420 m in Aberdeenshire.|Archaeophyte|The distribution of this species appears to be stable.|As an archaeophyte A. vulgaris has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Arum italicum|A rhizomatous perennial found in woodlands, hedge banks, scrub and field-borders. It prefers shaded, humid environments and a deep, well-drained soil reasonably rich in nutrients. Reproduction is by division of the rootstock; only subsp. italicum sets abundant seed. It also occurs as a garden escape. Lowland.|Native|The native distribution of A. italicum is probably stable, although alien occurrences may be increasing. The two subspecies found in our area, the native subsp. neglectum and the alien subsp. italicum, are mapped separately.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Arum maculatum|A rhizomatous perennial herb of woodlands, hedgerows and other shaded areas on moist, well-drained and reasonably fertile soils. Generally lowland, but reaching 425 m at Ystradfellte (Brecs.).|Native|The distribution of A. maculatum shows little change since the 1962 Atlas. There has undoubtedly been some loss caused by hedgerow removal but this has been compensated for by its ability to establish itself quickly in new areas of suitable habitat such as scrub and plantations. Local floras suggest that A. maculatum is alien north of S. Northumberland and Cumbria.|European Temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Asparagus officinalis||||
Asparagus officinalis subsp.officinalis|A dioecious, rhizomatous perennial herb of freely-draining sandy soils. A. officinalis subsp. officinalis readily becomes naturalised, probably mainly by bird-dispersed seed, on grassy heaths and dunes. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|A. officinalis subsp. officinalis was cultivated in Britain in Roman times. It is now widely grown commercially and in gardens. Since the 1962 Atlas, records of subsp. officinalis have increased considerably, perhaps reflecting a genuine increase combined with better recording.|A Eurosiberian Temperate taxon; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Asparagus officinalis subsp.prostratus||||
Asperula cynanchica|A rhizomatous perennial herb of dry, calcareous grasslands and sand dunes. 0-305 m (Burren, Co. Clare).|Native|This species has undergone a substantial decline in some eastern parts of its range since the 1962 Atlas as a result of the ploughing or improvement of its calcareous grassland habitat, and the neglect of what remains. Populations elsewhere are probably relatively stable, although the species is still declining in some limestone areas as, for example, in Oxfordshire (Killick et al., 1998). There are two subspecies in our area: subsp. cynanchica is found throughout the range of the species; subsp. occidentalis has been recorded from Alderney, Dorset, S. Wales and W. Ireland.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Asplenium adiantum-nigrum|This evergreen perennial fern occurs on a wide range of well-drained, usually basic substrates, in lightly shaded habitats where there is little competition. It is found on cliffs and screes, in quarries, on lane banks and walls. Generally lowland, but reaching 575 m at Moor House (Westmorland) and possibly higher in the Cairngorms.|Native|The distribution of this species appears to be stable. Several variants, one previously confused with the C. European A. cuneifolium, are present in the British Isles. They cannot be distinguished on purely edaphic grounds (pace Page, 1997) and are the subject of ongoing research.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia and N. America.
Asplenium adiantum-nigrum sens.lat.||||
Asplenium marinum|An evergreen perennial fern, predominantly found in cool, moist crevices and fissures in maritime cliffs, and often within range of sea-spray. It occasionally grows on walls in coastal areas, but, because of its requirement for a frost-free environment, it is only exceptionally found on rocks inland. Lowland.|Native|Most of the British sites lacking a post-1970 record were lost before 1930, and the distribution of this species is currently stable.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © O.L. Pescott
Asplenium obovatum|This perennial, evergreen, calcifuge fern is mainly a plant of sheltered, shady crevices and ledges on maritime cliffs and on rock outcrops. It also occurs on well-drained, acidic, loamy lane banks and dry-stone walls. Most of its sites are near the sea, and the plant is not vigorous in its colder inland sites. Lowland.|Native|A. obovatum was lost before 1930 from most of the sites which lack a post-1970 record, and its distribution is probably stable.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Asplenium onopteris|An evergreen perennial fern of dry, warm, lightly shaded, usually basic, earthy banks and rock faces in open deciduous woodland. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of this species needs detailed study. It was treated as part of the A. adiantum-nigrum complex in the 1962 Atlas. A. adiantum-nigrum (a polyploid derived in part from A. onopteris) and A. onopteris freely hybridise (A. x ticinense); hybrid populations, and extreme forms of A. adiantum-nigrum, are likely to have produced recording errors.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; it reaches its northern limit in Ireland where it is morphologically invariable, in contrast to the variation shown in the Mediterranean region.
Asplenium ruta-muraria|This perennial, evergreen fern occurs naturally on limestone and other basic rocks, where it grows on steep, bare faces and in crevices; it is also found in hollowed clints in limestone pavement. However, in most lowland areas it is now abundant on mortared walls and other man-made structures. 0-625 m (Ingleborough, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|Some decline in industrial areas through acidification has undoubtedly occurred (Page, 1997), but in recent years cleaner air may have reversed the decline. Other than this, most losses have occurred since 1950.|Circumpolar Temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Asplenium septentrionale|An often long-lived, evergreen fern of well-drained, exposed, sunny, usually acidic rock faces, metalliferous mine spoil and the sides of unmortared stone walls. In Ireland, it grows on ultrabasic rocks. 0-535 m (Moel yr Ogof, Caerns.), formerly to 715 m at Llyn y Cwn (Caerns.).|Native|Losses since 1930 have occurred through tidying and restoring old mining sites and walls, tree planting and scrub growth. It can rapidly colonise walls and mine spoil, but spread on natural rock is rare. New sites have been found in N.W. Scotland and C. Wales since 1987.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia and western N. America.
Asplenium trichomanes|A perennial, evergreen fern which grows in a range of rocky habitats, including cliffs, rock faces, screes, mine waste and, perhaps now most commonly, on walls. 0-870 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|There is evidence for some decline in East Anglia since 1950. This is a polyploid complex within which three ecologically and morphologically fairly distinct taxa have been recognised within the British Isles, all of which are mapped here separately. However, this taxonomic treatment over-simplifies a far more complex pattern of reticulate evolution.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.     © P. Shannon
Asplenium viride|A. viride is an evergreen fern of moist, sheltered crevices in basic rocks, and very rarely also on mortared walls. It is occasionally a colonist of old metal mine workings. From sea level on the coasts of W. Britain and Ireland to 975 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|This species shows no appreciable change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas. Because of its requirement for an environment which is cool and humid in summer (Page, 1997), its occasional occurrences in lowland C. and E. England have all been short-lived.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © Mahanova, Alla
Aster (alien N American taxa)|These perennial herbs are often naturalised on hedge banks, roadsides, railways, rubbish tips, waste ground and also river banks, lakesides, saltmarshes and in fens. Most colonies arise from discarded garden material, followed by rhizomatous spread or regeneration by seed. 0?345 m (Garrigill, Cumberland).|Neophyte|This map includes the species of Aster of N. American origin, and their hybrids. These have been grown in Britain since 1710 and are very difficult to separate. Plants are often recorded as Aster agg., and these and more precisely determined records are mapped here. A. schreberi was known from one site in Renfrewshire and A. laevis is a rare escape; the other three species and two hybrids are mapped separately. The maps must be regarded as provisional.|Natives of N. America.
Aster lanceolatus|A. lanceolatus has become established along railways and river banks, on roadsides and by car parks and on waste ground and tips. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. lanceolatus has been cultivated since 1811 and was recorded from the wild by 1865. According to Stace (1997) it is second only to A. x salignus in frequency in Britain, yet several county Floras record it as rare. This may indicate regional variation, but is more likely to reflect the difficulties experienced in separating A. lanceolatus from A. x salignus. Most occurrences have arisen from garden outcasts, but it may have been accidentally introduced by N. American servicemen in Wiltshire (Oliver, 1998).|Native of eastern N. America; widely naturalised in W. & C. Europe.
Aster lanceolatus x novi-belgii (A. x salignus)||||
Aster linosyris|"A perennial herb of shallow soil in open, grassy habitats on limestone sea-cliffs and rocky slopes, cliff-top grassland and wind-pruned heath overlying limestone. It is a poor competitor, and is usually intolerant of heavy grazing, although in Pembrokeshire it is found in low-growing, sheep-grazed, cliff-top grassland and heath. It seems to be self-incompatible and some small populations appear to represent single, self-sterile clones. Lowland.

Aster novae-angliae||||
Aster novi-belgii|A. novi-belgii is naturalised on hedge banks, railway banks, roadsides, rubbish tips and waste ground. In addition, it sometimes occurs on river banks, lakesides and in fen vegetation. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. novi-belgii was introduced as a garden plant in 1710. It was recorded in the wild by 1860 and the extant population at Wicken Fen (Cambs.) was found in 1864. Stace (1997) and other authors suggest that it has been much over-recorded in the past for A. x salignus and, no doubt, also for A. x versicolor.|Native of eastern N. America; widely naturalised in N.W. & C. Europe.
Aster tripolium|A short-lived perennial herb occurring at low elevations in ungrazed or lightly grazed saltmarshes, especially along creeksides, and also on muddy sea-banks, tidal river banks and in brackish ditches. In W. Britain and Ireland it also grows amongst rocks and on exposed sea-cliffs. It also occurs very locally in inland saltmarshes and recently it has been recorded beside salt-treated roads. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of A. tripolium has not appreciably changed since the 1962 Atlas. The rayless form, var. discoideus, was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968).|Eurasian Temperate element.
Astragalus alpinus|A perennial herb of species-rich, locally flushed calcareous grassland, and on base-rich ledges and rocky outcrops. Montane, from 650 m (Ben Vrackie, E. Perth) to 770 m (Creig an Dail Bheag, S. Aberdeen).|Native|A. alpinus is still extant in all four of its known localities, though populations on unstable rocks and crags are threatened by trampling and erosion, whilst colonies in grassland are suffering reduced flowering and seed set due to intensive grazing by sheep and deer.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Astragalus danicus|A perennial herb of short unimproved turf on well-drained calcareous soils, predominantly on chalk and limestone, but also on sand dunes and machair. In Scotland, it also grows on Old Red Sandstone sea-cliffs and on mica-schist. 0-710 m (Meall an Daimh, E. Perth).|Native|A. danicus showed only a modest loss, mainly in Gloucestershire and Yorkshire, before 1930. Since then it has declined substantially on the chalk in S. England and limestone in N.E. England, largely due to agricultural improvement or lack of grazing. It is stable elsewhere.|Circumpolar Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe and absent from eastern N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Astragalus glycyphyllos|A straggling perennial herb of cliffs, wood-borders, chalk pits and scrubby grassland on railway banks and road verges; mainly on calcareous soils and thriving on warm, sheltered banks and hollows without too much grazing. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m at Winskill Stones (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|This species is now much better recorded than it was for the 1962 Atlas, but county floras indicate a steady decline in sites because of the loss of rough grasslands and the tidying up of roadside banks and verges. It is often abundant where it occurs, but populations are becoming increasingly isolated.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.
Athyrium distentifolium|A deciduous fern of the higher mountains, growing on rock ledges, gullies, block screes and in shallow hollows where snow lies late into summer. It prefers more stable, acidic block screes with a N. or N.E. aspect and some degree of soil accumulation. Found from 455 m in the Breadalbanes (Mid Perth) to 1220 m (Ben Macdui, S. Aberdeen).|Native|There is little evidence for a change in the distribution of this species, although it is susceptible to over-grazing. It is probably under-recorded.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.
Athyrium filix-femina|A deciduous fern that prefers moist but well-drained acidic soils, but can tolerate more basic substrates if these are overlain by mildly acidic layers. It is particularly frequent in deciduous woodland, especially on stream banks, and in moist, rocky habitats, but is also found in hedgerows and drainage ditches. It is one of few species able to colonise metalliferous lead and tin mine deposits. 0-1005 m (Carnedd Llewelyn, Caerns.).|Native|There is little evidence for any change in the distribution of this species.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © G.

Athyrium flexile|A small deciduous fern usually found on cool, shaded, N.E.- to N.W.-facing scree-slopes or amongst block scree of acidic rocks, especially where snow lies late and where melt-water trickles down gullies. From 700 m on Meall Buidhe (Main Argyll) to 900 m (Glen Einich, Easterness), and reportedly to 1140 m.|Native|There is little evidence for any change in the distribution of this species, although it is not only taxonomically critical but difficult to find. Since it was first described in 1853 there has been doubt over its taxonomic status. Recent experimental work has shown that it is probably best regarded as a variety of A. distentifolium.|Endemic.
Atriplex glabriuscula|A procumbent annual found close to the strand-line on moderately exposed sand and shingle beaches, and in waste places near the sea. Lowland.|Native|It is difficult to interpret trends in the distribution of this species. A. glabriuscula is difficult to identify and is more comprehensively recorded in some areas than others. Some old records are probably unreliable due to confusion with other coastal Atriplex taxa, especially A. x taschereaui (A. glabriuscula x A. longipes) and A. prostrata.|Suboceanic Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.
Atriplex laciniata|A decumbent, widely spreading annual of sand and shingle beaches, more rarely found on saltmarsh-sand dune transitions and saltmarsh drift-lines. Populations are usually small and often of sporadic appearance. A. laciniata typically occurs with Cakile maritima, Salsola kali and other Atriplex species in a mixed strandline community. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change since the 1962 Atlas, though many populations, particularly those close to popular coastal resorts in S. England, have dwindled or been lost altogether due to excessive recreational pressure.|Oceanic Temperate element; also in N. America.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Atriplex littoralis|An erect annual of open, usually sandy or silty places near the sea, often forming dense stands along saltmarsh drift-lines, estuarine banks and sea-walls, and on waste ground around docks. It also grows in saline areas inland, and as a colonist by salt-treated roads. Lowland.|Native|The coastal distribution of A. littoralis has remained largely unchanged since the 1962 Atlas, but from the early 1980s onwards it spread rapidly along inland roadsides, particularly in E. England.|Circumpolar Temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Atriplex longipes|An erect to procumbent annual occurring in the upper parts of silty estuarine saltmarshes, usually in tall, ungrazed vegetation (including stands of Juncus maritimus and Phragmites australis) inundated by brackish water during high spring tides. Lowland.|Native|A. longipes was only confirmed as a British species in 1977, although it was first reported in 1957. It is almost certainly still under-recorded.|European Boreal-montane element.
Atriplex patula|An annual of cultivated ground, manure heaps, roadsides, rubbish tips and waste places in towns and cities; also on fertile soils in a wide range of disturbed semi-natural habitats, such as river banks, pond margins and sea-bird cliffs. A. patula is frequent in coastal waste places but rare in littoral zone habitats such as saltmarshes and sand and shingle drift-lines. Mainly lowland, but reaching 435 m in Clun Forest (Salop).|Native|There is little evidence of any change since the 1962 Atlas, where A. patula was mapped as `all records`.|Eurosiberian Wide-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Atriplex pedunculata|An annual occurring in the drier parts of saltmarshes; elsewhere in N. Europe (and formerly in Britain) in tidally inundated dune-slacks and saltmarsh-shingle transitions, and rarely as a casual in other open, disturbed saline areas near the sea. Lowland.|Native|A. pedunculata had been presumed extinct in the British Isles since the late 1930s until it was discovered near Shoeburyness, S. Essex, in 1987 (Leach, 1988). It is threatened there by encroaching stands of Elytrigia atherica, but further colonies and sites have been established using pot-grown plants and seeds derived from the original colony.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; at inland saline sites from C. Europe eastwards.
Atriplex portulacoides|A low shrub of muddy or sandy saltmarshes, commonly fringing intertidal pools and creeks, and often forming extensive stands on ungrazed saltings. In W. Britain and Ireland it also occurs locally on coastal rocks and cliffs. Lowland.|Native|This species markedly extended its range northwards in the British Isles during the 20th century, as shown by its spread in N. Ireland (Leach, 1989) and its recent resurgence on the Isle of Man (Allen, 1984). This has been paralleled by similar changes elsewhere in N. Europe, for example, in Sweden (Blomgren, 1992).|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © P. Shannon
Atriplex praecox|A small annual occurring on sand and shingle beaches around the margins of sea-lochs and other sheltered inlets and bays. It grows in the lowest part of sparsely vegetated strandlines below, for example, the zone normally occupied by Cakile maritima and other Atriplex species. Lowland.|Native|A. praecox was only recognised as a British species in 1975, and is almost certainly under-recorded. In Scandinavia this taxon is usually treated as A. longipes subsp. praecox.|European Boreal-montane element; also in Greenland.
Atriplex prostrata|An annual of beaches, saltmarshes and other open, often wet, saline habitats near the sea; also inland in disturbed areas on moist, fertile, neutral soils, such as the trampled margins of ditches and ponds, on cultivated land, tips and waste ground. It also grows in inland saltmarshes and along salt-treated roadsides. Generally lowland, but reaching 415 m at Carter Bar (Roxburghs.).|Native|Since the 1962 Atlas, A. prostrata has been better recorded on the coasts of N. and W. Britain and Ireland, but its increased frequency inland may partly represent its spread along roads.|Eurosiberian Wide-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Atropa belladonna|A robust rhizomatous perennial herb of dry disturbed ground, field margins, hedgerows and open woodland. It is native only on calcareous soils, particularly those overlying chalk, but it occurs on a wider range of soils as an alien, where it is often a relic of cultivation as a medicinal herb. Reproduction is mainly by bird-distributed seed. Lowland.|Native|Although highly persistent, A. belladonna has declined due to agricultural improvement and, in some cases, specific eradication. Some populations may well be ancient introductions and it is difficult to determine the status of many populations, even within its core area.|European Temperate element.
Avena fatua|An annual grass which is a common weed on arable land, especially in cereals, seeding before the cultivated crops. It is also found on roadsides and waste ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 300 m at Ffair-Rhos (Cards.).|Archaeophyte|A. fatua has expanded northwards and westwards in Britain since the 1962 Atlas. Within its former range it has dramatically increased in frequency since 1945, and has proved resistant to some herbicides, although specific controls are now available. However, weeding by hand (`rogueing`) is still a common practice.|Perhaps native to the E. Mediterranean region and the Near East, but has spread with cultivation and now has a virtually worldwide distribution outside the tropics.
Avena sativa|This annual grass is a frequent relic of arable crops, and an occasional casual on field edges, roadsides, tips and waste ground. It does not persist and is never naturalised. Lowland.|Casual|A. sativa was not cultivated until relatively recently compared to other cereals, perhaps evolving in Europe in the 2nd millennium bc and not reaching Britain until the Iron Age. It is now much less frequently grown as a crop than it was before the advent of mechanical transport, when there was more demand for horse food. However, botanists have only recently begun to record it as a casual; the first record in the wild was published in 1908.|A. sativa probably originated in cultivation, by selection from A. fatua.
Avena sterilis|An annual weed of winter cereal crops, predominately found on heavier clay soils. It also occurs as a wool or grain alien on waste ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|A. sterilis, which was cultivated in Britain by 1640, was first recorded in the wild in 1910 (Port Meadow, Oxon) and has apparently spread from Oxfordshire to neighbouring counties. It is now less frequent than twenty years ago. Almost all of the records of A. sterilis are for subsp. ludoviciana; subsp. sterilis is a rare casual, occasionally cultivated for ornament.|Native of the Mediterranean region, S.W. & C. Asia; widely naturalised north of its native range in Europe.
Avena strigosa|An annual grass once extensively cultivated, and also occurring as a field weed in N. & W. Britain, and in Ireland. It is an infrequent casual elsewhere. Lowland.|Casual|A. strigosa was for many centuries the main cereal cultivated in those areas of the north and west where conditions were unfavourable for A. sativa; it was first recorded in the wild in Britain in 1790. Since 1945 cultivation of A. strigosa has almost entirely ceased, new strains of A. sativa having replaced it. This is reflected in the declining frequency of the species as a casual.|Origin uncertain, but probably arose in cultivation; found as a crop or weed in N., W. & C. Europe.
Azolla filiculoides|A floating fern of canals, ditches, ponds and sheltered bays in lakes and rivers. It is most frequent in calcareous water, or near the sea. It reproduces vegetatively, often producing dense mats, and sporocarps are not uncommon. Generally lowland, but reaching 450 m above Rydal Water (Westmorland).|Neophyte|First recorded in Britain in 1883, this species is much more frequent now than it was in the 1962 Atlas. In some areas populations fluctuate greatly annually. It is widely cultivated and frequently disposed of into the wild.|Native of western N. & S. America; widely naturalised in temperate and southern Europe and elsewhere.     © L. Rooney
Baldellia ranunculoides|This perennial herb is restricted to habitats at the water`s edge, where potential competitors are restricted by fluctuating water levels, disturbance or moderate exposure. It usually grows in mildly to strongly calcareous or brackish waters, over a range of organic or inorganic substrates. 0-320 m (W. of Libanus, Brecs.).|Native|The decline of B. ranunculoides was already apparent in the 1962 Atlas, and can be attributed to the destruction of small waters and the colonisation of others by more competitive species once grazing ceases. Since then it has declined further in England but seems stable in the west of its range.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © C. Eccleston, IWNHAS
Ballota nigra|A foetid perennial herb of hedgerows, field-borders, walls, waysides and waste ground, often on disturbed nutrient-rich soils near habitations. Lowland, though it has been recorded as a casual at 480 m on Helvellyn (Cumberland).|Archaeophyte|Archaeological evidence suggests that B. nigra has been associated with human settlements since the Iron Age. It shows some small declines in the north and west, but many of these populations may only have been casual.|As an archaeophyte B. nigra has a European Southern-temperate distribution.     © S. Hammonds
Barbarea intermedia|A biennial herb, rarely a perennial or an annual, found in a variety of waste and disturbed places, although it was formerly most frequent as an arable weed. Generally lowland, but occurring as a casual at 340 m N. of Alston (Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species was first recorded in the wild before 1849, although it may have previously been confused with B. vulgaris. It has considerably increased since the 1962 Atlas, and may be seriously under-recorded in the Irish Republic.|Native of N.W. Africa and W. Europe from Spain to Denmark; naturalised north and east of its native range.
Barbarea stricta|A biennial or perennial herb of moist places by rivers, ditches, canals and marshes, and a rare casual of waste places. Lowland.|Neophyte|B. stricta was first recorded in Britain in 1843, although it may have previously been confused with B. vulgaris, and it is stable in its distribution.|A Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate species, absent as a native from much of W. Europe.
Barbarea verna|A biennial, or occasionally annual, herb which is most frequent as a garden escape on waste ground, by roads and on railways. It has a long-lived seed bank. Lowland.|Neophyte|B. verna was grown for centuries as a substitute for watercress, and is now widely cultivated again after a gap in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was first recorded in the wild in 1803. Although the overall range has not changed since the 1962 Atlas, there are many more recent records.|Native of S.W. Europe, east to Italy.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Barbarea vulgaris|A biennial or perennial herb preferring a damp substrate, and thus widespread by rivers and streams, avoiding only the most acidic sites. It is also found on roadsides, by hedges and in ditches and waste places. It requires a degree of disturbance, which may be provided by seasonal flooding or human activity. Generally lowland, but occurring as a casual at 380 m near Alston (Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of this species shows no appreciable change since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Bartsia alpina|A shortly rhizomatous perennial of base-rich soils. In England it is a plant of the drier hummocks in basic flushes and runnels in damp upland pastures, and of steep, flushed, species-rich banks. In the Breadalbanes (Mid Perth) it grows on the periodically inundated ledges of mica-schist crags. Seed-set is poor. From 245 m at Orton (Westmorland) to 950 m on Beinn Heasgarnich (Mid Perth).|Native|B. alpina sites have been lost from pastures through overgrazing, trampling by cattle and drainage, but ledge communities are largely unaffected. The overall distribution is unchanged from that shown in the 1962 Atlas.|European Arctic-montane element; also in N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Bellis perennis|A rosette-forming, winter-green, shortly stoloniferous perennial which grows in mown or heavily grazed or trampled grassland. It occurs in practically all types of neutral and calcareous grassland but it does best in those that are relatively wet for at least part of the year. It is most familiar as a weed of lawns and recreational areas, roadside verges and pastures, but more natural habitats include stream banks, lake margins, dune-slacks and the margins of upland flushes. 0-915 m (Caenlochan, Angus).|Native|The range of B. perennis is stable.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Berberis vulgaris|A deciduous shrub found in hedgerows and coppices, and on banks, cliffs and waste ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 395 m on Wanthwaite Crags (Cumberland).|Native|B. vulgaris has been recorded from Neolithic deposits at Grimes Graves (W. Norfolk). It might be native in England and Wales, but it was cultivated in medieval times and later widely planted for hedging. All records are mapped as if they are native. Its deleterious effect on wheat crops was appreciated before it was known to be a host of the rust Puccinia graminis and consequently eradicated from many hedgerows in the 19th century.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Berula erecta|This stoloniferous perennial occurs as a submerged aquatic in rivers and streams, and as an emergent species at the edges of lakes, ponds, rivers, ditches and canals, and in marshes. It is also found on seasonally-flooded wet ground, and usually roots into fine silt or mud. Vegetative spread is by short-lived stolons or rhizomes, but little is known of the frequency of reproduction by seed. Lowland.|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Declines have occurred, and analysis of the database reveals that most of these losses have occurred since 1950. They are probably caused by drainage and habitat destruction.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia and N. America.     © P. Shannon
Beta vulgaris||||
Betula nana|A low-growing, deciduous shrub of upland heaths and blanket bogs, usually found on acidic peat but occasionally rooted into rock crevices. It is found on both moderately dry, sloping sites and on waterlogged, flat ground. Germination may be frequent, but seedlings appear to be removed by grazing. Generally upland, reaching 860 m in Glen Cannich (E. Ross), but descending to 120 m in W. Sutherland.|Native|Although recording since the 1962 Atlas has extended its known range, and new populations continue to be found, B. nana is declining as a result of overgrazing, afforestation and burning.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Betula pendula|A deciduous tree found as even-aged stands or in mixed woodland on a wide range of light, well-drained, particularly acidic soils. It can rapidly colonise open ground, particularly burned areas, and can become a threat to open heathland. It is also widely planted on roadsides and in parkland. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Native|The distribution of B. pendula is apparently stable. Worrell & Malcolm (1998) have suggested that it is over-recorded in much of Scotland, as few recorders can reliably distinguish it from B. pubescens. Some introduced populations may also be mapped as native.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.
Betula pubescens|A deciduous tree, usually found in mixed woodland or as isolated trees on roadsides and field boundaries. It grows on a wide range of soils but prefers more acidic, wetter, peatier soils, especially in the uplands. It can rapidly colonise open, unshaded ground, particularly burned areas, open heathland and cut-out peat bogs. It is also widely planted, becoming established in urban areas. 0-685 m (Hilton Fell, Cumberland), and certainly higher in Scotland.|Native|The apparent increase since the 1962 Atlas is probably due to more comprehensive recording rather than a genuine spread, and the distribution is unchanged.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Bidens cernua|An annual, growing on a wide range of damp or wet substrates on the margins of slow-flowing rivers and streams, by ponds and meres, often in places subject to winter flooding; also in ditches and marshes. 0-310 m (Heathcote, Derbys.).|Native|B. cernua declined markedly in some areas before 1930. This decline, associated with drainage and habitat destruction, has continued, especially in S.E. England. It is now better recorded, particularly in Wales, Scotland and Ireland.|Circumpolar Temperate element.     © F.C. Eccleston
Bidens tripartita|An annual of nutrient-rich mud or gravel by ponds, occurring in wet pits, by slow rivers and streams, often in areas wet in winter but exposed in summer; also found in ditches, peat workings and other damp places. It prefers less acidic and drier substrates than B. cernua. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m at Pilleth (Rads.).|Native|This species is decreasing, particularly in S.E. England. Drainage, the infilling of ponds and ditches, and the canalisation of watercourses have all contributed to its decline. However, it is now much better recorded, especially in N. Ireland.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Blackstonia perfoliata|An annual or biennial herb of open dry (but frequently winter-wet), often stony, shallow basic soils. Its main habitats are calcareous grasslands and fixed sand dunes, but it can be an abundant colonist of disturbed ground, including quarries and railway cuttings, and on road verges and pathsides. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the overall distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, although it has spread into Northumberland since then (Swan, 1993).|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © P. Shannon
Blechnum spicant|This evergreen calcifuge fern grows on damp peaty or loamy soils in deciduous and coniferous woodland. In suitably wet climates it extends onto open moorland, streamsides and hedgerows. 0-1065 m (Aonach Beag, Westerness), and reportedly to 1185 m elsewhere in Scotland.|Native|Mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, this species has declined in England and C. Ireland; analysis of the database reveals that most losses have occurred since 1950. Declines are due to woodland clearance and the conversion of lowland heathland to improved pasture.|European Temperate element; also in E. Asia and western N. America.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Blysmus compressus|A rhizomatous perennial of open areas in marshes and fens, and in short, sedge-rich, damp grassland, calcareous flushes and stream borders which are subject to flooding. 0-490 m (Co. Durham).|Native|B. compressus has suffered a severe decline throughout its range. In the 1962 Atlas, more than half the squares from which it was recorded had been lost by 1930. This decline has continued, with 40% of its post-1930 squares now gone. Much of the decline has been due to drainage, the loss of unimproved damp grasslands, falling water-tables, eutrophication and the cessation of grazing.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; also in C. Asia.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Blysmus rufus|A rhizomatous perennial herb, found in sandy or gravelly wet runnels and depressions in saltmarshes, and in brackish ditches and dune-slacks. It also occurs on rocky shores, in freshwater seepages and beside streams where they debouch onto the beach. Lowland.|Native|Most of the losses of B. rufus around the Irish Sea and along the E. coast of Scotland took place before 1930, and the distribution now appears to be generally stable. It may still be present in some of the more remote 10-km squares in which it has not been seen since 1970.|European Boreal-montane element; also in C. Asia and N. America.
Bolboschoenus maritimus|A rhizomatous perennial mainly of saline ground or in shallow brackish water, usually rooted in mud but sometimes in gravel and shingle. Coastal habitats include saltmarshes, tidal river banks, creeks, ditches, lakes, ponds, borrow-pits, and also marshes and damp pastures. It is occasionally found in freshwater habitats inland, including flooded riversides and clay- and gravel-pits. B. maritimus reproduces by rhizomatous spread, tubers and seed. Lowland.|Native|The overall distribution of B. maritimus is stable. It is sometimes deliberately planted in lakes and ponds.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Botrychium lunaria|A small fern, often occurring singly or in small populations. It prefers well-drained sites, usually with a high base-content, although it can occur on more acidic substrates. Habitats include meadows, pastures, open woodland, sand dunes and grassy rock ledges. It can also colonise slag heaps and quarry spoil. 0-1065 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|B. lunaria was lost from many lowland sites before 1930, and this loss has continued, particularly in N. England, due to grassland improvement and scrub invasion. There appear to have been some losses in upland areas, but the species can easily be overlooked and may therefore be under-recorded.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Brachypodium pinnatum||||
Brachypodium sylvaticum|A tufted perennial herb of well-drained neutral to calcareous soils. In the lowlands, it is predominantly a plant of woodland and other shady habitats, including hedgerows, railway banks and roadsides, and it has colonised chalk and limestone downland following scrub invasion. It can persist in areas of former woodland or scrub. Above c. 200 m, it can occur in more open situations including limestone grassland and pavements, cliffs and screes. 0-465 m (Highfolds Scar, Malham, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|The distribution of B. sylvaticum is stable.|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © S. Hammonds
Brassica napus|An annual or biennial, rarely perennial, herb of disturbed ground on roadsides, waste and cultivated ground, rubbish tips and docks. Lowland, but casual at 420 m at Stainmore (Westmorland).|Neophyte|B. napus was first recorded in the wild in 1660. Two subspecies are widely cultivated in our area. The acreage of subsp. oleifera (Oil-seed Rape) has dramatically increased since 1980 and it is now widespread as a casual. Subsp. rapifera (Swede) is a rare relic of cultivation. The maps in the 1962 Atlas are unreliable, since this species was confused with B. rapa.|This allotetraploid, derived from B. oleracea and B. rapa, is not known in the wild but is naturalised in temperate regions throughout the world.     © P. Shannon
Brassica nigra|An annual forming persistent populations by rivers, where it is a member of the tall-herb community in the flood zone, and on sea-cliffs and shingle. It is also widespread as a casual on roadsides and waste ground, and can occur at the edge of arable fields. Generally lowland, but with a casual record at 380 m from Withypool (S. Somerset).|Native|B. nigra was first recorded in Britain in 1640. Its native range is uncertain and all records are therefore mapped as if they are native. The losses have largely occurred since the 1962 Atlas because it is now rarely grown for seed.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Brassica oleracea|A perennial herb, found as an apparent native on sea-cliffs, predominantly on chalk and limestone but also on other base-rich substrates. It is most frequent on bare cliff edges, but also grows in maritime grassland and in quarries inland. Elsewhere it is a casual garden escape in waste places and on roadsides. Lowland.|Native|B. oleracea was first recorded in Britain in 1548. On sea-cliffs it is impossible to distinguish native from alien populations and all are mapped as if they are native. These coastal plants are var. oleracea; other varieties and cultivars occur as casuals.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Brassica rapa|An annual or biennial herb, found as long-established populations on river and canal banks, and as a casual on roadsides, in arable fields and on tips. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Subsp. campestris is the taxon found in semi-natural habitats. Two other subspecies are widely cultivated in Britain: subsp. oleifera is a bird-seed or oil-seed species; subsp. rapa (Turnip) is a frequent relic of cultivation. The maps in the 1962 Atlas are unreliable, since this species was confused with B. napus.|A native of Eurasia; its precise native range is completely obscured by its spread in cultivation. It is also naturalised in Africa, N. & S. America and Australasia.
Briza maxima|An annual, naturalised or occurring casually on dry, bare banks and field margins, in cultivated ground including gardens, bulb-fields, on sand dunes, sea-cliffs, rubbish tips, waste ground and wall-tops, and in pavement cracks. Lowland.|Neophyte|B. maxima was introduced into Britain by 1633 and recorded in the wild by 1860 (Jersey). It appears to be increasing, especially in S.W. England and the Channel Islands. It is frequently grown for ornamental purposes, and is increasing as a garden escape. It is also introduced with wool shoddy and esparto.|Native of the Mediterranean region; widely naturalised in warm-temperate regions throughout the world.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Briza media|A shortly rhizomatous perennial grass, most frequently found in unimproved, species-rich, well-grazed grassland on infertile, calcareous soils and favouring well-drained slopes. However, it also occurs in old meadows and pastures on neutral and sometimes acidic soils, in the drier parts of fens, and occasionally in soligenous mires. 0-720 m (Knock Fell, Westmorland).|Native|There has been little change in the range of B. media since the 1962 Atlas. However, the map suggests some decline at the 10-km scale and local floras suggest that the ploughing and improvement of grasslands has led to a decline in frequency in many areas.|European Temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Briza minor|An annual mainly found on light, base-poor soils in arable habitats, including bulb-fields. It is also found, as a casual, by roadsides, on walls and, rarely, on waste land or rubbish tips. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|B. minor was first recorded from the wild in Britain in 1696 (Jersey). It is susceptible to herbicides and is unable to survive in highly fertilised crops, but persists in favourable, open habitats under non-intensive farming regimes.|A Mediterranean-Atlantic species. It was introduced with cultivation in the northern part of this range and is widely naturalised in warm-temperate regions throughout the world.
Bromopsis benekenii|A tufted perennial herb of lightly shaded places in woodland, especially beech woods; also found in scrub and hedgerows. It grows mainly in humus-rich but shallow calcareous soils, often on a slight slope. Lowland.|Native|B. benekenii is now much better recorded than it was for the 1962 Atlas, although it is almost certainly still under-recorded. It may be a subspecies of the very similar B. ramosa, with which it often grows.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; also in C. Asia.
Bromopsis erecta|A tufted winter-green perennial herb of dry, relatively infertile calcareous soils, growing in ungrazed or undergrazed chalk and limestone grasslands, where it often forms dense stands with Brachypodium pinnatum. It also occurs on calcareous sand dunes, roadside banks, quarry spoil and occasionally waste ground, but avoids wet or arable sites. It spreads by seed. Lowland.|Native|B. erecta has increased in grasslands where grazing pressures have relaxed, especially after the reduction of the rabbit population through myxomatosis in the 1950s.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Bromopsis inermis|A rhizomatous perennial herb of rough grassy places, road verges and field margins, which is resistant to drought and persists on sandy, well-drained soils. Elsewhere it occurs as a casual. Lowland.|Neophyte|B. inermis, which was first cultivated in Britain in 1794, was formerly sown as a fodder grass, but it is now introduced only as a seed contaminant. It has been known in the wild since 1890, and is spreading quickly in some areas on verges and waste ground.|B. inermis subsp. inermis is a Eurosiberian Temperate species; subsp. pumpelliana is native to N. America.
Bromopsis ramosa|A tufted perennial herb of shaded habitats on moist, moderately base-rich soils, including woodlands and hedgerows; it occasionally persists on sites of former woodland. Some bare soil is necessary for successful establishment from seed. Almost entirely lowland, but reaching 420 m at Garrigill (Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of B. ramosa is unchanged since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Bromus commutatus|An annual of unimproved damp meadows, also found on waysides, road verges and the borders of fields and tracks. Many recent records are of casual occurrences arising from grass-seed impurities. Lowland.|Native|B. commutatus is much better recorded than it was for the 1962 Atlas, and it is now possible to see a coherent distribution. It has declined since 1960 because of agricultural improvements to its meadow habitats. It is very closely allied to B. racemosus and easily confused with it; indeed, Stace (1997) suggests it might be better treated as a subspecies of that species.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Bromus hordeaceus|A winter-annual of moderately fertile neutral soils, particularly favouring disturbed or open habitats. It occurs on coastal cliffs, in pastures and hay meadows; also introduced as an impurity in grass-seed to arable fields, tracksides and waste ground. It does not form a persistent seed bank, and is intolerant of heavy grazing or frequent mowing. It tends to avoid wet or very acidic sites. 0?550 m (Kilhope, Co. Durham).|Native|The distribution of this variable species is unchanged. Subsp. hordeaceus occurs throughout the range of the species, subsp. divaricatus is a rare casual, and the other two subspecies are mapped separately.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Bromus racemosus|An annual of unimproved hay- and water-meadows, usually on damp, periodically flooded alluvial soils. It is most frequent on the drier margins of fields, sometimes growing on the dredgings from the ditches bordering them. It is also found as a grass-seed casual in arable margins and on verges. Generally lowland, with an old record of 365 m in the Scottish Highlands.|Native|B. racemosus is now much better recorded than it was in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined everywhere since 1930 through draining and improvement of its habitats, though it may occasionally have been mistaken for the closely related and perhaps conspecific B. commutatus.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Bromus secalinus|An annual or biennial of cereal fields, which is also found as a casual on waste ground, and occasionally in improved leys. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|B. secalinus has probably been present in Britain since prehistoric times, initially as an arable weed or perhaps as an alternative source of grain when the main crop failed. It was frequent in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but has since undergone a dramatic decline. However, it appears to be making a comeback in a few areas, such as Norfolk and Worcestershire. B. secalinus is sometimes confused with B. pseudosecalinus.|B. secalinus evolved in cultivation or spread in prehistory as a weed, perhaps a mimic of rye, from an unknown native range.
Bryonia dioica|A dioecious scrambling perennial herb with a massive, tuberous root-stock. It grows on well-drained, often base-rich, soils in hedgerows, scrub, woodland borders, and on rough and waste ground. It is unpalatable to rabbits and can be locally frequent around warrens. Lowland.|Native|There has been no substantial change in the distribution since the 1962 Atlas. The limits of its native distribution are remarkably stable.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © P. Shannon
Buddleja davidii|A large deciduous shrub, now very well established on waste ground, by railways, in quarries, on roadsides and generally in urban habitats, where it often grows on walls and neglected buildings. It prefers dry, disturbed sites where large populations can develop from its wind-dispersed seed. Lowland.|Neophyte|B. davidii was introduced into cultivation in the 1890s, and quickly became very popular in gardens. It was known to be naturalised in the wild in Merioneth by 1922 and Middlesex by 1927, and shown as locally well established in S. England in the 1962 Atlas. In recent decades it has spread rapidly throughout lowland Britain and, to a lesser extent, Ireland.|Native of China.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Bunium bulbocastanum|A tuberous perennial herb of dry chalk soils, most frequent in arable fields, especially where cultivation has ceased, and sometimes dominant in arable reverting to pasture. It also grows in rough or broken turf on chalk downs, field edges, in hedgerows and scrub, on roadside verges and in quarries. Reproduction is by seed. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the range of this species since the 1962 Atlas. It requires open soil for seedling establishment, but mature plants can thrive in closed swards and the tubers survive shallow-ploughing. Its absence from the North and South Downs is difficult to explain in view of its abundance in similar habitat at Boulogne (France).|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Bupleurum baldense|This diminutive annual is found in rabbit-grazed coastal grassland over calcareous substrates. Near Beachy Head (E. Sussex), it is found where the turf breaks to bare chalk near the eroding and overhanging cliff-edge, and in Devon on made-ground as well as in cliff-top turf. In the Channel Islands it grows in open turf on consolidated sand dunes and more rarely on cliffs. Lowland.|Native|B. baldense has been lost from some sites in Devon, but the populations at Beachy Head and those in the Channel Islands are stable.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Bupleurum falcatum|This biennial or short-lived perennial herb has been recorded in hedge banks and field-borders, on ditch banks and on roadside verges, but only recently in the latter habitat. Plants reproduce by seed, which appears to remain viable for only one year. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species, which was been cultivated in gardens by 1739, has only been naturalised in a single locality, at Norton Heath in S. Essex, where it was first recorded in 1831 and last seen in 1962. The present population there was established from seed taken from cultivated plants derived from the original colony. It is quite widely grown in gardens.|A Eurasian Southern-temperate species.
Bupleurum rotundifolium|This annual was formerly an arable weed of chalk and limestone soils, but it is now a rare bird-seed casual. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|B. rotundifolium was frequent in the mid 19th century but, with seed screening, became rare by the 20th century, and has been extinct in arable habitats since the 1960s. Germination of its seed is affected by late frosts, and its persistence depended on repeated re-introductions, often with clover seed, from S.W. Europe. It is often confused with B. subovatum, and some erroneous records may be mapped. Most of the East Anglian sites are deliberate introductions.|B. rotundifolium may originate in S.W. Asia; it is widespread as an archaeophyte in C. & S. Europe and has been introduced to many other areas worldwide.
Bupleurum tenuissimum|This slender, often diminutive, annual is primarily a colonist of thinly vegetated or disturbed coastal sites, including coastal banks, sea walls, drained estuarine marshes and the margins of brackish ditches. Inland populations formerly grew on commons and roadsides; it still grows on commons near Malvern (Worcs.). Lowland.|Native|Most of the inland sites for this species were lost before 1930, and the distribution seems to have been largely stable since the 1962 Atlas. It was recorded from the central reservation of the A2 near Dartford (W. Kent) in 1982 but has otherwise shown little tendency to colonise salted roadsides.|European Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Butomus umbellatus|A submerged or emergent rhizomatous perennial which grows in calcareous, often eutrophic, water at the edges of rivers, lakes, canals, ditches and in swamps. It rarely sets seed but reproduces by lateral buds on the rhizome. Lowland.|Native|B. umbellatus has maintained its core distribution since the 1962 Atlas. It has spread in the Tweed catchment, where it was first recorded in 1956, and along the River Eden (Cumbria). In Ireland Webb & Scannell (1983) suggest that it is native in some areas, including Co. Clare, but it is treated here as alien; it spread rapidly around Lough Neagh in the 20th century.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Buxus sempervirens|An evergreen shrub or small tree, native to woodlands and thickets on steep slopes on chalk, and in scrub on chalk downland. It is popular for hedging in gardens and is often planted in woodlands, often becoming naturalised. Lowland.|Native|Although B. sempervirens is thought to be native at some sites, including Box Hill (Surrey), Boxley (E. Kent) and possibly elsewhere, it has been widely cultivated since Roman times and the limits of its native range are uncertain. Its alien range has increased dramatically since the 1962 Atlas due to widespread planting and more efficient recording of alien trees and shrubs.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Cakile maritima|An annual, predominately found on sandy seashores and on fore-dunes. It is often very frequent along the winter storm tide-line where there is a good source of nutrients. It is rarer on shingle beaches and is only an occasional casual elsewhere. Seeds are dispersed by tides. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of C. maritima seems stable in Britain, though numbers fluctuate enormously from year to year.|European Wide-temperate element.     © S. Hammonds
Calamagrostis canescens|A perennial herb of lakeside marshes, fen-meadows, tall-herb fens and Alnus or Salix carr, often in extremely species-rich vegetation and sometimes forming extensive stands. Generally lowland, but reaching 335 m on Malham Moor (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|The retreat of C. canescens from its peripheral localities was apparent in the 1962 Atlas, and has continued in some areas. Even within its core range, succession and falling water tables may be reducing the extent of wetland habitats available for this species. On the other hand, all records in the Scottish Borders have been made since 1962.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Calamagrostis epigejos|A tufted rhizomatous perennial, occurring in damp woods, ditches, fens, ungrazed or lightly grazed grasslands, and on sheltered sea-cliffs and sand dunes; also as a colonist of artificial habitats such as old quarries, roadsides and railway banks. It usually grows on light sands or heavy clays. 0-370 m (Great Asby, Westmorland).|Native|There has been some change since the 1962 Atlas, with C. epigejos either having been better recorded, or increasing its range. Counties in which local floras recorded it rarely in the past now have more records and it has spread locally because of a relaxation of grazing.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.     © S. Hammonds
Calamagrostis purpurea|An apomictic rhizomatous perennial herb of wet Salix carr, especially in areas that are flooded in winter. It also occurs in marshes, ditches and old peat diggings. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Native|The presence of this taxon in Britain was not recognised until 1980, although it had been collected before that date (such as from near Braemar, S. Aberdeen, in 1941). It may be under-recorded.|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element.
Calamagrostis scotica|A tufted rhizomatous perennial herb, restricted to a single site, where it occurs in areas of Juncus dominated pasture, along drainage channels and in Salix carr and tall-herb fen. Lowland.|Native|This taxon was not mapped separately in the 1962 Atlas, being grouped with C. stricta as C. neglecta agg. Reports of C. scotica occurring elsewhere in N. Scotland and in Roxburghshire have never been substantiated and are probably errors for C. stricta.|Endemic.
Calamagrostis stricta|A tufted rhizomatous perennial herb of near-neutral mires and lake margins. 0-340 m (Kingside Loch, Selkirks.).|Native|It is hard to assess trends in the distribution of C. stricta as it has been confused in the past with C. scotica, C. purpurea and hybrids of C. canescens (including C. canescens x C. stricta). It has certainly been lost from some sites through drainage, but is easily overlooked and may still be present in several squares for which only pre-1987 records are available.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Calendula officinalis|An annual typically found in or near gardens, and on waste ground and rubbish tips. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was being grown in British gardens by 995 (Harvey, 1981) as a pot-herb, and as a medicinal and ornamental plant. It also occurs as a bird-seed and esparto alien. It readily escapes, being known from the wild by 1872 (Fife). It is increasing in the Isles of Scilly, where it was first recorded in 1939, the Channel Islands, and in sheltered places in S. Britain, but it seldom persists elsewhere.|A garden plant of unknown origin.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Callitriche brutia|An annual or perennial herb, growing in ephemeral pools, ruts and poached muddy ground, although it may also occur in permanent water. Generally lowland, but discovered in 2000 at 950 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|This appears to be the most abundant Callitriche in some areas, such as the New Forest (S. Hants.) and the Lizard (W. Cornwall), and is certainly more widespread than previously thought. However, it was not differentiated from C. hamulata in the 1962 Atlas, and no direct comparison is possible. Only forms with pedunculate fruit can be separated from C. hamulata without chromosome counts.|European Southern-temperate element.
Callitriche hamulata||||
Callitriche hamulata sens.lat.|These perennial herbs grow in both deep, still water and fast-flowing rivers, particularly in acidic, oligotrophic water. They may be annual in temporary water bodies, such as pools, ditches and reservoir edges. 0?915 m (Sgurr na Lapaich, Easterness).|Native|As in the 1962 Atlas, this map combines records for C. hamulata and C. brutia, but the broadly defined species is much better recorded now. So many records are referable to C. hamulata sens. lat. that a reliable map of C. hamulata sens. str. cannot be produced. There is also doubt over the taxonomic separation of these two species.|C. hamulata sens. lat. has a European Wide-temperate distribution; it also occurs in Greenland and as an alien in Australasia.
Callitriche hermaphroditica|This species occurs in mesotrophic lakes, canals and gravel-pits. It is usually annual, although some populations may perennate. 0-390 m at Drumore Loch (E. Perth).|Native|C. hermaphroditica was under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas. There is no evidence of a general decline, though it has been lost from some sites, possibly because of deteriorating water quality. However, recent records from gravel-pits in Lincolnshire and canals in the Midlands suggest that it may be spreading in those areas. It is morphologically variable; populations in our area include at least three forms.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Callitriche obtusangula|A perennial herb typical of permanent, still or slow-flowing mesotrophic to eutrophic waters, extending into brackish water in coastal grazing marshes. It also grows in a terrestrial form on wet mud as water levels drop. Lowland.|Native|C. obtusangula was under-recorded for the 1962 Atlas. There is no evidence of any genuine change in its distribution.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © S. Hammonds
Callitriche platycarpa|A perennial herb, occurring in most types of water body and as a terrestrial form on wet mud. However, it appears to be most frequent in eutrophic waters, particularly ditches and canals. Generally lowland, but reaching 520 m at Llynnoedd Ieuan (Cards.).|Native|Records for C. platycarpa were mapped with C. stagnalis in the 1962 Atlas, so no direct comparison is possible. It is still under-recorded, and it is possible that it is the most abundant species of Callitriche in lowland Britain. It may be spreading in Britain because of eutrophication, as appears to have happened in Sweden.|European Temperate element.

Callitriche stagnalis sens.lat.||||
Callitriche truncata|An annual or occasionally perennial herb, growing in rivers, canals, ditches, lakes and gravel-pits, typically in base-rich mesotrophic or eutrophic waters, and rarely as a terrestrial plant on wet mud. Lowland.|Native|C. truncata appears to be increasing and spreading northwards in Britain. It has been discovered since the 1962 Atlas in Essex, Lincolnshire and Anglesey, and its range now overlaps with that of C. hermaphroditica.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element. C. truncata is also spreading northwards in mainland Europe.     © S. Hammonds
Calluna vulgaris|A low shrub, often dominant on heaths, moors and nutrient-poor grasslands, and in open woodland on acidic soils, ranging from dry exposed habitats to wet peat bogs. It can colonise newly available habitats. 0-1040 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry), with a single bush at 1095 m on Beinn a`Bhuird (S. Aberdeen).|Native|Suitable habitat for C. vulgaris has declined greatly, particularly in much of England, since 1950 through loss of heathland to forestry, agriculture, mineral workings and scrub. It cannot tolerate continued heavy grazing, and has declined in some upland areas for this reason.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in C. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © S. Hammonds
Caltha palustris|A perennial herb of various wet habitats, usually neutral to base-rich rather than very acidic, including Alnus carr, the edges of rivers, streams, canals, lakes and ponds, ditches and winter-wet meadows and pastures. A small form, var. radicans, is found in mountain flushes and lake shores in N. & W. Britain and Ireland. 0-1100 m (Braeriach and Lochnagar, S. Aberdeen).|Native|There is little evidence of any change in the 10-km square distribution of this species.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element.     © S. Hammonds
Calystegia pulchra|A climbing perennial found naturalised in hedges and on waste ground, usually close to habitation. Reproduction is mainly vegetative and seed rarely ripens in our area. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. pulchra has been cultivated in Britain since 1823. The earliest specimens from our area were collected in 1867 (from London, though perhaps a garden plant) and 1884 (Edinburgh). It was not recognised in the wild until 1956, and described as a distinct species by Brummitt & Heywood (1960). It is much better recorded now than it was in the 1962 Atlas.|Origin unknown ? either originating in cultivation or a native of N.E. Asia; widely naturalised in N. & C. Europe.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Calystegia sepium|A perennial climber, occurring in hedges, scrub, woodland edges, tall-herb fens, in open Salix and Alnus carr, and on railway banks and waste ground. It also occurs in artificial habitats in built-up areas and near habitation. 0?365 m (near Buxton, Derbys.).|Native|There is no change in the range of this species since the 1962 Atlas. Two subspecies occur in our area: subsp sepium is found throughout the range of the species and subsp. roseata is mapped separately. A third, subsp. spectabilis, was formerly recorded as a garden relic in Merionethshire.|Circumpolar Temperate element.     © S. Hammonds
Calystegia silvatica|A climbing or scrambling perennial of hedges, fences, gardens and waste ground. It also spreads into semi-natural habitats away from habitation. Seed-set is often very poor. 0-350 m (Ravenstonedale, Westmorland).|Neophyte|C. silvatica has been cultivated in Britain since 1815. It was collected from the wild in 1863 but not recognised as distinct from C. sepium until 1948, by which time it was widespread. The distribution is now stable. Two subspecies occur in Britain; subsp. disjuncta is common, but subsp. silvatica may be more frequent in W. Britain and Ireland.|Native of the Mediterranean region and S.W. Asia.     © S. Hammonds
Calystegia soldanella|A trailing perennial herb found on sand dunes, and above the strand-line on sand and shingle beaches, often with Eryngium maritimum. Lowland.|Native|The disturbance and loss of its habitat has led to many losses of this species, particularly in S. and E. England, though it seems to be relatively resistant to trampling.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; also in western N. America and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Camelina sativa|An annual, now occurring mainly as a casual on rubbish tips and waste ground, and in gardens. It was formerly a frequent weed of arable fields and a contaminant of flax seed. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|C. sativa, cultivated in Europe since prehistoric times, was formerly a frequent casual. Most 19th century records were of escapes from cultivation for oil and fibre, and of grain aliens, but nearly all recent records arise from bird-seed mixtures.|Native range uncertain, but now widespread in Eurasia and introduced to N. America and elsewhere.
Campanula glomerata|A perennial herb of calcareous grassland, scrub, open woodland, cliffs and sand dunes. It is most frequent on chalk and oolite, and curiously absent from apparently suitable habitat on other limestones and base-rich substrates. It also occurs as a garden escape on roadsides and waste ground. 0-355 m (Oddendale, Westmorland).|Native|This species has seen a gradual decline outside its core areas, due to habitat loss and a decline in grazing. Many populations are small, often consisting of only a few plants (Green et al., 1997). C. glomerata is widely grown in gardens and several cultivars are available.|Eurasian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © L. Rooney
Campanula latifolia|A large perennial herb of damp woodland, wooded riversides and hedgerows, usually on fertile, neutral or calcareous soils. It is also grown in gardens, occurring as an established alien on waste ground, roadsides and hedge banks. Generally lowland, but reaching 390 m at Ingleborough (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|Within its native range, this species has shown little change in overall distribution since the 1962 Atlas. It is, however, becoming more frequent as an alien. It is regarded as an alien in Ireland (Scannell & Synnott, 1987).|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.     © S. Hammonds
Campanula patula|A biennial herb of dry, well-drained, sunny sites on fairly infertile sandy or gravelly soils. It is found in open woodland, on banks and rock outcrops. Reproduction is by seed, which needs disturbed sites for germination, but which is long-lived, allowing the plant to reappear after long absences. Lowland.|Native|The decline of C. patula was already apparent in the 1962 Atlas. It has since disappeared from many sites through the cessation of coppicing and other disturbance in woodland, and the increased use of herbicides on roadsides and railway banks.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Campanula persicifolia|A rhizomatous perennial herb found on waste ground, waysides and banks, and in hedgerows and woods. It is commonly cultivated, and occurs as a casual or, more frequently, as established and persistent populations. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. persicifolia, introduced into cultivation before 1596, was claimed as native when it was found in the wild by Druce (1903), but the evidence for this is very unconvincing. The large increase in records since the 1962 Atlas is probably due to continued escapes from cultivation, as well as to better recording of aliens.|A European Temperate species, absent as a native from much of W. Europe.
Campanula portenschlagiana||||
Campanula poscharskyana||||
Campanula rapunculoides|A rhizomatous perennial herb of roadside verges, grassy banks, railway banks and occasionally woodland and field-borders. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m at Felindre (Rads.).|Neophyte|This species was cultivated in Britain by 1568 and was first recorded from the wild around 1708. It is frequently grown in gardens where it can become invasive and is often discarded. Despite this, populations in the wild are often short-lived and this may help to explain the decline, which was already apparent in the 1962 Atlas.|A European Temperate species, apparently native north to the Netherlands, but naturalised to S. Fennoscandia.
Campanula rapunculus|A perennial herb found naturalised in rough grassland and on roadsides, railway banks and in quarries. It also occurs as a relic of cultivation. Reproduction is from seed and rhizome fragments. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|C. rapunculus was once frequently grown in gardens in our area for ornament and its edible roots. It was recorded from the wild as early as 1597, but fell out of favour as a vegetable around 1700 and has consequently declined seriously. It is now rarely encountered, either in cultivation or in the wild.|C. rapunculus is a variable species with a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is naturalised in Europe north of its native range.
Campanula rotundifolia|A rhizomatous perennial herb of dry, open, infertile habitats including grassland, fixed dunes, rock ledges, roadsides and railway banks. It tolerates a wide range of soil pH, being found on both mildly acidic and calcareous substrates, and heavy-metal tolerant races are known. 0-1160 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no significant change in the range of this species, other than some local declines at the edges of its range. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Its absence from some apparently suitable areas, especially in S.W. England, is very difficult to explain.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Campanula trachelium|A large perennial herb, found as a native on dry, base-rich, usually calcareous soils in woodland, scrubby grassland and hedge banks; in Ireland it is also reported from river banks and swamp woodland. It is also grown in gardens, and occurs as a naturalised alien on a wider range of soils and habitats. Generally lowland, but reaching 320 m in Monk`s Dale (Derbys.).|Native|This species has declined slightly through habitat loss arising from the cessation of coppicing and the removal of hedgerows. Alien records were not mapped in the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.
Capsella bursa-pastoris|An annual, germinating throughout the year in suitable conditions and ubiquitous in many disturbed and nutrient-rich habitats. It is abundant on waste ground and in gardens, and is frequent in cultivated fields, particularly amongst broad-leaved crops. It avoids the wettest and most acidic soils. It has a very long-lived seed bank. 0-780 m (Knock Fell, Westmorland).|Archaeophyte|The overall range of C. bursa-pastoris is stable, and the reason for the apparent losses in Scotland are unclear.|As an archaeophyte this species has a Eurosiberian Wide-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-temperate.     © P.

Cardamine amara|A perennial winter-green herb of streamsides and marshes, wet meadows and wet woodland, often growing in slow-moving or still water, preferring an acidic substrate and tolerant of shade. Generally lowland, but reaching 640 m in the Ochil Hills (W. Perth).|Native|The distribution of C. amara is stable in Britain, with some local losses in S.E. England which are presumably attributable to agricultural improvements. In Ireland the dramatic increase in records since the 1962 Atlas appears to result from both a genuine spread and better recording.|European Temperate element.
Cardamine bulbifera|A rhizomatous perennial herb which grows in Britain in two habitats: on dry woodland slopes over chalk in the Chilterns, and in damp woodlands over clay in the Weald. Elsewhere it is an escape from cultivation by roads and in woodland and parkland. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of C. bulbifera in its major strongholds is stable. It is not known whether the disjunct, apparently native populations reflect a wider earlier range, ancient long-distance dispersal or more recent colonisation. C. bulbifera sometimes escapes from cultivation, but these plants differ in leaf-shape.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Cardamine flexuosa|A winter- or summer-annual, or rarely a short-lived perennial, most frequent in open, moist, shaded vegetation in marshland, by rivers and streams, and in gardens. It prefers soils which are at least mildly basic, and is absent from those that are strongly acidic. It is an effective colonist of disturbed, fertile habitats. Generally lowland, but reaching 830 m on Snowdon (Caerns.) and 1190 m in the Breadalbanes (Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no change in the range of C. flexuosa since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; also in C. & E. Asia and N. America.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Cardamine hirsuta|A winter-annual which, under favourable conditions, can flower and seed again in autumn. C. hirsuta is particularly common as a weed of cultivation and in other ruderal habitats, but it also grows on rock outcrops, by streams and in woods. 0-1190 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of C. hirsuta is stable, other than in N. Scotland and W. Ireland where it is uncertain whether the concentration of pre-1970 records indicates a real decline or a lack of recording in spring.

Cardamine impatiens|A biennial herb found in woodland (particularly under Fraxinus), on moist limestone rocks (including the grikes of limestone pavement) and stable screes, by rivers and on damp roadsides; rarely found as a garden escape. It is intolerant of competition, but can be invasive in recently disturbed habitats. 0-610 m (Ingleborough, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|Populations fluctuate markedly from year to year and from site to site, but the overall distribution of this species is stable. In Ireland it is probably only native in Co. Westmeath.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Cardamine pratensis|A perennial herb of wet grassy places on moderately fertile, seasonally waterlogged soils in woods, wet meadows, fens and flushes. In upland areas it is also found in rush pasture and bryophyte-rich springs. It occasionally persists in gardens and lawns. It is morphologically and cytologically variable, many clones reproducing by rooting from the leaves. 0-1080 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no change in the overall distribution since the 1962 Atlas. Although many of its lowland habitats have been improved, C. pratensis is resistant to some herbicides and can survive in semi-improved pastures.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element.     © P. Shannon
Carduus crispus|A biennial herb of woodland margins, ditch-banks, damp hedge bottoms, streamsides, tall grassland, roadsides, railway banks and waste places, especially on clay soils with a high nutrient status. In Ireland, it is confined as a native to dry banks and waste places. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m above Castleton (Derbys.).|Native|The core distribution of C. crispus is stable. It may only have been present as a casual in squares at the periphery of its range from which it has not been recorded recently. In N. Scotland it is only present as an introduction in waste places.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.     © P. Shannon
Carduus nutans|This biennial, or sometimes perennial, herb is mainly found on chalk, limestone or lime-enriched soils, but also occurs on sandy or shingly ground. It is found in rough, often overgrazed or recently established pastures, on roadsides and in disturbed places. Generally lowland, but reaching c. 530 m at High Cup Nick (Westmorland).|Native|The overall distribution of C. nutans is similar to that in the 1962 Atlas, but it is now better recorded in many areas. It has always been rare in Ireland, where it is generally considered to have been introduced as a seed contaminant.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P.

Carex acuta|A rhizomatous perennial of shallow water or wet ground at the edges of rivers, streams, canals, lakes and ponds, in swamps, ditches and unimproved flood meadows and in marshland. It usually grows in calcareous and mesotrophic or eutrophic conditions, in areas subject to frequent flooding. It is shade-tolerant and sometimes grows under riverside trees or in wet woodland. Lowland, but formerly at 335 m at Greystoke (Cumberland).|Native|C. acuta, though now better recorded than for the 1962 Atlas, has declined in many areas, principally because of drainage and canalisation of rivers and streams.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.
Carex acutiformis|This rhizomatous perennial herb grows in base-rich, mesotrophic and eutrophic water, often occurring in extensive stands. Its habitats include river banks, lakes and pond margins, marshy areas near streams, fen-meadows and tall-herb fen, and carr; it is notably shade-tolerant. It avoids sites subject to marked fluctuations in water level. Reproduction by seed is poor. 0-370 m (near Garrigill, Cumberland).|Native|C. acutiformis was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Apart from some local declines, its distribution seems generally stable.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Carex appropinquata|A tussock-forming perennial herb, mainly occurring in open fenland but also in Salix-carr where, however, its numbers may sometimes be reduced by shading and drying out. Generally lowland, but reaches 380 m at Malham Tarn (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|C. appropinquata has declined in its East Anglian stronghold and in its Yorkshire lowland sites as a result of drainage and recent dry summers. However, the sites in the Scottish Borders, all discovered since the 1962 Atlas, appear to be in good heart, and the distribution in Ireland seems stable.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Carex aquatilis|A morphologically variable, rhizomatous perennial. In the lowlands, robust plants grow on river banks and the margins of lakes, mires and reed-swamps. In its upland sites, it is a shorter plant and often grows on deep, wet, gently sloping peat. 0-975 m (Glas Maol, Angus).|Native|Because of better recognition and recording, C. aquatilis is now known from very many more 10-km squares than it was in the 1962 Atlas, although it may remain overlooked in some areas.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.     © Pete Stroh
Carex arenaria|A rhizomatous perennial herb of sandy habitats, where it can be a dominant plant of fixed dunes, dune-slacks, sandy flats and on tracksides or other ruderal habitats. Though predominantly coastal, it can be locally common on dunes and heaths inland, particularly on the Lincolnshire coversands and in Breckland. It can be a rapid coloniser, spreading by far-creeping rhizomes. It is occasionally found as an alien on railway clinker. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the overall distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Carex atrata|A perennial herb found on ungrazed faces and ledges of wet or dry calcareous cliffs. It grows in short vegetation or amongst tall herbs, or in dwarf Salix scrub. Populations are probably maintained by vegetative growth. From 550 m in Coire Ghamhnain (Main Argyll) and usually above 700 m, reaching 1095 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of C. atrata is stable.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.     © Pete Stroh
Carex atrofusca|This perennial herb grows in stony, calcareous, usually micaceous flushes (especially at the point of emergence of springs) and bogs, and rarely on wet mountain ledges and crags. It often grows on or amongst grassy tussocks. Formerly recorded below 600 m, it is currently known from five localities between 680 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth) and 1000 m (Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas. A record from Beinn an Dothaidh (Main Argyll) in 1976 has not been confirmed and is now regarded as dubious.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Carex bigelowii|A perennial herb of well-drained montane grassland and sedge-heath, of open stony ground, in corries where snow lies late, and gullies subject to flushing. From 15 m at Tressa Ness (Shetland), but generally an upland species, reaching 1305 m on Ben Macdui (S. Aberdeen).|Native|Apart from a few pre-1930 losses, particularly in Ireland, the distribution of C. bigelowii is stable.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Carex binervis|A perennial herb of both wet and dry acidic soils found in a wide range of habitats from lowland heaths and Nardus grassland to heather moors, rocky hillsides and mountain summits. Its preferred sites are generally open but it also occurs in shady places, including deciduous and mixed woodlands. It is also occasionally found on coastal cliffs. 0-930 m (Glyder Fach, Caerns.) and reportedly to 975 m in the Scottish Highlands.|Native|This species is common in suitable habitats, and its distribution appears to be stable. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Carex buxbaumii|A perennial herb found in mesotrophic fens on or near the margins of lakes, often bordering outflow streams, and always in areas which are periodically inundated. It is often subject to light grazing by cattle. Lowland.|Native|C. buxbaumii is known from four sites in Scotland, two of which have been discovered since the 1962 Atlas. All colonies appear to be thriving. In Lough Neagh, it was last recorded on an island in 1886, shortly after the `almost impenetrable thicket of scrubby wood` in which it grew was cleared and the area grazed as pasture.|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; also in E. Asia and N. America.
Carex capillaris|A perennial herb of base-rich upland grasslands, particularly those flushed by calcareous springs, and moist limestone or mica-schist crags, slopes and ledges. Though it can tolerate some shading, it is generally found in open situations and short vegetation, often in species-rich communities. It is usually found at moderate or high altitudes, reaching 1035 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth), but it descends to sea level in N. Scotland.|Native|The overall distribution of C. capillaris is unchanged since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.     © Pete Stroh
Carex caryophyllea|A shortly rhizomatous perennial typically found in meadows and pastures on dry, calcareous or base-rich soils; also occurring in grasslands and heaths on mildly acidic soils, and in well-drained pastures, ledges and flushes in the uplands. 0-765 m (Knock Fell, Westmorland).|Native|C. caryophyllea was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined, especially in Devon, the English Midlands and S.E. England, and analysis of the database reveals that most of the losses have occurred since 1950.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Carex chordorrhiza|This rhizomatous perennial herb is found in fens and base-poor mires, where it usually grows in standing water. Propagation appears to be mainly vegetative by long trailing runners, although genetic variation within its populations suggests that it also reproduces by seed. Lowland.|Native|C. chordorrhiza may be a late glacial relic in our area. It was discovered in Westerness in 1978, and is now known to be much more frequent there than was first supposed. It is susceptible to both drainage and, apparently, to prolonged submergence.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Carex curta|A perennial herb of lowland bogs, floating Sphagnum rafts in lowland basin mires, nutrient-poor mires in the mountains, and wet, acidic, occasionally sandy heaths. 0-1100 m (Ben Alder, Westerness).|Native|The 1962 Atlas shows a decline in this species since 1930, especially in England. Since then, a few more sites in the lowlands have been lost to drainage, but many more have been discovered in the west, particularly in Wales and N. Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.     © Pete Stroh
Carex davalliana|This species has been recorded in Britain only in a calcareous mire at Lansdown near Bath (N. Somerset). Lowland.|Native|C. davalliana is extinct. It was discovered before 1809, but Babington (1834) noted that it `has not been found for some years`. The site was drained and subsequently built on, and there was no trace of the plant in 1852.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Carex depauperata|A perennial herb of dry, base-rich, free-draining soils. At its two extant sites in England it grows in semi-shade on laneside banks at the edge of deciduous woodland; in Ireland it grows in a partially shaded, wooded limestone area. It cannot tolerate deep shade. Lowland.|Native|Woodland removal or lack of woodland management probably account for the decline of this species in Britain. It responds well to coppicing and periodic disturbance. One English site has been augmented with re-introductions. The species has been recently added to the Scottish flora as a result of the discovery of old herbarium specimens (Rich et al., 2000).|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element; also in C. Asia.
Carex diandra|A perennial herb of wet, peaty areas, tolerating both acidic soils and those flushed by calcareous springs. It is often found on the margins of pools and in swamps, though it can also thrive on the edges of wet woods, among scattered trees or in fen-carr. Generally lowland, but reaching 370 m near Malham Tarn (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|C. diandra has been lost as a result of drainage and scrub encroachment from many lowland sites, especially in S. and E. England, during the 20th century. Most losses occurred before 1930, but are still continuing in England. It is now much better recorded in Scotland and N. Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Carex digitata|A perennial herb, mainly occurring in open deciduous woodland over limestone, but also found on adjacent scree, rock outcrops, and sheltered limestone pavement. It seeds freely in lightly shaded habitats but ceases to flower and dies out if the canopy becomes too closed or the site overgrown. New plants can appear from dormant seed following disturbance. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of C. digitata seems stable, and it is now much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas.|European Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; also in E. Asia.
Carex dioica|A shortly rhizomatous perennial herb of very wet, neutral to base-rich mires. It grows particularly well in silty, calcareous mud and by the edges of lime-rich flushes and springs. Although it occurs at sea level, many sites are at moderate or high altitudes, ascending to about 1000 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|C. dioica declined dramatically in lowland England before 1930, due to drainage and agricultural improvement. There have been further losses there (half the remaining sites south of the Severn-Humber line), but there are now a very substantial number of new records from N. and W. Britain, and from Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Carex distans|A perennial herb found on sea-cliffs, rocky shores, in coastal grasslands and the uppermost parts of saltmarshes; usually growing in bare rock-crevices or on free-draining sandy or gravelly substrates, but also in flushes and seepage zones on cliffs, and where streams debouch onto the shore. Inland, it occurs in wet meadows, marshes and fens on mineral-rich soils. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of C. distans since the 1962 Atlas, although it has declined inland due to the drainage and improvement of its wetland habitats.|European Southern-temperate element.
Carex disticha|This rhizomatous species is found in wet meadows and marshes, fens, by ditches and streams, on the margins of lakes and ponds, and occasionally in dune-slacks. It almost invariably grows in well-illuminated sites, particularly on base-enriched substrates, and favours areas with a fluctuating water table. Generally lowland, but reaching 455 m on Windburgh Hill (Roxburghs.).|Native|C. disticha has declined in many areas of England since the 1962 Atlas because of drainage, although it can be easily overlooked, especially when it is present only as scattered non-flowering shoots.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Carex divisa|A rhizomatous perennial herb of brackish ditches, dune-slacks and damp grasslands near the sea. It avoids areas of standing water. Lowland.|Native|C. divisa suffered losses, particularly in S.W. England, before 1930. It remains frequent in suitable areas in S. and E. England, and there has been little change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas despite local losses due to coastal development and the widespread conversion of grazing marshes to arable. In Ireland, the populations in Co. Dublin have been lost to building and it was considered to be extinct in Co. Kilkenny and Co. Wexford until re-discovered in 1990.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.
Carex divulsa||||
Carex echinata|A perennial of seasonally or permanently waterlogged habitats on acidic to base-rich substrates. It is found in a wide range of mires, wet heaths, upland flushes and springs; also in rush-pastures, wet meadows, flushed grassland on hill-slopes and, rarely, in wet woodland rides. 0-1005 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|C. echinata, which was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, was lost from many lowland squares in England in the 19th century. Since then, and since 1962, there have been further losses through drainage and agricultural improvements. The distribution is stable elsewhere.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Carex elata|A tussock-forming perennial herb of oligotrophic or mesotrophic (sometimes eutrophic) marshy habitats, often calcareous, including fens, the margins of lakes, ponds, rivers and canals, ditches prone to seasonal flooding, and wet Alnus or Salix woodland. Lowland.|Native|C. elata is now much better recorded than for the 1962 Atlas, especially in Ireland. There have been losses, particularly in East Anglia, from drainage and ditch widening.|Eurasian Temperate element.
Carex elongata|A perennial herb of wet woodlands, especially those dominated by Alnus and those on lake shores, but also found on pond margins, in ditches and seasonally flooded areas, and in wet meadows. In favourable conditions it can form large, loose tussocks and it sets seed freely in more open situations. Lowland.|Native|Some populations of C. elongata which were recorded before 1930 have been lost because of drainage and other forms of habitat destruction. The distribution is otherwise stable, and the species is better recorded in Ireland than in the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © L. Rooney
Carex ericetorum|A perennial herb restricted to dry, grazed grasslands; it occurs on infertile calcareous soils overlying limestone, chalk or chalky boulder-clay. It is a poor competitor and soon disappears if under-grazing allows the sward to become too rank. It reproduces vegetatively and by seed, albeit sparingly. Lowland, reaching 400 m near Shap (Westmorland).|Native|C. ericetorum may be under-recorded, being very similar to C. caryophyllea. However, it has clearly declined, losses being due to ploughing, lack of grazing and nutrient enrichment from adjoining arable land.|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Carex extensa|A perennial herb, mainly confined to areas within reach of sea water or spray. It is found on muddy or sandy estuarine flats, at the uppermost levels of saltmarshes and the edges of brackish ditches, and on moist coastal rocks and low cliffs. It often grows with C. distans. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of C. extensa since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Carex filiformis|This rhizomatous perennial herb occurs on calcium-rich soils in a wide range of habitats. It is most characteristic of damp meadows, but is also found in dry grassland, grassy woodland rides and along roadsides. Lowland.|Native|C. filiformis is vulnerable to agricultural improvement, and some sites have been lost since the 1962 Atlas, though the situation now seems to have stabilised and all of its 13 extant sites have some degree of protection.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Carex flacca|A rhizomatous perennial herb of unshaded neutral and calcareous grasslands over a wide range of substrates including chalk, limestone, sand and clay, and a frequent pioneer of disturbed bare areas. It is tolerant of both damp and dry conditions, and also occurs in wet meadows, on spray-drenched sea-cliffs, on the uppermost parts of saltmarshes, in base-rich mountain flushes and on rock ledges. Generally lowland, but reaching 790 m on Mt Brandon (S. Kerry).|Native|The distribution of C. flacca has not changed since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Carex flava|This perennial is found in the transition zone between woodland and raised mire, growing on peaty soil flushed by calcareous water from adjacent limestone outcrops. An open canopy or light shade is preferred. Lowland.|Native|C. flava has been confirmed from only one site, Roudsea Wood (Westmorland). Its favoured conditions of dappled shade are maintained by judicious thinning of the tree canopy. Hybrids between C. flava and C. viridula have been recorded from Greywell Moors (N. Hants.), Malham Tarn (Mid-W. Yorks.) and R. Corrib near Menlough (N.E. Galway), suggesting that C. flava might formerly have been more widespread.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in C. Asia and N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Carex hirta|Found in a wide variety of damp, grassy habitats, this rhizomatous perennial herb is particularly common in areas influenced by man: waste ground, tracksides, roadside verges and hedge-banks. It is also frequent, however, in rough grassland, hayfields, and occasionally sand dunes, marshes and damp, open woods. It avoids highly acidic, infertile soils. 0-470 m (Hartside, Cumberland).|Native|The range and frequency of C. hirta are likely to have been stable over many years, and the distribution is similar to that mapped in the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Carex hostiana|A perennial herb of damp, base-rich grassland and flushes. It occurs in fens, flushed valley bogs and mires, wet meadows and marshes. In lowland areas of Ireland it tolerates more acidic sites (Webb & Scannell, 1983). 0?630 m (Melmerby High Scar, Cumberland) and 760 m in W. Ross.|Native|C. hostiana was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined, particularly in S. England and S. Ireland, and analysis of the database reveals most losses have occurred since 1950. In upland areas, the distribution is more stable.|European Temperate element; also in N. America.
Carex humilis|A perennial herb of closely-grazed, calcareous grassland, especially on steep slopes on chalk downland. Over limestone it also occurs locally in grazed pastures as well as on field margins, track-sides and rock outcrops. It fruits freely, but regeneration from seed and spread into new areas has only rarely been reported. Lowland.|Native|The overall distribution of C. humilis is stable, but detailed studies in Dorset have revealed that over 10% of its recorded sites have been ploughed up (Pearman, 1997). Many extant sites now have some form of statutory protection, but the smaller ones are often ungrazed.|Eurasian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K. Marston, IWNHAS
Carex lachenalii|A perennial herb occurring on wet, acidic, N.-facing slopes and rock ledges, and in nutrient-poor flushes, especially in areas of late snow-lie. Montane, from 950 m on Cairn Toul (S. Aberdeen), but formerly lower in Glen Coe, to 1150 m on Ben Macdui (S. Aberdeen).|Native|The distribution of C. lachenalii seems to be stable, although some sites are very remote; it may still be present in some squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Carex laevigata|This perennial herb characteristically grows in moist woodlands on heavy clay soils, often where there is some flushing with base-rich water. Although most frequent in shaded sites, it is sometimes found in more open situations, such as on the edges of reedbeds, in open woodland on hillsides, or occasionally in open grassy flushes and damp meadows. It is a plant of low or moderate altitudes, but ascends to about 410 m in the Slaheny Valley (Co. Kerry).|Native|The distribution of this species has undergone little change since the 1962 Atlas.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Carex lasiocarpa|This rhizomatous perennial grows in reed-swamps and other vegetation at the edges of lakes, pools and slow-flowing streams and rivers, and in flushes and wet hollows in fens; it can also colonise old peat workings and drainage channels. It generally occurs in nutrient-poor water, which may be base-rich or base-poor. 0-650 m (E. of Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth).|Native|Some C. lasiocarpa localities were lost to drainage before 1930, and since the 1962 Atlas there have been further declines in East Anglia, and in other areas of lowland England and E. Ireland. Conversely, more intensive fieldwork has revealed many new 10-km squares elsewhere.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Carex limosa|A perennial herb of Sphagnum mires and the wet, peaty margins of pools, often growing in standing water. Most of its sites are acidic and oligotrophic, but unlike C. magellanica, it tends to occur in areas subject to some mineral enrichment. Generally lowland, but reaching 830 m on Meall nan Tarmachan (Mid Perth).|Native|C. limosa is now much better recorded than it was in the 1962 Atlas, and the distribution is probably stable, at least in Wales, Scotland and W. & N. Ireland. In England and C. Ireland it was lost from many lowland sites before 1930, and this decline has continued due to drainage, afforestation and, in Ireland, peat extraction.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Carex magellanica|A perennial of wet ground, pools and hummocks in Sphagnum bogs, or at the edges of gently sloping mires where there is slight lateral water movement; such sites often occur on watersheds. It generally occurs in open ground, but sometimes persists in carr. From 30 m (Shian, Mid Perth), but generally upland, reaching 685 m (Ben Lui, Main Argyll).|Native|C. magellanica is thinly scattered in suitable habitats. Some colonies have been lost as a result of drainage and afforestation but many new sites have been found, particularly in Wales, where it was collected c. 1835 but not refound until 1963, in Main Argyll and in N. Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Carex maritima|A rhizomatous perennial herb found in short vegetation in damp dune-slacks and on open sand, often close to freshwater seepages or where streams debouch onto the shore. It is mobile and can colonise new sites with suitable habitat. Populations can be very large. Lowland.|Native|C. maritima suffered a considerable decline before 1930. Assessments of more recent trends are difficult because it is a very inconspicuous and under-recorded species. Further fieldwork is required to establish its current distribution. It is probably lost from St. Andrews golf course (Fife) where it was abundant in 1984.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Carex microglochin|A shortly-rhizomatous perennial herb of base-rich flushes on gently sloping or `stepped` ground on micaceous silt or gravel. Also, occasionally, on steep burn-sides downstream of large colonies. Reproduction appears to be mainly vegetative. Between 610 m and 975 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|Regular monitoring since the 1980s has shown little change in the distribution of the many colonies of C. microglochin within the only 10-km square from which it is recorded.|European Arctic-montane element; also in C. Asia and N. & S. America.
Carex montana|This perennial herb was thought to be confined to rough, open grassland on limestone. However, recent studies have shown that it grows at these sites only where non-calcareous drift overlays the calcareous bedrock, and it can in fact thrive in neutral to acidic grassland, on heathland and in woodland rides, often in partial shade. Generally lowland, but reaching 560 m at Carreg yr Ogof (Carms.).|Native|The recognition of the wider ecological amplitude of C. montana has led to its discovery in many additional 10-km squares since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; also in C. and E. Asia.
Carex muricata||||
Carex nigra|C. nigra occurs in a wide range of wet habitats, avoiding only those which are extremely basic or acidic. It is found in fens, fen-meadows, bogs, streamsides and flushes, wet grassland and dune-slacks. This sedge is morphologically very variable: tussock forms may occur in stagnant, acidic sites, and rhizomatous tufted variants are known from calcareous mires. 0-1005 m (Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth).|Native|Mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, the distribution of C. nigra seems stable other than in S.E. England, where it is has declined because of drainage.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.
Carex norvegica|C. norvegica is a perennial herb of wet, stony slopes, ledges and turf over basic rock and with base-rich run-off. All the sites have a mainly N.-facing aspect, and occur in places where snow lies late. Populations are usually quite small and of very limited extent. From 700 m at Corrie Fee (Angus) to 975 m on Beinn Heasgarnich (Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of C. norvegica is stable, but it has recently been discovered in a new locality in W. Perth.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Carex ornithopoda|A perennial herb of skeletal, well-drained soils on S.-facing slopes overlying Carboniferous limestone. It grows in open grassland, on rocky outcrops, screes, crags and limestone pavements, and occasionally also in partial shade in open limestone woodland. Lowland to 600 m on Long Fell, Warcop (Westmorland).|Native|C. ornithopoda is still very localised, but its known range has been extended since the 1962 Atlas by discoveries in Cumberland and Yorkshire. Populations may be increasing in Westmorland, but plants are often vulnerable to intensive grazing by sheep.|European Boreal-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Carex otrubae|A perennial of wet habitats, usually on heavy soils. It is found on the sides of streams and ponds, in ditches, swamps, wet lowland meadows and pastures, at the upper edge of saltmarshes, and, less commonly, on damp roadsides and hedge banks. In N. England and Scotland it is essentially a coastal plant. It generally grows in slightly drier conditions than C. vulpina, tending to avoid standing water. Lowland.|Native|The overall distribution of C. otrubae is little changed since the 1962 Atlas, though loss of habitat through drainage has caused some local declines, for example in Dorset (Pearman, 1994).|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Carex ovalis|A tufted perennial herb, especially of acidic grassland, frequent in upland pastures, Nardus grassland and Calluna moorland. It is also common on lowland heaths, in damp meadows, woodland rides and edges, in ruderal habitats, and sometimes in moderately base-rich flushes and dune-slacks. It can be frequent in meadows which have been improved, and have then regressed. 0-1005 m (Lochnagar, S. Aberdeen).|Native|C. ovalis was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.

Carex paniculata|This tussock-forming perennial herb occurs in a wide range of habitats, usually somewhat base-enriched, including swamps and fens, the edges of lakes, ponds, canals and ditches, open fen-carr and swampy woodland. It usually grows in the open, where it fruits freely, but tolerates moderate shade, although it can become smaller and less vigorous, flowering only sparsely. Generally lowland, but to over 600 m on Gylchedd (Denbs.).|Native|The range of C. paniculata is stable. However, its frequency has decreased and it has been lost from many sites and is threatened in others, such as in Broadland where `tussock-fens` have ceased to develop.|European Temperate element.     © P.

Carex pauciflora|A perennial herb of wet, acidic, oligotrophic raised and blanket bogs, often growing on and around hummocks and usually in association with Sphagnum species. Lowland to 650 m (Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth) and 820 m elsewhere in Scotland.|Native|The range of C. pauciflora has changed very little since the 1962 Atlas. It is a very inconspicuous species and is easily overlooked, so it is probably present in many 10-km squares for which only pre-1987 records are available.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Carex pendula|A perennial herb usually growing on damp base-rich, heavy (often clay) soils, in shaded habitats. It is found in deciduous woodland, by ditches, ponds, streams, in hedgerows and on track-sides. Reproduction by seed can be prolific. Lowland, but exceptionally at 410 m at Alston (Cumberland).|Native|C. pendula has shown a very pronounced northerly expansion since the 1962 Atlas. It is now widely grown in gardens as an ornamental plant, and often escapes, so that the limits of its native range are totally obscure; all records are mapped here as if they are native.|European Southern-temperate element.

Carex pseudocyperus|A pioneer species of wet mud and shallow water, found in a wide variety of habitats including the edges of lakes, ponds, reservoirs, rivers, ditches, canals and backwaters. It also occurs in reedswamps and tall-herb fens, and readily colonises sand-, gravel-, clay- and marl-pits. It is shade-tolerant, and is found in swampy Alnus woods and Salix carr. Reproduction is by seed. Lowland.|Native|C. pseudocyperus was lost from many squares in Ireland before 1930. It has declined across much of its British range, but particularly in S.E. and E. England, since the 1962 Atlas. It is sometimes planted at the edge of ponds.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; also in E. Asia and N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Carex pulicaris|A perennial herb of damp or wet neutral or calcareous soils, and of more acidic soils where these are flushed by mineral-enriched groundwater. Habitats include short-sedge mires, damp meadows and pastures, fen-meadows, wet heaths, flushes and springs, montane rock ledges and Dryas heath. It also occurs, albeit rarely, on N.-facing slopes in chalk and limestone districts. 0-915 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry, and W. Ross).|Native|The distribution of C. pulicaris in N. and W. Britain and Ireland is largely unchanged. Elsewhere, losses from the lowlands, already apparent in the 1962 Atlas, have accelerated through drainage and the destruction of damp meadows and pastures.|Suboceanic Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Carex punctata|A perennial herb of sheltered rock ledges and clefts on sea-cliffs, invariably in seepage zones where freshwater trickles down the cliff-face. It is also found on wet sandy patches in saltmarshes, and amongst rocks or on sand where streams debouch onto the shore. It occurs in similar habitats to C. distans, and may sometimes be mistaken for it. Lowland.|Native|C. punctata tends to be rather mobile and is often present in small populations. However, the overall distribution appears to be largely stable, and recent recording has led to the discovery of many new sites within its known range.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Carex rariflora|A perennial herb of wet, base-poor peaty substrates, mainly occurring in flush-bogs on gentle slopes, often in areas of late snow-lie or by streams flowing from them. It also occurs by pools, and on terraces by the side of incised burns. From 790 m in Drumochter Forest (Westerness) to 1125 m at Lochan Bhuidhe and Ben Macdui (both Banffs.).|Native|Many new sites for C. rariflora have been discovered since the 1962 Atlas, some of them very extensive, and more than thirty populations are now known.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.     © Pete Stroh
Carex recta|A rhizomatous perennial found in marshes along the lower reaches and estuaries of the Wick River (Caithness), the River Beauly and the Kyle of Sutherland (both E. Ross), growing in places where silt is periodically deposited or where the water-table fluctuates. It sets few viable seeds and reproduction is mostly vegetative. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of C. recta is unchanged since the 1962 Atlas, but the population on the Beauly River has declined considerably since the 1980s. Faulkner (1972) considered that this taxon probably arose through hybridisation of C. aquatilis and the Scandinavian species C. paleacea.|Oceanic Boreal-montane element; also in N. America.
Carex remota|A tufted perennial herb of damp woodland and woodland rides, often growing in considerable shade. It can become dominant in favoured habitats, such as in woods that are seasonally flooded. Generally lowland, but reaching 320 m in Swaledale (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|There has been no significant change in the overall distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Carex riparia|This rhizomatous perennial is found in reed-swamps, on the edges of pools and lakes, in marshy areas and wet woodland, and along the banks of slow-flowing rivers and canals. It is a species of base-rich, mesotrophic or eutrophic sites. Reproduction is mainly vegetative, but new colonies can arise from seed. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of C. riparia is broadly similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas, and the plant is much better recorded in Ireland. Records from N.W. Scotland have been treated as errors. It is sometimes planted by ponds, and some records mapped as native may refer to such introductions.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Carex rostrata|A rhizomatous perennial herb found in emergent stands on the edges of lakes and ponds, rivers and streams, in ditches, swamps, fens and bog pools, wet meadows, flush-bogs on hillsides, sea-cliff flushes, wet dune-slacks, and Alder and Salix carr. It usually grows in oligotrophic or mesotrophic, acidic waters, though it also occurs in nutrient-poor calcareous conditions. 0?1040 m (Creag Meagaidh, Westerness).|Native|The distribution of C. rostrata is stable except in S.E. England. Here, it had been lost from some sites before 1930 and further losses have occurred because of drainage and habitat reclamation.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Carex rupestris|A perennial herb of basic substrates on cliff ledges and crevices, and on broken rocky or grassy slopes, always over base-rich rocks. It is often a shy flowerer, and it sometimes grows with C. pulicaris with which it can be easily confused. Found near sea level in N.W. Scotland, but usually from 600 m, to 935 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|C. rupestris is now better recorded than it was for the 1962 Atlas, particularly in N.W. Scotland.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.     © Pete Stroh
Carex saxatilis|This rhizomatous perennial herb is usually, but not exclusively, found on base-rich substrates, in areas where there is little water movement. It occurs on flat mountain tops and gentle slopes, and in damp flushes and hollows where snow lies late. From 460 m in Glen Clunie (S. Aberdeen) to 1125 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of C. saxatilis is unlikely to have changed markedly, and it is possibly still present in many 10-km squares for which there are only pre-1987 records. It is under little threat, and is now better recorded than it was when mapped by Stewart et al. (1994).|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.
Carex spicata|A perennial herb of rough grasslands, roadsides, railway embankments, hedge banks, woodland rides and clearings, open scrub and waste ground. It is a plant of moist, neutral or slightly base-rich, heavy soils, and cannot withstand much competition. Lowland.|Native|This species was previously confused with C. muricata subsp. lamprocarpa, but a clear account of the differences was provided by Jermy et al. (1982) and it is now known to be more common in N.W. England and W. Scotland than indicated in the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Carex strigosa|A perennial herb of moist, base-rich, sometimes clayey, soils in deciduous or mixed woodlands, often found near streams or seepages. It occurs most frequently in clearings and along tracks, but is sometimes found in considerable shade. Lowland.|Native|C. strigosa is easily overlooked, and it is better recorded now than in the 1962 Atlas. Many sites were lost before 1930, particularly in Ireland. Since 1962 its distribution has been stable other than in Sussex and Kent, where there has been a noteworthy decline, the reasons for which are unclear.|Suboceanic Temperate element.
Carex sylvatica|This perennial herb is found in a wide range of woodland habitats, generally preferring those where there is some base-enrichment and where the soil is moist and clayey. In many woods it is particularly frequent along the sides of paths or rutted tracks. It is occasionally found in open scrub and damp grassland, but likely to be a woodland relic in such places. Generally lowland, but reaching 565 m on Ben Bulben (Co. Sligo), and reportedly at 640 m in the Scottish Highlands.|Native|There has been no significant change in the distribution of C. sylvatica since the 1962 Atlas, and it is now better recorded.|Eurasian Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Carex vaginata|A rhizomatous perennial herb of flushed, moderately basic to slightly acidic mountain grassland; also found in flush bogs and on rock ledges. It can be locally abundant and form large patches by rhizomatous growth, but is a shy flowerer and for that reason may often be overlooked. From 370 m at Creag an Eirionnaich near Blair Atholl (Mid Perth) to 1150 m on Cairn Toul (S. Aberdeen), but usually found above 700 m.|Native|The overall distribution of C. vaginata is stable.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Carex vesicaria|A perennial herb of wet habitats, mainly mesotrophic and at least slightly basic, occurring where the water table lies close to or above the soil surface. It is found by lakes, rivers, streams, ponds and canals, in marshes and swamps, ditches, wet meadows and depressions in pasture, and in wet woodland. It also colonises wet hollows in disused sand-, gravel- and clay-pits. 0-455 m (Llyn Gorast, Cards.).|Native|C. vesicaria has been lost from many sites in England and S.E. Ireland since the 1962 Atlas. Causes of this decline in Britain include drainage, falling water tables, ditch cleaning and eutrophication.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Carex viridula||||
Carex viridula subsp.brachyrrhyncha|A perennial herb of fens and calcareous mires, especially in areas of winter flooding. It is also frequent base-rich flushes and wet ledges on sea-cliffs, hills and mountainsides, usually in short, open vegetation. 0?775 m (Coire nan Laogh, Glen Banchory, Easterness).|Native|The map shows many more records of this subspecies than in the 1962 Atlas but there have been local losses, particularly in S. England, presumably arising from drainage and agricultural improvements. Populations in many lowland areas are small.|European Temperate element; also in eastern N. America.
Carex viridula subsp.oedocarpa|This perennial grows on wet ground on soils ranging from acidic to neutral or occasionally mildly alkaline. It is found in a wide variety of open habitats, including sandy shores, tracks, streamsides, wet fields and heathland, the margins of ponds and lakes, wet rocky hillsides, flushes and seepage areas. 0?930 m (Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth).|Native|This, the most widespread of the C. viridula subspecies, was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It is now much better recorded but it has declined at the edges of its range in S. England, and in the English and Irish Midlands, almost certainly due to drainage and habitat loss.|Suboceanic Boreo-temperate element; also in eastern N. America.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Carex viridula subsp.viridula|This perennial herb occurs in open, damp or wet habitats, including dune-slacks, the upper edge of saltmarshes and on the stony margins of lakes or pools, and in open fens and marshes. It usually occurs on flushed acidic soils, but also locally on base-rich substrates. Lowland, but possibly to 400 m in Perthshire.|Native|A diminutive plant which is easily overlooked, C. viridula subsp. viridula is known to be more frequent than when mapped by Jermy et al. (1982) and is probably still under-recorded in W. Scotland and Ireland.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in E. Asia and widespread in N. America.
Carex vulpina|A perennial herb of wet, open or shaded habitats, usually on heavy clay soils that are flooded in winter and dry in summer. It occurs by ditches and rivers, in meadows and in a Quercus-Crataegus thicket. It sometimes grows in standing water. Plants fruit freely. Lowland.|Native|There is much confusion regarding the separation of this species from C. otrubae. Despite apparent differences in leaf anatomy, preliminary molecular analysis has revealed that the situation is not clear-cut, and taxonomic work continues. Distributional changes are, therefore, not easily assessed.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © L. Rooney
Carlina vulgaris|A monocarpic perennial herb, typically occurring in well-grazed grassland on dry, infertile calcareous or base-rich soils, but also in more open habitats, including dry rock ledges, screes, quarry floors, coastal cliffs and sand dunes. 0-455 m (Haweswater, Westmorland).|Native|C. vulgaris was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. A widespread decline has taken place, and analysis of the database reveals that most losses have occurred since 1950. Losses are partly due to habitat destruction and a lack of grazing. It has declined on dunes in Co. Down through their destruction and acidification.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Carpinus betulus|A long-lived deciduous tree, found as native in both pure and mixed woodland on base-poor sandy or loamy clays, or clay-with-flints. Within its native range, coppiced plants are often the dominant member of the shrub layer in Quercus woods. It is also extensively planted in woodlands, on roadsides, in amenity areas and for hedging, both within and outside its native range. Lowland as a native, but to 380 m as an alien on Great Mell Fell (Cumberland).|Native|C. betulus is confined as a native to S.E. England. Its precise native range has not been defined and all records are mapped as if they are native. There are many more alien records since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.     © S. Hammonds
Carpobrotus edulis|A succulent, mat-forming perennial which may cover sea-cliffs and sand dunes, or hang down rocks and walls. Some colonies were planted to stabilise dunes, while others have arisen from discarded garden material. Reproduction by seed is probably insignificant. Vegetative spread can be assisted by nesting gulls. It is frost-sensitive. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. edulis was being cultivated in gardens by c. 1690, but was not recorded in the wild until 1886. It has spread since the 1962 Atlas but is limited by climate. It is perceived as a serious threat to native species on Cornish cliffs and much effort is spent on its attempted eradication.|Native of S. Africa; widely naturalised in Mediterranean-Atlantic regions of Europe.     © P. Shannon
Carum carvi|A monocarpic perennial herb, found naturalised in meadows, on sand dunes, roadsides and railway banks, and as a casual in waste places and on rubbish tips. Generally lowland, but formerly reaching 425 m at Blair Atholl (E. Perth).|Archaeophyte|C. carvi was introduced from Europe before 1375 (Harvey, 1981). It is well-naturalised in Shetland, but is uncommon elsewhere, being much less frequently cultivated than formerly. Many occurrences are casual, presumably arising from fruits imported as flavouring agents.|Apparently native of Europe, W. & C. Asia but native range obscured by spread in cultivation; now widespread in boreal and temperate zones in the N. hemisphere.
Carum verticillatum|A perennial, calcifuge herb of marshes, streamsides, damp meadows, rushy pastures and on wet hillsides with a pronounced soligenous influence. 0-425 m (Llyn Berwyn, Cards.) and 440 m in S. Kerry.|Native|The distribution of this species is generally stable. Since the 1962 Atlas, some sites have been lost, including the remaining Surrey site in 1967. However, new sites have been discovered, particularly in S. Wales, N. & W. Scotland and Ireland. In W. Scotland, and perhaps elsewhere, it may be becoming more frequent in pastures where drainage is increasingly neglected.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Castanea sativa|This deciduous tree is a major constituent of coppiced woodland in S.E. England. It is also planted in hedgerows, wood-borders, parkland and amenity areas, and in large gardens. It tolerates a wide range of soils, but thrives on moist, sandy soils. Seed is set freely in the south, but seedlings rarely reach maturity. 0-410 m (Fern Hill, Rads.).|Archaeophyte|C. sativa was probably introduced in Roman times, and its later presence is attested by Anglo-Saxon place names and its mention in Medieval documents. The large increase in records since the 1962 Atlas is due to better recording and continued planting.|Native of S. Europe, N. Africa & S.W. Asia; widely naturalised in W. Europe.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Catabrosa aquatica|A stoloniferous herb of muddy pond margins, cattle-poached ditches, canals and sluggish streams; also, as var. uniflora, on wet open sand by the sea. Almost entirely lowland, but recorded in flushes at 710 m on Little Fell (Westmorland).|Native|C. aquatica has much declined since the 1962 Atlas, due to the drainage and infilling of ponds, and the canalisation of lowland watercourses. However, var. uniflora is widespread in W. and N.W. Scotland, perhaps also in W. Ireland, and is undoubtedly more common than indicated by the map in Perring & Sell (1968).|European Boreo-temperate element; also in C. Asia and N. America.
Catapodium marinum|An annual of dry bare places by the sea, rock crevices, grassy banks, cliff-tops, sand dunes and stabilised shingle; also in artificial habitats such as walls and pavements, and increasingly inland by salt-treated roads. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of C. marinum since the 1962 Atlas, apart from its recent colonisation of roadsides near the coast, mainly in S. England and along the M4 motorway in S. Wales. It was first recorded in that habitat in the mid-1980s, though only since the mid-1990s has it begun to spread appreciably.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Catapodium rigidum|An annual of dry, barish places on sandy banks, stabilised shingle and around rock outcrops, usually preferring calcareous substrates; also in artificial habitats such as quarries, walls, pavements and railway ballast. 0-355 m (Llangollen, Denbs.).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of C. rigidum since the 1962 Atlas. Subsp. majus, a coastal plant of S.W. Britain, Ireland and the Channel Islands, was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968), but it is treated as a variety by Stace (1997) and is not mapped separately here.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © P. Shannon
Centaurea calcitrapa|A biennial herb of waste ground and tracksides in dry grassland, and on banks on well-drained sandy, gravelly or light chalky soils. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|There is a single archaeological record of this species from a Roman site, and it was recorded in the historic period by 1597. It is sometimes regarded as native in Sussex, where it grows in habitats similar to those near the Somme estuary in N. France (Wigginton, 1999). It is also established in Kent, where it has been known since 1839 at Chatham. Elsewhere it is a declining casual from wool, bird-seed, lucerne seed and esparto.|Native of the Mediterranean region; widespread as an introduction further north but now declining outside its native range.
Centaurea cyanus|C. cyanus formerly occurred as an annual weed of arable habitats. Since 1986 it has been recorded in very few arable fields, but it is now frequent in waste places, on roadsides and on rubbish tips as a casual arising from gardens and wild-flower seed mixtures. 0-350 m (Blackwell, Derbys.).|Archaeophyte|Known to have been present in Britain from the Iron Age onwards, C. cyanus remained a serious weed until seed cleaning began a rapid decline, accelerated by the use of herbicides. Since the 1980s it has increased through wild-flower seed.|As an archaeophyte C. cyanus has a distribution centred on the European Temperate region; it has been widely naturalised outside this range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Centaurea nigra|A perennial herb of meadows and pastures, sea-cliffs, roadsides, railway banks, scrub, woodland edges, field borders and waste ground, on a wide range of soils. 0-580 m (Cadair Idris, Merioneth) and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of C. nigra is stable. Forms on light soils in England and Wales are sometimes recognised as subsp. nemoralis. Elsewhere, subsp. nigra predominates. Intermediates occur where both subspecies grow, and also in the absence of subsp. nemoralis.|Suboceanic Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © R. Stewart, IWNHAS
Centaurea scabiosa|A tufted, winter-green, perennial herb of dry, usually calcareous soils, found in grassland, scrub and woodland edges, on cliffs, roadsides, railway banks, quarries and waste ground. 0-320 m (Matlock, Derbys.).|Native|C. scabiosa has apparently declined due to the destruction of old grasslands, although it is able to colonise disturbed habitats. Plants with entire basal leaves, var. succisifolia, are found in coastal populations in Wales and Scotland, but their taxonomic status is uncertain (Valentine, 1980).|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P.

Centaurium erythraea|A biennial, rarely annual, herb of mildly acidic to calcareous, well-drained, often disturbed, soils, occurring in a wide range of habitats including chalk and limestone grassland, heathland, woodland rides and open scrub, dune grassland, quarries, spoil-heaps and road verges. 0-330 m (Wauchope, Roxburghs.).|Native|The distribution of this ecologically wide-ranging and mobile species shows little change from the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Centaurium littorale|This biennial herb is confined to coastal dunes, the uppermost levels of saltmarshes and calcareous, humus-rich turf near the sea where competing vegetation is checked and the habitat kept open by grazing or trampling. Lowland.|Native|There appears to be little change in the overall distribution of C. littorale since the 1962 Atlas; although some populations have been lost, new ones have been discovered.|European Temperate element.
Centaurium pulchellum|An erect annual of mildly acidic to calcareous soils. Inland it is found in dry, open grasslands and heaths, in woodland rides, marl pits and other open, disturbed ground. On the coast it is a plant of open sandy and muddy grassy places, often by estuaries, sand dunes and in upper saltmarsh. Lowland.|Native|The overall distribution of this species has remained stable although there has been some decline on heathland due to lack of management (particularly grazing), and coastal development has led to the loss of some of its former sites. It is much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Centaurium scilloides|This perennial herb occurs on freely draining soils on the slopes of coastal cliffs. Most native populations are in grassland and maritime dwarf-shrub heath, often along eroded and trampled edges, with some extending into dune grassland. In S.E. England it occurs in lawns at both coastal and inland sites. Lowland.|Native|The decline of grazing and invasion of scrub are likely causes for the disappearance of this species from Cornwall, where it was first seen in the 1950s. The first record from lawns in S.E. England was made in 1974. In these localities it may be an escape from cultivation.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element; restricted to disjunct localities along the coast of W. Europe.
Centaurium tenuiflorum|This annual occurs on open, poorly drained sandy or clayey soils on slumping coastal cliffs. It will not persist in a closed sward, tending to appear a few years after the habitat is opened up, and disappear after about ten years unless open conditions are re-created. Lowland.|Native|Though this species is rare and very localised, the unstable nature of its habitat should ensure its survival in Dorset. It was last recorded in the Isle of Wight in 1953; later records from here are errors. It was recorded in the Channel Islands in 1837, but not subsequently.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Centranthus ruber|A perennial herb thoroughly naturalised on sea-cliffs, limestone rock outcrops and pavements, rocky waste ground, in quarries, on railway banks, on old walls and buildings, and in other well-drained, disturbed and open habitats. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. ruber was grown in Britain by 1597 and is a popular garden plant. It was first recorded in the wild in 1763 (Cambs.). There are many more records for this species than when it was mapped in the 1962 Atlas, although its range has not changed significantly.|Native of S.W. Europe and the Mediterranean region; widely naturalised further north in W. & C. Europe.     © P. Shannon
Cephalanthera damasonium|A shade-loving rhizomatous perennial herb usually found in woods with little ground cover, especially those of Fagus, but also extending into chalk scrub. It is restricted to well-drained soils on chalk and oolitic limestone. It is usually self-pollinated and the flowers often fail to open entirely. Lowland.|Native|Clearance of woodland, particularly since 1930, has resulted in the loss of many sites for C. damasonium. It is still plentiful, however, in suitable habitats, and its ability to colonise young Fagus plantations means that new populations are occasionally found.|European Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Cephalanthera longifolia|A rhizomatous perennial herb found in a variety of woodland types on calcareous soils, usually on chalk and hard limestone but also on calcareous schist in Scotland. It prefers permanent patches of light and is most frequent on steep, rocky slopes with an open tree canopy, but is also found along woodland edges and rides, and in scrub. Lowland.|Native|This species declined markedly in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially before 1970. Although collecting may have contributed to some losses (Graham, 1988), cessation of woodland management and coniferisation, both leading to denser canopies, are much more significant.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.
Cephalanthera rubra|A long-lived rhizomatous perennial herb of well-drained sloping sites in deciduous woods, particularly those of Fagus, on calcareous soils. It is a poor competitor and does not form large colonies. Flowers are rarely produced and seed-set is very low, possibly due to the rarity of suitable pollinators. Lowland.|Native|This elusive species has always been rare and is now found at only three sites, with a total of perhaps only thirty plants. Current conservation management includes removal of shrubs and trees. Native populations may soon be augmented with plants grown ex situ.|European Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Cerastium alpinum|A mat-forming montane perennial herb which grows in similar habitats to C. arcticum, but on more strongly basic rocks. It is particularly abundant on soft mica-schists but also occurs on limestone and, rarely, serpentine. It often occurs in species-rich dwarf-herb communities. From 300 m on Seana Bhraigh (E. Ross) to 1210 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|C. alpinum may still be present in many of the 10-km squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|European Arctic-montane element; also in N. America.     © Pete Stroh
Cerastium arcticum|A montane, tufted perennial herb of acidic and hard basic rocks. It normally occurs in wet, thinly-vegetated crevices and on ledges in N.-facing corries, but has been recorded on a montane fell-field on Skye. Plants may sometimes be found rooted at the foot of mountain cliffs. It is rarely found below 700 m and reaches 1200 m on Ben Nevis (Westerness).|Native|The map shows no appreciable change in the distribution of C. arcticum since the 1962 Atlas.|European Arctic-montane element, but absent from mountains of C. Europe; also in N. America.
Cerastium arvense|This perennial grows mainly on dry, calcareous to slightly acid, sandy soils, occurring in pastures, on dry roadsides, wayside banks, the margins of arable fields, sandy or gravelly waste ground, sand dunes and sand-pits. 0-300 m (Hounam Law, Roxburghs.).|Native|C. arvense has declined, particularly at the edges of its range. The reasons for this are unclear.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © O. Pescott
Cerastium brachypetalum|An annual of dry, calcareous, open grassland and railway banks. Seed is freely produced but is poorly dispersed, with colonies appearing in the same place year after year. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. brachypetalum was first discovered in Britain in Bedfordshire in 1947; its late discovery and proximity to railways suggest that it is an introduction. However, Palmer (1994) argued that its occurrence in old, Bromopsis erecta dominated grassland on chalk in W. Kent indicates that these populations are relics of a more widespread distribution in this area.|A European Southern-temperate species.
Cerastium cerastoides|A straggling, mat-forming montane perennial herb that grows on wet acidic rocks, often in areas of late snow-lie. It is usually found above 750 m and reaches an altitude of 1220 m on Ben Macdui (S. Aberdeen), but occurs at 335 m near Mar Lodge (S. Aberdeen).|Native|More sites have been discovered since the 1962 Atlas, but the general 10-km distribution seems stable. C. cerastoides may still be under-recorded.|European Arctic-montane element; also in C. Asia and N. America.
Cerastium diffusum|An annual of light, dry, sandy or gravelly soil. Coastal habitats include open grassland, fixed dunes, sandy banks and sheltered rock crevices. Inland, it occurs in a range of open habitats, including dry grassland, by paths, on wall-tops, road verges and railway ballast. 0-455 m (Dalnaspidal, E. Perth).|Native|There has been no change in the coastal distribution since the 1962 Atlas. It has declined in many inland railway sites, which it colonised during the Second World War, but this seems to have been offset to some extent by recent records from salt-treated roadsides.

Cerastium glomeratum|C. glomeratum grows in disturbed areas, often in places where there is some nutrient enrichment. It is fairly tolerant of trampling and is particularly common around farms, in gateways, on field edges, in bare patches in improved grassland, beside tracks and in waste places. It is also frequent on sand dunes and shingle. 0-610 m (Black`s Hope, Dumfriess.).|Native|There has been a large increase in records compared to the 1962 Atlas, especially in N. & W.

Cerastium nigrescens|A tufted perennial herb confined to two adjacent hills on very exposed, sparsely-vegetated fell-field of shattered serpentine rock. Although it grows to an altitude of only 80 m, the habitat has many similarities to more montane communities.|Native|The numbers of C. nigrescens fluctuate from year to year, for reasons that are unclear, but the underlying trend seems stable, and there has been no change in its distribution.|Endemic.
Cerastium pumilum|A winter-annual of chalk and limestone substrates, occurring mainly in open, barish patches within short-grazed grassland, especially on sunny banks and cliffs; also found as an alien in quarries, on spoil heaps and on ballast along railway lines (e.g. in Beds.). Lowland.|Native|Many of the sites in the eastern part of its range were lost before 1930, but C. pumilum has apparently decreased further here since the 1962 Atlas. It seems to be stable elsewhere, and now much better recorded in its core areas. However, because the plant resembles other Cerastium species, has a short season and fluctuates in numbers, it may perhaps be overlooked to some extent.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Cerastium semidecandrum|This annual or overwintering herb of well-drained, sandy or calcareous soils is found on dry banks and open, grassy places, on heathy ground, fixed dunes, disturbed sandy areas near the sea and walls. It also grows on rock ledges and bare places on limestone, and occasionally grows in heavier clay soils. 0-485 m (Isla, E. Perth).|Native|This species was under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas. The map presents a much improved illustration of its distribution, but it may remain poorly recorded in some areas.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Cerastium tomentosum|A spreading, mat-forming perennial herb naturalised on roadsides, railway banks, waste ground, tips, dunes and coastal shingle. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. tomentosum has been cultivated in Britain since 1648 and is now common in parks and gardens; records from the wild, the first of which was in 1915, are of garden escapes or plants originating from discarded material. There are five times as many 10-km square records of this species as in the 1962 Atlas and this probably results from both a genuine increase and the improved recording of aliens.|Native of Italy & Sicily; widely naturalised elsewhere in Europe.     © P. Shannon
Ceratocapnos claviculata|A climbing or scrambling annual of freely-draining acidic, mineral or peaty soils. It occurs in deciduous and coniferous woodland, especially in clearings and in recently felled areas, under Pteridium and in scrub, and occasionally over rock outcrops. In Ireland, it occurs on shaded boulder slopes. Generally lowland, but reaching 430 m on Deadwater Fell (S. Northumb.).|Native|The overall distribution of this species has not changed since the 1962 Atlas, although it is now much better recorded.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Ceratochloa carinata|A vigorous perennial herb, which is often short-lived or annual in Britain, found on road verges, towpaths, beside paths, on field-borders, waste ground and by rivers. It is cleistogamous, and seed can be produced almost all year round. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. carinata was apparently originally introduced as a fodder grass but is also a contaminant of agricultural seed. It was first recorded as an escape from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in about 1919, but it did not begin to spread until 1945. There were still only a very few records in the 1962 Atlas. Since then it has spread rapidly, particularly on lighter soils. The new cultivar `Deborah` was developed in c. 1975.|Native of western N. America.
Ceratochloa cathartica|A usually short-lived perennial, found on roadsides, waste ground and the borders of fields, and in arable crops. It normally occurs as a casual, but can become naturalised, especially in the Channel Islands and the Isles of Scilly. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. cathartica was introduced as a fodder grass in 1788, and also occurs as a grain- and wool-alien. It was first recorded in the wild in 1870, and may be increasing slowly.|Native of N. & S. America.
Ceratophyllum demersum|An aquatic which grows submerged in still or slowly flowing, eutrophic water in lakes, ponds, rivers, canals and ditches. It may be so abundant in ponds and ditches that it forms dense masses which rise above the water surface. Reproduction is mostly by vegetative fragmentation, but seeds are produced in still-water habitats in some years. Lowland.|Native|This species appears to be more frequent than shown in the 1962 Atlas. This probably reflects better recording of aquatic plants, but there is little doubt that because this species grows in eutrophic water its distribution is at least stable, if not increasing.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Ceratophyllum submersum|This aquatic grows in eutrophic or slightly brackish water in shallow, sheltered lakes, ponds and ditches. It is particularly frequent in coastal grazing marshes. Like C. demersum, reproduction is mostly by vegetative fragmentation and it can occur in dense masses, even in shaded ponds. Lowland.|Native|This species appears to be much more frequent now than at the time of the 1962 Atlas. Whereas the increase in records in coastal S.E. England probably reflects more detailed recording of grazing marshes, the increase in inland sites probably results from a genuine expansion. It was discovered in Ireland in 1989.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Ceterach officinarum|A perennial, calcicole fern found on crags and cliffs of basic rocks, especially limestone, and also on limestone pavements and mortared walls. Generally lowland, reaching c. 550 m in Wales.|Native|Historically this species has benefited from the built environment. There are many more records since the 1962 Atlas, particularly in E. Britain. Molecular evidence shows that the genus Ceterach should be subsumed into Asplenium.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element; also in C. Asia.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Chaenorhinum minus|A spring-germinating annual of open habitats on well-drained, often calcareous, soils, including cultivated fields, forestry tracks, on rough waste ground, old walls, quarries, and especially along railways. 0-425 m (Kirkstone Pass, Westmorland).|Archaeophyte|C. minus was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined in many areas, particularly in Ireland. It was once a familiar weed of cultivated farmland, but agricultural intensification has now rendered it much rarer in this habitat and it is now more likely to be found along railways and in railway yards.|As an archaeophyte C. minus has a European Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Chaerophyllum temulum|A biennial herb, especially characteristic of rank grassland on roadside verges, by hedges and along wood-borders and forest rides; also found on railway banks and in waste places. It tolerates light shade, but rarely occurs on damp and acidic soils. Reproduction is by seed. 0-365 m (Derbys. and Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|There has been little appreciable change in the distribution in Britain since the 1962 Atlas, but it seems to have declined in Ireland, where it is probably introduced (Scannell & Synnott, 1987).|European Temperate element.
Chamaecyparis lawsoniana|This evergreen tree is widely found in parks, gardens and churchyards, and in shelter-belts. It frequently regenerates from seed, and plants arise opportunistically on banks, walls and woodland margins. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. lawsoniana was introduced to Britain in 1854, and is now represented by a wide range of cultivars. It is less common in rural areas than in towns, but is sometimes recommended for underplanting in plantations. It is increasingly widespread, but was not formally recorded from the wild until 1958 (W. Kent).|Native of western N. America (California, Oregon); widely planted in Europe.
Chamaemelum nobile|A perennial herb found in moderately acidic, seasonally wet grassland, especially on sandy commons and pastures where mowing, trampling or grazing discourages competitors; also in coastal grassland and on cliffs, where exposure and trampling maintain a short sward. 0-465 m (near Priestleap, S. Kerry).|Native|C. nobile had decreased considerably by 1930, and this decline continues due to drainage and the cessation of grazing. In Dorset, for example, over 90% of the sites recorded in the 1930s had gone by 1993 (Byfield & Pearman, 1996). However, it remains stable in its core areas, and is better recorded now than when mapped by Stewart et al. (1994).|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Chamerion angustifolium|A rhizomatous perennial herb of moderately fertile soils, forming dense stands on disturbed, often burnt ground, on heaths, in woodland rides and clearings, on sand dunes, along tracksides, roadsides and railways, and in waste places; also in upland areas on rock ledges and screes. 0-975 m (Lochnagar, S. Aberdeen).|Native|This was a rare upland species in the early 19th century, but by the time of the 1962 Atlas its major extension of distribution in mainland Britain, perhaps originating from an overseas source, had already taken place. Since 1962 it has consolidated its range in Ireland. All records are mapped as if they are native.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Chelidonium majus|This perennial herb is widely naturalised by roadsides and paths, in the crevices of old walls, on waste ground and in hedge-bottoms. It was at one time cultivated as a medicinal plant, and most localities are near habitation. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Fossil evidence shows that C. majus has been present in Britain since Roman times. Although it is better recorded since the 1962 Atlas, the map suggests a decline at the edges of the range.|As an archaeophyte C. majus has a Eurasian Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Chenopodium album||||
Chenopodium album agg.|Annuals of disturbed, nutrient-rich habitats, including cultivated fields and gardens, manure heaps, waste ground, rubbish tips and soil heaps. Copious seed is produced, resulting in a long-lived seed bank. Generally lowland, but reaching 435 m in Clun Forest (Salop).|Native|Records of all eight species in the aggregate (species 20?27 in Stace, 1997) are included here, but C. album is by far the commonest. The distribution since the 1962 Atlas is stable in much of its range, though the decline in arable farming in W. Scotland has made it less frequent there.|Eurasian Wide-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-temperate.
Chenopodium bonus-henricus|A perennial, forming patches on disturbed, nutrient-rich soil around farm buildings and ruins, and on roadsides and waste ground. It also sometimes occurs in limestone grassland. 0-455 m (Helbeck Fell, Westmorland).|Archaeophyte|This species, present in Roman times, was once grown for its edible leaves. It can persist for many years but has decreased since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`, perhaps because it is no longer being introduced and populations are gradually lost through a general tidying of ruderal habitats.|Native to the mountains of C. & S. Europe, where it grows in late snow-patches; naturalised in much of temperate Europe and in N. America.
Chenopodium chenopodioides|An annual of dry, brackish mud of ditches, salt-pans and hoof-marks in the upper part of saltmarshes and in coastal grazing marshes. Lowland.|Native|Since the 1962 Atlas, there has been no change in the distribution of C. chenopodioides in its core area of the Thames estuary, but it seems to have become extinct in Suffolk and Norfolk. It requires traditional marsh grazing regimes, and many sites have been converted to arable, or have become unsuitable as water levels in ditches have been stabilised after drainage.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a coastal distribution in W. Europe but in inland saline areas further east. It is widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Chenopodium ficifolium|An annual of disturbed, nutrient-rich ground, especially cultivated land on deep, fertile soils. It is usually casual but can be persistent in S. England and S. Wales. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|There is a continuous archaeological record of this species in Britain from the Iron Age onwards. Despite this, there were very few records of it in the 1962 Atlas away from its strongholds in the Fens and the London area. Even allowing for the possibility that it had been under-recorded elsewhere, it seems likely that this species has undergone a marked expansion of range since the 1950s. The reasons for this are far from clear.|As an archaeophyte C. ficifolium has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Chenopodium glaucum|An annual of disturbed, nutrient-rich waste ground and manure heaps, and on damp ground near the sea; it is also recorded on rubbish tips and around docks and wharves. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|This species was first recorded in the wild in 1713. There has been a marked decline since the 1962 Atlas. Most records are of small, casual populations or even single plants.|A Circumpolar Temperate species, but absent from eastern N. America; widely naturalised elsewhere.     © F.C. Eccleston
Chenopodium hybridum|An annual of disturbed, nutrient-rich arable land and waste ground. It is a characteristic weed of humus-rich cultivated soils in the Fens. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|C. hybridum is known from archaeological evidence to have been present in Britain since Roman times. There has been no change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|As an archaeophyte C. hybridum has a Circumpolar Temperate distribution.
Chenopodium murale|An annual of disturbed, nutrient-rich cultivated and waste ground. Usually casual, it is long-established near the sea in S.E. England. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|C. murale has been present in Britain since Roman times. Like some other Chenopodium species it has declined markedly since the 1962 Atlas.|As an archaeophyte C. murale has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Chenopodium polyspermum|An annual of disturbed cultivated ground, including gardens, especially on light, nutrient-rich soils. It has also been recorded on bare peat, on disturbed soil in newly coppiced woodland and in dried up ponds. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|There has been no change in overall range since the 1962 Atlas, but there are many more records.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Chenopodium rubrum|An annual of nutrient-rich mud around the dried-up margins of freshwater or brackish ponds and ditches trampled by livestock; also, more widely, in cultivated and waste ground, on manure heaps and farm tracks and in field gateways. Lowland.|Native|There has been a marked increase in the distribution of this mobile species since the 1962 Atlas, particularly in East Anglia, C.S. England, S.W. Scotland and Ireland.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; also present as a native in western N. America and widely naturalised so that the distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Chenopodium urbicum|An annual of disturbed, nutrient-rich cultivated and waste ground, often occurring only as a casual. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Until about 1940 C. urbicum occurred frequently as a casual, mainly as a seed impurity, and populations persisted in some areas, such as at Ridge in Dorset where it was present for over fifty years. Since 1970 it has only occurred as a rare casual.|As an archaeophyte C. urbicum has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution.
Chenopodium vulvaria|A foetid, often prostrate annual of disturbed, nutrient-rich soil on sandy shingle beaches, sand dunes and coastal cliffs, where the soil is enriched by the droppings of sea-birds. It was formerly a ruderal of places enriched with animal dung. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|This species had declined dramatically before 1930, perhaps because of the change from horse to tractor power, and the declining use of dung as a fertiliser. By 1930 it was virtually confined to coastal habitats, and even here it has continued to decline for reasons which are unclear.|As an archaeophyte C. vulvaria has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside its native range.
Chrysanthemum segetum|A mainly spring-germinating annual of light, sandy or loamy soils deficient in calcium, found in arable fields and other disturbed habitats, on roadsides, waste ground and rubbish tips. 0-410 m (Eisteddfa Gurig, Cards.).|Archaeophyte|There is a continuous archaeological record of C. segetum in Britain from the Iron Age onwards. It was a serious weed in Victorian times, but is now much reduced due to improved seed cleaning, liming, herbicides and the shift to autumn-sown crops. Much of this decline has taken place since 1930.|As an archaeophyte C. segetum has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Chrysosplenium alternifolium|A perennial, stoloniferous herb found in boggy ground in woods, by streamsides, on wet rocks and mountain ledges, cliffs and gullies, usually in shade and usually with a supply of alkaline water. It is also found in montane, bryophyte-dominated flushes. 0-915 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|This species is much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas. The decline in East Anglia and the English S.W. Midlands had taken place before 1930.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Chrysosplenium oppositifolium|A perennial, stoloniferous herb found in boggy ground and seepages in woods, on streamsides, wet rocks and mountain ledges, usually in shade; also in grikes and sink-holes in limestone in the N. Pennines. It is generally found in more acidic habitats than C. alternifolium, but the two are often found together. 0-1100 m (Ben Nevis, Westerness).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of C. oppositifolium since the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Cicendia filiformis|An annual of open heathland habitats, growing on sandy and peaty soils of relatively high base-status which are damp in winter and spring; it is also found in damp pasture, woodland rides, dune-slacks and on cliffs. Reduced competition, caused by winter-flooding, grazing and disturbance, is essential. Lowland.|Native|The 1962 Atlas showed major losses before 1930, especially in Cornwall, and this species has declined further in areas such as Dorset. It is threatened at many sites because of the lack of grazing and the upgrading of heathland tracks with hardcore. In west Britain and Ireland, however, local losses may have been balanced by newly discovered sites.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.
Cicerbita alpina|A tall perennial of ledges inaccessible to grazing animals on moist, predominantly N.-facing acidic rocks, often where there is late snow-lie. From 700 m in Glen Doll (Angus) to 1090 m on Lochnagar (S. Aberdeen), but formerly at 530 m in Glen Canness (Angus).|Native|This is one of our rarest mountain plants and only four sites are extant. The perennial threat is from trampling or grazing by deer and other animals. It is an outbreeding species with several colonies perhaps comprising single clones with poor seed production.|European Boreal-montane element; a woodland and sub-montane meadow species across much of its European range.     © Pete Stroh
Cicerbita macrophylla|A tall perennial herb which has escaped from gardens and become established on roadsides, pond margins and river banks where, with its long rhizomes, it forms large clonal patches. Generally lowland, but reaching 320 m at Tomintoul (Banffs.).|Neophyte|This species was introduced into British gardens in 1823, and was first recorded as naturalised by a roadside at Glenridding, Ullswater (Cumberland) in 1915. It is still spreading in Britain and Ireland.|Our plant is subsp. uralensis, from the Urals; subsp. macrophylla is found in the Caucasus.
Cichorium intybus|A perennial herb of roadsides, field margins and rough grassland on a wide range of soils. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Though C. intybus was formerly regarded as a native, at least in England and Wales, doubt is now cast on that status by most modern local Floras, which suggest it is always a relic of its former cultivation as a fodder crop. This species has declined as it is now rarely cultivated.|As an archaeophyte C. intybus has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Cicuta virosa|This perennial herb grows in shallow water on the margins of standing or slowly flowing water, including lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, ditches and canals, or in deeper water on floating mats of vegetation. It also occurs in tall-herb fen, in marshy pasture and on damp mud. Lowland.|Native|Many losses of C. virosa are probably due to drainage, but it may have been eradicated from some pastures because of its toxicity to cattle. Some losses were very early: the last record in Cambridgeshire, for example, was made in the 18th century. However, the distribution now seems largely stable.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Circaea alpina|A perennial herb typically associated with seepage areas within rocky, bryophyte-rich Quercus woodland, but also found amongst boulders and scree by the sides of streams and waterfalls, under Pteridium, and even amongst Sphagnum. It probably spreads by rhizomes and stolons, as well as by seed. Generally lowland, but reaching 755 m on Knock Fell (Westmorland).|Native|C. alpina was formerly confused with C. x intermedia, and its status and distribution were not clarified until 1963. The overall distribution is probably stable.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Circaea alpina x lutetiana (C. x intermedia)|A perennial herb occurring in moist wooded or shaded habitats, by streams and amongst wet rocks; also sometimes in gardens and on disturbed roadsides. It spreads by rhizomes, stolons and occasionally by seed, even though it is usually sterile. It can persist in the absence of one or both parents. Generally lowland, but reaching 560 m at Allt Creagach, Coignafearn (Easterness).|Native|This vigorous hybrid perhaps arose shortly after the last Glacial period when C. alpina was more frequent. The map of C. alpina agg. in the 1962 Atlas is equivalent to C. x intermedia here. The hybrid has apparently increased since then, probably owing to better recording.|Widespread in temperate Europe; also C. & E. Asia and N. America.
Circaea lutetiana|A perennial herb found in moist, usually base-rich, shaded habitats, including both ancient and secondary woodland, hedgerows, scrub, stream and river banks, and as a weed of cultivation. Its spread is aided by its long, brittle but very persistent rhizomes. Generally lowland, but reaching 465 m at Highfolds Scar (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the overall range of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia and N. America.
Cirsium acaule|A rosette-forming perennial herb of short swards on base-rich soils, particularly on chalk and limestone. The northerly and westerly limits appear to be determined by summer warmth and in areas such as the Yorkshire Wolds and Derbyshire it is almost wholly confined to S.W.-facing slopes. It benefits from the sward being grazed to less than 10-15 cm, or frequent mowing, but is destroyed by heavy trampling. Generally lowland, but reaching 425 m at Trefil (Mons.).|Native|C. acaule shows very little change since the 1962 Atlas, other than in S.E. England where there have been losses, probably due to habitat loss.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Cirsium arvense|A perennial herb of over-grazed pastures, hay meadows and rough grassy places, roadsides, arable fields and other cultivated land, and in urban habitats and waste ground. Plants regenerate freely from rhizome fragments which are broken up by ploughing or other disturbance. 0-700 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth), and at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|Though listed as a noxious weed in Britain under the 1959 Weeds Act, there has been no change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas and probably little over many decades before that.|Eurasian Temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.
Cirsium dissectum|A shortly stoloniferous perennial herb of fens, fen-meadows, flood-pastures, bog margins and poorly-drained meadows on acid to neutral, usually peaty, soils. It often grows in sites subject to marked vertical or lateral movement of water. 0?500 m (Co. Sligo).|Native|C. dissectum has been lost from many localities in S. and E. England since the 1962 Atlas, following drainage or shading as its sites undergo succession to scrub or woodland. It is now much better recorded elsewhere. The contrast between the distribution of this species in Britain and Ireland, and between this species and C. heterophyllum, are unresolved biogeographical problems.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Cirsium eriophorum|A robust monocarpic perennial herb occurring in dry, often ungrazed, grasslands, open scrub and woods on limestone, chalk and lime-rich clay. It also grows in disturbed habitats created by quarrying. 0-310 m (Hassop Mines, Derbys.).|Native|There has been little overall change in the distribution of C. eriophorum since the 1962 Atlas. It has declined in some areas on the edges of its range, particularly in East Anglia where populations may have been only casual.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Cirsium heterophyllum|A perennial herb of stream banks, hay meadows, damp roadside verges and moist woodland margins. Mostly upland, reaching 760 m in the Breadalbanes (Mid Perth) and possibly to c. 975 m elsewhere in Scotland.|Native|C. heterophyllum is declining in some areas due to the shift from traditionally managed hay meadows to silage making, and as a result of unsympathetic management of roadside verges. Its restriction to a few localities in northern Ireland is characteristic of several other species in the Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element in our flora.|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Cirsium palustre|A monocarpic perennial herb of mires, fens, marshes, damp grassland, rush-pastures, wet woodland, montane springs and flushes, and tall-herb vegetation on mountain ledges. It reproduces by seed, which may persist for many years, as, for example, during the dark phase of a coppice cycle. 0-760 m (Cross Fell, Cumberland), and 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|There has been no overall change in the distribution of C. palustre since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Cirsium tuberosum|A perennial herb of old chalk and limestone grassland, often on slopes with a N. or N.W. aspect, and sometimes occurring in rank swards. It spreads by producing axillary basal rosettes to form clonal patches, and also reproduces by seed. Lowland.|Native|This species is declining in its two main areas in Wiltshire and Glamorgan. The reasons for the decline include habitat destruction by ploughing, coastal erosion, changes in land management and, particularly in Wiltshire, hybridisation with Cirsium acaule. It became extinct as a native in its sole Cambridgeshire locality in 1973, but has subsequently been re-introduced there.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Cirsium vulgare|A monocarpic perennial occurring in a wide array of habitats, including overgrazed pastures and rough grassland, sea-cliffs, dunes, drift lines and well-drained, fertile, disturbed habitats including arable fields, spoil heaps, waste ground and burnt areas in woodland. 0-685 (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth), and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|Though statutorily listed as a noxious weed in Britain and subject to control by landowners, there has been no change in the overall range since the 1962 Atlas, and it is probably increasing in man-made habitats.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Cladium mariscus|A rhizomatous perennial of oligotrophic to mesotrophic habitats, usually growing on peat. It is found in swamps at the margins of lakes and ponds and along streams, and in tall-herb fens and open fen carr. In England and Wales it is largely restricted to calcareous sites, whereas in the Hebrides and W. Ireland it also occurs in acidic areas. Lowland.|Native|C. mariscus has declined because of drainage, and some lowland sites are currently threatened by eutrophication and scrub invasion. However, it was under-recorded in Scotland in the 1962 Atlas, and new sites may await discovery there.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; also in N. America.     © P. Shannon
Claytonia perfoliata|An annual of open, sandy, disturbed ground, occurring as a weed in farmland and in gardens, and also under light shade, such as Breckland pine-belts. It is absent from wet and ill-drained soils and from limestone. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. perfoliata was introduced into cultivation in 1794. It was first recorded in the wild in 1849 and by 1853 was the most troublesome weed in the Chelsea Physic Garden (Kent, 1975). However, it was still relatively uncommon up to 1930. Since then it has spread significantly, and still seems to be increasing.|Native of western N. America; widely naturalised in N.W. Europe.
Claytonia sibirica|An annual to perennial herb of damp, bare sites, often found in open woodlands or hedgerows, or by shaded streams from where it may be washed downstream to new sites. Predominately lowland, but reaching 425 m at Dockray (Cumberland).|Neophyte|C. sibirica was cultivated in Britain by 1768 and was first noted in the wild in 1838. It has spread rapidly since 1930; in Cornwall, for example, it was not recorded until the 1930s but is now known in almost every 10-km square. It can quickly colonise woodland, suppressing other vegetation by its lush mass of spring foliage which then flops over nearby plants.|Native of eastern Asia and western N. America; widely naturalised in N.W. Europe.     © L. Rooney
Clematis vitalba|A climbing perennial with liana-like woody stems, often covering large areas on hedge banks, hedges and walls, trees and scrub, sand dunes, disused quarry faces and ruins. It is a classic railway plant. On base-rich soils, or utilising lime mortar, the plant can form virtual monocultures. The familiar feathered propagules, `Old Man`s Beard`, disperse readily, and often colonise new cuttings or banks. 0-305 m (N. of Matlock, Derbys.).|Native|Comparison of the current map with the 1962 Atlas suggests that the distribution of C. vitalba is stable.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Clinopodium acinos|A usually annual herb of open habitats in dry grassland, rocky ground or arable fields. In Britain it usually grows on calcareous soils, whereas in Ireland it occurs on sandy and gravelly sites, including eskers. It is also a rare casual of waste ground, quarries and banks by roads and railways. Lowland.|Native|C. acinos has substantially declined as a result of more efficient methods of weed control and, in Ireland, gravel extraction. In many areas it is no longer found in arable fields, surviving only in less intensively managed habitats. It is considered to be alien in Ireland (Scannell & Synnott, 1987).|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.     © P. Shannon
Clinopodium ascendens|A rhizomatous perennial of hedge banks, road verges, rough scrubby grassland and rocky outcrops, usually on dry calcareous soils. It may occur as a relic of cultivation. Generally lowland, but reaching 380 m at Conistone (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|Some sites for C. ascendens were lost before 1930, particularly in the north of its range. There have been further losses since the 1962 Atlas, the reasons for which include the lack of scrub control in its grassland habitats, and changes in road verge management. However, it is now much better recorded in some areas, particularly East Anglia and Somerset.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Clinopodium calamintha|A short-lived perennial herb of dry, S.-facing banks and rough grassland on calcareous, sandy or gravelly soils. Formerly a pasture plant, it is now largely confined to roadsides, railway banks, churchyards and waste ground. Lowland.|Native|The native range of C. calamintha is uncertain because of former confusion with C. ascendens and the occurrence of garden escapes. Despite these uncertainties it is clear that its range has contracted, and many colonies have been lost following habitat destruction and changes in cutting regimes in its grassland habitats.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.
Clinopodium menthifolium|A rhizomatous perennial herb of lightly-shaded woodland edges and scrub overlying chalk. Lowland.|Native|This species has been known since 1843 from a single dry chalk valley in the Isle of Wight. Although once abundant, the cessation of coppicing in the 1940s led to a marked decline, but this has been stemmed by the resumption of coppicing and the clearance of invasive ground-cover and more nutrient demanding tall herbs such as Eupatorium cannabinum and Urtica dioica.|European Temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Clinopodium vulgare|A rhizomatous perennial herb of hedges, woodland margins, coarse scrubby grassland, coastal cliffs and sand dunes, typically on dry calcareous soils. It is also found on waste ground, old quarries, and railway-sides. 0-395 m (W. Perth).|Native|There is no evidence of a change in the distribution of C. vulgare in S. England since the 1962 Atlas (where it was mapped as `all records`), although it is apparently decreasing in the northern half of its British range. Its decline in Cumbria has been noted by Halliday (1997).|Circumpolar Temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Cochlearia anglica|A biennial to perennial herb found in saltmarshes on soft, silty substrates, and in firmer areas of mud (and on sea-walls) near the high water mark of estuaries and tidal rivers. Unlike C. officinalis and C. danica, it is not found by roads. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of C. anglica appears to be stable. Scottish records in the 1962 Atlas from north of the Forth-Clyde line have all been referred to the C. officinalis aggregate. Some plants from N.W. England appear to be intermediate between C. anglica and C. officinalis (Halliday, 1997).|Oceanic Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Cochlearia atlantica||||
Cochlearia danica|A winter-annual of cliff-tops, sand dunes and sea-walls, and on old walls and pavements in coastal towns; generally preferring open ground on well-drained sandy soils or bare rock. It used to occur on railway ballast, and is now frequent along inland roadsides. Lowland, but above 300 m on roadsides in N. England.|Native|Since the early 1980s, C. danica has spread rapidly along salt-treated roads in Britain and N. Ireland, but not in S. Ireland where grit is used. A former preference for the central reservations of motorways and dual carriageways is becoming less obvious, and it now occurs on many single-carriageway A roads in England and Wales.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Cochlearia micacea|A perennial herb of micaceous soils, growing mainly in flushes, by springs and on streamsides, but also found on ledges, cliffs and in ravines. Upland, from 600 m on Meall nan Tarmachan (Mid Perth) to 1155 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|This species was described by E.S. Marshall in 1894 and the records were recently revised by Dalby & Rich (1995). It is almost certainly still under-recorded, and there is no reason to believe that its distribution is other than stable.|Endemic.
Cochlearia officinalis||||
Cochlearia officinalis sens.lat.|Biennial or perennial herbs found in a range of moist, open, coastal and montane habitats. They also grow on hedge banks, for example in S.W. England and Wales, but are only occasional recent colonists of salted roadsides. 0?1155 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|This aggregate (which includes species 3?5 in Stace, 1997), comprises cytologically, genetically and phenotypically variable taxa which probably hybridise freely. The taxonomic treatments of Stace (1991, 1997) and Rich (1991) are significantly different, and many recorders have only recorded the aggregate. The distribution is stable, other than in East Anglia where there is evidence of a decline.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element.
Cochlearia pyrenaica|A biennial or perennial herb of damp, open habitats, including montane cliffs, wet gullies, bryophyte-dominated flushes and spoil heaps by old lead and zinc mines. Subsp. pyrenaica is usually found on more basic soils than subsp. alpina. Generally upland, reaching 960 m on Carnedd Llewelyn (Caerns.) and perhaps higher in Scotland.|Native|The diploid subsp. pyrenaica is only known from N. England and Skye; the tetraploid subsp. alpina is more widespread. The latter is sometimes considered as a subspecies of C. officinalis. Because of the varying taxonomic treatments in recent years, C. pyrenaica is under-recorded, especially in Scotland.|European Arctic-montane element, but absent from the Boreal zonobiome.
Coeloglossum viride|A tuberous perennial herb restricted in S. Britain to dry, well-grazed, base-rich grassland such as chalk downland and dunes, and in chalk-pits. Elsewhere it grows in a wider range of calcareous grasslands, flushes, limestone pavement, scree, rocky ledges, roadsides and quarries. 0-915 m (Glen Doll, Angus).|Native|C. viride has declined considerably, particularly in C. England and East Anglia. Many losses occurred before 1930, but have continued since then, and are largely due to the ploughing and improvement of pastures. Molecular evidence suggests that this species should be included within Dactylorhiza (Bateman et al., 1997).|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.     © K. Marston, IWNHAS
Coincya monensis||||
Coincya wrightii|A perennial, occasionally biennial, herb, mainly found in open communities on S.-facing cliffs. It will grow on flat ground on the tops of cliffs, but only where protected from grazing animals and shielded from invading shrubs. Recent evidence suggests that seed can be dispersed in sea water. Lowland.|Native|C. wrightii was originally described from Lundy in 1936. It is holding its own there, but is dependent both on low levels of stocking and on the control of scrub.|Endemic.
Colchicum autumnale|A cormous perennial herb of damp grassy places, including damp meadows and river banks, but most frequently encountered in clearings and rides within woodland, as it is toxic to livestock and often destroyed when found in grazed situations. Lowland.|Native|C. autumnale had been lost from most of its outlying sites before 1930 because of loss of habitat. Further losses have occurred since then, especially from meadows, but it remains frequent within its core area. This showy flower is popular in gardens, and readily becomes naturalised when planted or discarded into suitable habitats.|European Temperate element.
Colutea arborescens|A deciduous shrub now well-established in waste places and rubbish tips, and particularly in rough grassland and scrub on railway banks. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was introduced into Britain by 1568, but has only become naturalised extensively since 1900, spreading initially along railways but then becoming more widespread.|Native of S. Europe.
Conium maculatum|A biennial of damp places, such as ditches and river banks, and of drier habitats, including rough grassland, waste ground, rubbish tips and roadsides. It is a colonist of disturbed areas, particularly on dredged mud, sometimes forming large stands. Generally lowland, but reaching 305 m at Llynheillyn (Rads.).|Archaeophyte|The distribution of C. maculatum is little changed since the 1962 Atlas, although the map suggests declines on the edges of its range. Conversely, local increases in its core areas have been reported, particularly in open habitats (Killick et al., 1998).|As an archaeophyte C. maculatum has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Conopodium majus|A perennial herb, found in damp or shaded meadows and pastures, hedgerows, roadside verges, copses and woodlands; especially characteristic of some types of northern hay meadow (Rodwell, 1992). It grows on a wide range of acidic and base-rich soils. 0-700 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth), and 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|C. majus has declined locally as its grassland habitats have been improved (Brewis et al., 1996), but its national distribution at a 10-km scale is little changed. It was introduced in Shetland in the 19th century, but its status in Orkney is unclear.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Consolida ajacis|An annual species found on waste ground, rubbish tips and in cultivated fields. As an arable weed it usually occurs on dry soils in chalky or sandy areas. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. ajacis was being grown in British gardens by 1573 and was first recorded from the wild in 1650. It is a casual, formerly introduced as a contaminant of imported grain but now much more frequent as a garden escape. Some older records may be misidentifications of C. orientalis or C. regalis, which were often confused with it but which are not commonly grown in gardens.|Apparently native of S. Europe and S.W. Asia, but its native range is obscured by its occurrence as a naturalised and casual alien.     © L. Rooney
Convallaria majalis|A rhizomatous perennial herb of freely-draining, nutrient-poor soils. It is most frequent in Fraxinus woods on limestone in N. and W. Britain, but also grows in the grikes of limestone pavement, in acidic woods in S.E. England, and in a fen in Cumbria. It is a common garden escape. 0-470 m (Carreg-goch, Brecs.).|Native|The native distribution of C. majalis is probably stable, but is now very largely obscured by naturalised plants. It is often difficult to separate native and alien plants and the map must be regarded as an approximation. Many of the losses had occurred by 1930.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in E. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Convolvulus arvensis|A trailing or climbing perennial herb, found on waste or cultivated ground, waysides, railway banks, open scrub and rough or short grassland, including disturbed chalk downland. Lowland.|Native|C. arvensis, which was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, shows local losses in the north and west of its range.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.
Conyza canadensis|An erect annual of well-drained, open habitats such as pavements, waste places, walls, railway ballast and as a weed of cultivated ground. It is particularly characteristic of urban areas of S. and E. England. It also occurs occasionally on sand dunes and on sandy ground inland. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species has been known in the London area since 1690. It has shown a marked expansion of range in Britain since the 1962 Atlas, and was first recorded in Ireland in 1983.|Native of N. America; naturalised throughout Europe and in similar climatic regions almost worldwide.
Conyza sumatrensis|A tall and very conspicuous annual of well-drained, open and disturbed ground, such as waste land, railway-sides and docks, chiefly around towns. It also occurs as a wool casual. Lowland.|Neophyte|The first record for C. sumatrensis in our area was from Guernsey in 1961. It was found naturalised in S. Essex in 1974 and was well established in the London area by 1984. It appears to be spreading rapidly, and was first recorded in Ireland in 1990.|Native of S. America; widely naturalised in Europe.
Corallorhiza trifida|A saprophytic herb usually found in shaded, damp, Alnus and Salix carr on raised mires and lake margins, but which also occurs in dune-slacks with Salix repens. More rarely, it grows in tall-herb fen, in Betula and Pinus woods (amongst Sphagnum) and on moorland. It may colonise secondary habitats, including plantations and quarries. 0-365 m (Braemar, S. Aberdeen).|Native|C. trifida is easily overlooked and new sites are still being found; it is much better recorded now than in the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Coriandrum sativum|An annual, usually occurring as a casual on rubbish tips or disturbed ground, mostly from bird-seed and culinary sources; also established in a few places, such as on roadsides in N.W. Essex. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. sativum was grown in Britain by 995 (Harvey, 1981). Although increasingly cultivated as a culinary herb, its distribution in the wild is limited by the fact that young plants are very frost-tender. It was first recorded from the wild in 1793.|Apparently native of N. Africa and W. Asia; widely naturalised in S. Europe and elsewhere.
Cornus sanguinea|A deciduous shrub, locally frequent in woodland, scrub, hedgerows and shelter-belts on limestone soils or base-rich clays, and sometimes dominant in hedges and scrub on chalk. It is frequently planted in landscaping schemes and is introduced sporadically, or occurs as an escape, outside its native range. Lowland.|Native|There has been no significant change in the distribution of C. sanguinea since the 1962 Atlas, but introductions have begun to blur its native range. In Ireland the native range follows Scannell & Synnott (1987), but more work is needed to clarify the situation there.|European Temperate element.
Cornus sericea|A deciduous shrub naturalised in woodland and along riversides, sometimes suckering to produce extensive thickets; also much planted in parkland, amenity plantings and on roadsides and sometimes occurs as an escape on waste ground and marginal land. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. sericea was cultivated in Britain by 1683. It was known from the wild by at least 1905 and is now well-naturalised in many places. It is probably increasing.|Native of N. America; closely related to the Eurasian C. alba.
Cornus suecica|A low-growing rhizomatous perennial herb of wet, base-poor peats at moderate to high altitudes, including areas of late snow-lie. It is almost entirely confined to montane dwarf shrub heath communities, but also extends into acid montane grassland. From 135 m in N.W. Yorkshire to 915 m in Atholl (E. Perth).|Native|The distribution is very similar to that in the 1962 Atlas, and it is probably still present in remote 10-km squares for which only pre-1987 records are available. It was last seen, however, at its most southerly native locality, Turton Moor (S. Lancs.), in 1977.|European Boreo-arctic Montane element, but absent from mountains of C. Europe; also in E. Asia and N. America.     © Pete Stroh
Coronopus didymus|An annual or biennial herb of damp, often winter-wet soils, occurring on cultivated and waste ground, and frequently found in gardens and lawns, by paths and roadsides and on rubbish tips. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. didymus reached Britain in the early 18th century, being recorded from the wild by 1778. It is now frequent in urban and industrial areas, and is still spreading into rural areas where it is widespread but scattered.|A widespread alien in W. Europe, N. America and the S. hemisphere; origin uncertain, often cited as S. America.
Coronopus squamatus|A spring-germinating annual, rarely biennial, herb of nutrient-rich, often compacted soils in open, dry or winter-wet habitats. Typical sites include farmyards, waste ground, paths and particularly gateways. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|The distribution of C. squamatus is stable.|As an archaeophyte C. squamatus has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Corrigiola litoralis|This annual is now confined, as a native plant, to periodically inundated, open, muddy shingle around the margins of Slapton Ley (S. Devon). It formerly grew in a similar site at Loe Pool (W. Cornwall), and casual plants have been recorded elsewhere, from railway ballast and waste ground. Lowland.|Native|At Slapton Ley, populations have declined in recent years, partly due to reduced trampling by cattle, but current conservation management aimed at maintaining open conditions should ensure its survival there. The Loe Pool population was lost because of stabilisation of water levels and invasion by Phragmites australis.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Corylus avellana|A deciduous suckering shrub of dry or damp, calcareous to mildly acidic soils, but favouring moist, base-rich conditions. It is native in the understorey of many woods, in scrub, hedgerows, on river banks, limestone pavement, cliffs and gullies, but it is also widely planted in copses and hedgerows. 0-640 m (Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|There is little evidence for a change in the distribution of this species; the increase in Scottish records is due to better recording. High numbers of livestock, deer and squirrels can limit regeneration, and conifer planting and the cessation of woodland management may reduce abundance locally.|European Temperate element.
Corynephorus canescens|A perennial herb growing in open areas on consolidated dunes, on sandy shingle and on open sand. It also occurs on dunes and sandy heathland on acidic soils inland. It requires mobile sand for its survival; mature tufts are reinvigorated by partial burial. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of C. canescens is now probably stable, following losses before 1930. Its status is uncertain in some areas. In Lancashire, Savidge et al. (1963) regard it as native but Sell & Murrell (1996) treat it as probably introduced. In Scotland, Trist (1998) describes it as alien, but Ryves et al. (1996) suggest that its recent arrival may be an expansion of its natural range.|European Southern-temperate element.
Cotoneaster bullatus|A large deciduous shrub, found naturalised in woodland, scrub, hedgerows and quarries, and on railway banks, roadsides, sand dunes, cliffs, walls and waste ground. Reproduction is by seed, which is frequently bird-sown. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. bullatus was introduced into cultivation in 1898, and is now widely planted in gardens and in roadside amenity schemes. It was known from the wild in Britain by at least 1957 (S. Lancs.), and is probably increasing, but it may have been over-recorded for C. rehderi.|Native of W. China.
Cotoneaster cambricus|"A spreading apomictic deciduous shrub confined to limestone rocks and ledges on the Great Orme (Caerns.). The few plants which remain from a larger population do not appear to regenerate either by seed or vegetatively. Lowland.
 



      Trends    

Neophyte. Although described by Fryer & Hylmö (1994) as a native endemic species, Kay & John (1995) consider it to be more likely of garden origin and have cast doubt on its distinction from C. integerrimus, a species which was in cultivation by 1656. It has declined since its discovery in about 1825 due to poor fruiting, grazing and scrub encroachment.
 



      World Distribution    

A member of the C. integerrimus complex, which has a European Boreal-montane distribution but occurs as a garden escape outside its native range.

Cotoneaster horizontalis|A deciduous arching or prostrate shrub, found in rocky grassland and on railway banks, cliffs, limestone pavement, quarries, chalk pits, pavements and walls. It occurs as a garden escape or throw-out, and is also frequently bird-sown. It reproduces readily from seed and is usually very well-naturalised, sometimes even posing a threat to native vegetation. Lowland.|Neophyte|C. horizontalis was introduced into cultivation around 1879 and is extremely popular in gardens. It was first recorded from the wild in 1940. It appears to be increasing rapidly.|Native of W. China.
Cotoneaster integrifolius||||
Cotoneaster microphyllus agg.|These evergreen shrubs form carpeting mounds in rocky grassland and quarries, and on roadsides, railway banks, cliffs, scree, walls and pavements. They are often well-naturalised, especially on well-drained, calcareous substrates. Lowland.|Neophyte|The twelve species in this aggregate (species 21?32, Stace, 1997), are difficult to identify. They have been cultivated since at least 1824, and one (C. integrifolius) was recorded in the wild in 1892, at a site in N. Somerset where it still occurs. The vast majority of records are of C. integrifolius, and the map of this species in the 1962 Atlas is equivalent to this aggregate. It has increased since then, and is better recorded.|The species in this aggregate are natives of N. India, the Himalayas and China.
Cotoneaster simonsii|An erect, deciduous shrub, found in woodland, hedgerows, rocky grassland and scrub and on heathland, rock outcrops, walls, pavements, quarries and waste ground. It is frequently naturalised, and often originates from bird-sown seed. Generally lowland, but reaching 335 m near Watermillock (Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species, introduced from the Himalayas in 1865, is very popular in gardens and in amenity planting schemes. It was first recorded in the wild in 1910. Its distribution has increased considerably since it was mapped in the 1962 Atlas, due to both better recording and a genuine spread.|Native of the Himalayas.
Crambe maritima|A long-lived perennial herb of shingle and boulder beaches, very occasionally found on dunes (but only where these overlay shingle) and on cliffs. It reproduces by seed and from detached pieces of root. Lowland.|Native|C. maritima has declined in parts of its British range, probably because of sea-defence works which have destroyed its shingle habitats. On the other hand it has increased elsewhere, perhaps because it is now rarely gathered as a vegetable and its habitats are usually ungrazed. It has also increased in Ireland since the 1960s.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Crassula aquatica|A small, slender annual which is currently known from only one locality. It grows in shallow water or on wet mud exposed by fluctuating water levels at the side of the River Shiel (Westerness), and on damp peaty soil where the riverside vegetation has been disturbed. The population is well-established but varies in size annually. Lowland.|Native|or alien. C. aquatica formerly occurred at Adel Dam (Mid-W.

It was discovered by the River Shiel in 1969.|Circumpolar Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe and a disjunct distribution elsewhere.
Crassula helmsii|This perennial herb grows submerged in sheltered waters up to 3 metres deep or as an emergent on damp ground. It grows on soft substrates in a variety of habitats, including ponds, lakes, reservoirs, canals and ditches and can tolerate a wide range of water chemistry. It can form dense, virtually pure stands. Lowland.|Neophyte|This aggressively colonising species was first cultivated in Britain in 1927 and was discovered in the wild in 1956 (Greensted, Essex). Since the late 1970s it has spread rapidly north and west, and was first recorded in Ireland in 1994 at Gosford Castle (Co. Armagh).|Native of Australia and New Zealand.
Crassula tillaea|A tiny annual, growing on bare, often compacted, sandy or gravelly ground. It is often found on rutted tracks, paths and other areas where the ground is kept open by disturbance and periodic flooding. It can withstand only minimal competition from other vegetation. Lowland.|Native|The British range of this species appears to be expanding. Since the 1962 Atlas it has become much more frequent in S.W. England and has colonised forestry rides in N.E. Scotland. In Cornwall, where it was not known until 1988, it is known from several car- and caravan-parks on sandy sites.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Crataegus laevigata|A shrub or small tree typically occurring in ancient woods, wood-borders, old hedgerows and boundary banks on clay soils. It appears to be more tolerant of shade than C. monogyna. Lowland.|Native|The frequency of C. laevigata has changed little in its core range since the 1962 Atlas, but there are now many scattered new records beyond that area. It is widely planted both inside and outside its core area, and most of the new records must relate to planted populations. C. laevigata is not always easy to distinguish from C. x media, and some records may be errors for the hybrid.|European Temperate element.
Crataegus monogyna|A deciduous shrub or tree of hedgerows, scrub and wood-borders, and as an understorey in open woodland on a wide range of soils. It can persist as scattered bushes in grazed sites, spreading rapidly when grazing declines or ceases. Its prolifically produced fruits are an important winter food for birds. 0-610 m (Melmerby High Scar, Cumberland).|Native|This species has been widely planted as a hedging plant for many centuries, and the limits of its native distribution are unclear. In N. Scotland it is often confined to the vicinity of habitation, and in some areas is certainly introduced. Its distribution is stable.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Crepis biennis|A stout, biennial herb of rough grassland and woodland margins on chalk soils in S.E. England, but elsewhere introduced, often with grass seed, and persisting locally in pastures, in arable fields and on field margins, roadsides, dry banks and waste ground. Lowland.|Native|Since the 1962 Atlas C. biennis has consolidated its native range, and spread as an alien elsewhere, especially in Ireland; it was first recorded in Shetland in 1999. In N. and W.

Crepis capillaris|This morphologically variable winter-green annual is an early colonist of open ground, found in thin grassland, on road verges, lawns, spoil heaps, rocky banks and other open habitats. It is a poor competitor in closed vegetation. 0-445 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Native|The distribution of C. capillaris appears to be stable, but it may be increasing locally in man-made habitats.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Crepis foetida|An annual or biennial herb now found only on disturbed coastal shingle, but formerly also in open sandy or chalky habitats inland. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|C. foetida is now only known as an established population from Dungeness (E. Kent). It became extinct there in 1980, but following its re-introduction in 1992 a new population has been established in a shingle-heath community. The reasons for its extinction are unclear, though biotic factors may have been significant as rabbits seem partial to it. The Dungeness plant is subsp. foetida; the rare casual records may be referable to the C. and S.E. European subsp. commutata or to subsp. rhoeadifolia.|As an archaeophyte C. foetida has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution.     © L. Rooney
Crepis mollis|A winter-green perennial of herb-rich grassland and wood-pasture on shallow base-rich soils. From 90 m beside the Swarland Burn (Cheviot) to 670 m in Caenlochan (Angus).|Native|This species has declined and is no longer present in many of its late 19th century localities. It has not been seen since 1986 in over half the 10-km squares for which there are post-1970 records, indicating a substantial decline in the last thirty years. Conversely, however, it was under-recorded in the past and has been discovered in new localities in N. England and S. Scotland since 1960.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Crepis paludosa|In the uplands, this perennial herb is found on rocky, wooded streamsides, where it often grows on water-splashed rocks, and also in sheltered gullies and flushed banks. At lower altitudes it occurs in fens, damp hay meadows, ditches and on roadside verges. Lowland to 915 m (Easterness).|Native|There has been no overall change in the distribution of C. paludosa since the 1962 Atlas, but it has declined at the southern edge of its range in both England and Ireland following habitat destruction and the drainage of lowland marshes.|European Boreo-temperate element.
Crepis praemorsa|A perennial herb, confined to low banks of limestone drift at the edges of a hay meadow and grazed pasture, at an altitude of 240 m (Westmorland).|Native|This species was found for the first time in Britain (and W. Europe) in Westmorland in 1988. In 1996, the population comprised about two hundred individuals. Doubt has been expressed about its status, and it is regarded as an archaeophyte in some European countries. However, the similarity of its British and Scandinavian habitats and the undisturbed nature of the site suggest that it may be native in Britain.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Crepis vesicaria|A usually biennial herb, sometimes annual or perennial, of lightly mown or grazed grassland on roadsides, lawns, railway banks and in waste places. Lowland.|Neophyte|In Britain, this species was first recorded in 1713 in Kent. It spread rapidly, reaching the west coast of Ireland in 1896. It is now the commonest yellow composite in flower on roadsides in S. Britain and S. Ireland in May. It has failed to spread far into N. England, and the first authentic record from Co. Durham was not made until 1951. There are many more records in W. England, Wales and Ireland than in the 1962 Atlas.|Native of the Mediterranean region and S.W. Asia.
Crithmum maritimum|A fleshy perennial herb of spray-drenched rock crevices and ledges on sea-cliffs, coastal rocks and on stabilised shingle; also in maritime grassland and artificial habitats like harbour walls and stone sea defences. It appears indifferent to soil reaction, being found on many rock types from chalk and limestone to granite. Lowland.|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of C. maritimum since the 1962 Atlas.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Crocosmia aurea x pottsii (C. x crocosmiiflora)|A cormous perennial herb spreading vegetatively by means of rhizomes to form dense clumps in woods and hedge banks, by roadsides and on waste ground. Although some viable seed is produced, most wild populations have probably arisen from discarded garden plants and subsequent vegetative spread. Generally lowland, but reaching 340 m N. of Carter Bar (Roxburghs.).|Neophyte|This hybrid, which is extremely common in gardens, was raised in France in 1880 and reached Britain the same year. It was first recorded from the wild in 1911; since the 1962 Atlas it has dramatically extended its range eastwards and considerably consolidated its distribution in W. Britain and Ireland.|A hybrid of garden origin between two S. African parents.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Cruciata laevipes|A perennial herb of deep, well-drained neutral or calcareous soils, typically occurring in ungrazed grassland, open scrub, hedge banks, woodland rides and edges, and on waysides. 0-550 m (Garrigill, Cumberland).|Native|C. laevipes has shown some losses since the 1962 Atlas. Although characteristic of older and relatively undisturbed habitats, it is able to colonise roadsides, river- and railway embankments, and remains fairly frequent across its range. It is considered alien in Ireland (Scannell & Synnott, 1987), where it remains rare.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Cryptogramma crispa|This small, deciduous, long-lived fern is a strong calcifuge and is found in well-drained sites on relatively stable, steep scree slopes, where it is a pioneer species. It also occurs on cliff ledges and mortar-free dry-stone walls. From 80 m (Glen Etive, Main Argyll) to 1280 m (Ben Nevis, Westerness).|Native|Losses in the S. Pennines took place before 1930, and there is little evidence for a change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|European Boreal-montane element; also in E. Asia.     © Pete Stroh
Cuscuta epithymum|An annual, rarely perennial, rootless twining herb, parasitic on the stems of a wide variety of small shrubs and herbs (most frequently Calluna vulgaris, Thymus polytrichus, Ulex gallii and U. minor) on heathland, chalk downland and fixed dune grasslands. It is also casual on field crops and in arable field-borders at the northern and western extent of its range. Lowland.|Native|The loss of lowland heath, ploughing of chalk downlands, and an increase in scrub have caused a decline in this species since 1930. Whilst it is still locally abundant, the map suggests a continuing substantial decline.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Cuscuta europaea|An annual, rarely perennial, rootless twining holoparasite of damp nitrophilous places, especially the banks of rivers, but also hedges and ditches. Its primary host is usually Urtica dioica, rarely Humulus lupulus or other species, whence it can spread to a wide spectrum of secondary hosts. It often grows close to flowing water, which may disperse the seeds. Lowland.|Native|C. europaea has been found in many new sites in the E. Midlands since 1970, presumably due to better recording. However, it appears to be in decline in some areas, though is probably still overlooked in others.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Cymbalaria muralis|This perennial herb is well-established on old walls and bridges, pavements, and in other well-drained rocky and stony places, often near habitation. It is also found as large, prostrate patches on shingle beaches. It can root from fragments or from nodes, and its seeds germinate readily in brick and stone mortar. 0-450 m (Garrigill, Cumberland).|Neophyte|C. muralis was introduced into gardens before 1602, and records from the wild date from 1640 (Herts.). Comparison of the current map with that in the 1962 Atlas suggests that its distribution is now stable.|Native of the mountains of S.C. & S.E. Europe; widely naturalised through much of temperate and southern Europe.
Cynodon dactylon|A mat-forming perennial herb, found on eroding fore-dunes in dry sandy places and short grassland by the sea, including lawns and sea-front promenades, and inland on lawns and roadside verges. It is also found around docks, on rubbish tips and as a casual from wool shoddy and other sources. Lowland.|Native|C. dactylon was first recorded in the wild in 1688. Although sometimes considered to be an alien in our area, it may be native on fore-dunes in W. Cornwall and possibly in the Channel Islands (Wigginton, 1999). There has been little change in its distribution over the last thirty to forty years.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element.
Cynoglossum germanicum|A biennial or short-lived perennial herb of glades in or margins of deciduous woodland, usually Fagus or Quercus; sometimes also occurring in hedge banks. It is found mainly on calcareous, freely-draining, loamy soils. Lowland.|Native|The marked decline of this species before 1930 was shown in the 1962 Atlas. The reasons for it are unclear, but it may be more apparent than real as many old records appear to have been of transient populations. Further sites have been lost since 1930, but the great storm of 1987 opened up its woodland habitats, and since then huge populations have been recorded in Surrey.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Cynoglossum officinale|A biennial herb of disturbed ground, growing mostly on dry, often base-rich soils. Habitats include coastal dunes, shingle, open grassland, woodland margins and clearings, field edges, cleared land and gravelly waste. It is unpalatable to grazing animals and is often frequent on disturbed ground by rabbit warrens. Generally lowland, but reaching 400 m on Eglwyseg Rocks, Llangollen (Denbs.).|Native|C. officinale has declined sharply since the 1950s, loss of habitat and herbicide spraying doubtless being major factors. Some old records in N. Scotland and Ireland are considered to be relics of cultivation by herbalists.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Cynosurus cristatus|A short-lived perennial herb growing in a wide variety of grasslands, particularly short and heavily grazed swards. It grows in a range of neutral to base-rich, fairly well-drained or damp soils, avoiding only the extremes of base-status, waterlogging, drought and disturbance. Generally lowland, but to 660 m on Burnhope Seat (Cumberland) and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|C. cristatus was a frequent constituent of seed mixtures until the 1940s, and is still used in amenity sowings and possibly in upland leys on poor soils. There has been no change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Cyperus fuscus|An annual of moist, open disturbed ground around the margins of ponds and by ditches, often on ground subject to winter-flooding. The substrate may be peaty, muddy or stony but humus-rich. Seed may not be set in cool summers. Lowland.|Native|The conditions favoured by C. fuscus were traditionally maintained by grazing animals, but cessation of grazing, encroachment by scrub and lowering of the water-tables have all contributed to an appreciable decline which began before 1930. However, current sites now benefit from statutory protection, and since seed appears to be long-lived, populations may be revived with suitable conservation management.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element.
Cyperus longus|A rhizomatous perennial herb of marshes and wet pastures near the coast, and sometimes in base-rich flushes on sea-cliffs. It also occurs on pond margins and in ditches inland, where it is usually planted. Reproduction is through vigorous rhizomatous spread, and it may not set seed in Britain. Lowland.|Native|Since the 1962 Atlas this species has apparently been lost from some native sites because of agricultural change, including the cessation of grazing. However, new native sites have been discovered since 1960, notably in N. Wales, and the number of introduced sites has increased very considerably.|European Southern-temperate element.
Cypripedium calceolus|A rhizomatous perennial herb found on well-drained calcareous soils derived from limestone, in herb-rich grassland or, formerly, in open woodland. Plants are long-lived but seed-set may be poor. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Native|This species suffered many losses due to collecting, mostly during the 19th century. The single native colony is heavily protected, although damage by rodents has been known. A recovery programme, including introduction of the species to new and former sites, is underway; details of these sites are not available.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Cystopteris dickieana|A fern of rock crevices, shady ravines, cave entrances and also under overhangs. It prefers moderately base-rich rocks. 0-380 m (above Loch Tay, Mid Perth).|Native|This species was originally described from the coast south of Aberdeen in 1848. It has recently been found in a few inland sites, and may be overlooked elsewhere. However, its taxonomic status `remains uncertain and controversial` (Dyer et al., 2000) and recent allozyme studies do not support its recognition as a species distinct from C. fragilis.|As the characters which define C. dickieana are unresolved, it is impossible to summarise its world distribution.
Cystopteris fragilis|A fern of damp, shaded rock crevices, cliffs, cave entrances, ravines and mortared walls, always growing on a mineral-enriched substrate, and most frequent over limestone. It is also found on field boundary banks where water seeps from improved pasture, and in Fraxinus woodland. 0-1220 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of C. fragilis in the uplands is stable. Some lowland sites, particularly those on old buildings, bridges, canal locks and railway platforms, have been lost since 1950 through demolition or cleaning.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element.
Cystopteris montana|A deciduous fern of sheltered, humid, N.- or E.-facing limestone and mica-schist cliffs where there is periodic irrigation. It prefers dripping rock ledges, cliff bases, gullies and steep, unstable scree slopes. From 490 m on Ben Lui (Main Argyll) to 1125 m on Aonach Beag (Westerness).|Native|Easily overlooked and sometimes growing in inaccessible sites, C. montana is probably present in most 10-km squares for which only pre-1987 records exist. It is susceptible to grazing, and had been lost from some sites before 1930 because of collecting.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Cytisus scoparius|C. scoparius subsp. scoparius is an erect shrub of sandy acidic soils, on heaths, open woodland, railway banks, stony riversides and, particularly, on roadside banks and verges where it may often be planted. The prostrate subsp. maritimus grows on western sea-cliffs. Generally lowland, but reaching 640 m in Atholl (E. Perth).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of C. scoparius since the 1962 Atlas. In N. Britain, entire populations may die back during very cold winters. Subsp. scoparius occurs throughout the range of the species; subsp. maritimus is mapped separately.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Daboecia cantabrica|This straggling, low shrub occurs on heathland and moorland, often on rocky terrain, usually with other shrubs including Calluna vulgaris, Erica cinerea and Ulex gallii. It grows in thin acidic soils over quartzites or mica-schists, avoiding peat. 0-580 m (Ben Lettery, W. Galway, and Maamtrasna, W. Mayo).|Native|The distribution of D. cantabrica is probably little changed, if at all, since 1950. It is naturalised in a few sites in Britain.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Dactylis glomerata|A tufted perennial herb of woods, meadows and pastures, downland and hill-slopes, maritime cliff grasslands, fixed dunes, field margins, roadsides and waste ground on a wide range of fertile, neutral and basic soils. 0-685 (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth) and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of D. glomerata since the 1962 Atlas. It is tolerant of grazing and is a common constituent of grass-seed mixtures for leys, with much seed coming from Denmark. It is often a relic of cultivation in the extreme north and west.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Dactylorhiza fuchsii|This tuberous perennial herb grows on neutral or base-rich soils in a wide range of habitats, including deciduous woodland, scrub, roadsides, chalk grassland, meadows, marshes, dune-slacks, fens and mildly acidic heaths. It can become abundant in artificial habitats such as waste ground, abandoned gravel-pits, quarries and railway embankments. 0?530 m (Garrigill, Cumberland).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, and losses have been balanced by its ability to colonise newly available, often man-made, habitats.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Dactylorhiza incarnata|A tuberous perennial herb growing on damp or wet calcareous soils, in meadows, marshes, ditches, fens, flushes and dune-slacks, and also on more acidic soils in bogs and damp heaths. 0-610 m (Atholl, E. Perth, and Caenlochan, Angus).|Native|D. incarnata was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined due to drainage and agricultural improvement, and is often the first Dactylorhiza to be lost when a habitat begins to dry out. Six subspecies are recognised; all are mapped separately except subsp. gemmana, which is of uncertain status and has been neglected by recorders.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Dactylorhiza lapponica|"A tuberous perennial herb of base-rich hill flushes associated with superficially acidic and peaty soils; sometimes also spreading into nearby areas of more acidic wet heath. Most sites are moderately or heavily grazed. 0–310 m (Knapdale, Westerness).
 



      Trends    

Native. This taxon, first discovered in Britain in 1967, is almost certainly still under-recorded. Populations tend to be small but are apparently stable, despite annual fluctuations in numbers. It may have been over-looked as D. traunsteineri in N. Ireland; D. lapponica may best be treated as a subspecies or variety of D. traunsteineri.

Dactylorhiza maculata|This tuberous perennial herb is found on a range of well-drained or wet acidic soils in a wide variety of habitats, including grasslands, moors, heaths, flushes and bogs. It also occurs in pockets of peat on limestone and, more rarely, in open woodland. 0?915 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|This species has declined, particularly in lowland heaths and bogs, through habitat destruction and drainage. Cessation of grazing on heaths, causing reversion to woodland, also accounts for some losses. It can still be very abundant, however, in suitable habitats.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Dactylorhiza majalis|A tuberous perennial herb of damp, calcareous soils, growing in fens, marshes, wet meadows and dune-slacks. Lowland.|Native|This species has been much better recorded since the 1962 Atlas, particularly in Ireland. Its overall distribution is stable, but its taxonomy is not. Stace (1997) assigned plants in Ireland and North Uist to subsp. occidentalis and all others to subsp. cambrensis; recent work indicates that this last is better treated as a subspecies of D. purpurella, that subsp. occidentalis should be raised to specific rank, and that the North Uist plants are probably referable to D. traunsteineri (R. M. Bateman, in litt.).|European Temperate element.
Dactylorhiza praetermissa|A tuberous perennial herb of calcareous marshes, fens, damp meadows, roadsides and dune-slacks, and also less acidic bogs and wet heathland. It avoids areas that are inundated for long periods, and is rarely found in drier sites such as chalk downland. It also colonises artificial habitats such as quarries and industrial waste ground. Lowland.|Native|This species is much better recorded now than in the 1962 Atlas, especially in the English Midlands. Although there have been local losses to drainage and habitat destruction, mostly since 1930, it is still frequent in suitable habitats in many areas and may have increased in man-made habitats.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Dactylorhiza purpurella|A tuberous perennial herb of neutral to base-rich soils, occurring in dune-slacks, fens, marshes, wet meadows, flushes, ditches and on roadside verges. It is also frequent in old quarries and urban waste land, where it can colonise drier sites such as rubble, and it occasionally grows in neglected gardens. 0-610 m (Creag Dhuba, Loch Ericht, Westerness).|Native|The overall distribution of D. purpurella is stable in Britain, although there have been local losses due to habitat destruction and drainage. In Ireland, however, it appears to have declined, especially in the south. It is sometimes confused with D. majalis.|Oceanic Boreal-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Dactylorhiza traunsteineri|A tuberous perennial herb of damp, base-rich habitats such as marshes, water-meadows, flushes and fens. It sometimes prefers more open flushed or very wet areas with reduced competition. Lowland.|Native|This species is much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas, especially in Scotland, and the overall distribution appears to be stable. There have been losses, however, mainly due to disturbance and lowering of water-tables. It may be under-recorded in some areas, especially Ireland.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Damasonium alisma|This annual grows on acidic mud by small ponds where the habitat is kept open by fluctuating water levels and disturbance by grazing animals. Its sites are usually flooded in winter but may be wet or dry in summer. The seeds appear to persist in a long-lived seed bank. Lowland.|Native|D. alisma declined catastrophically in the 19th and early 20th centuries following the decline of traditional grazing regimes. Most sites have become filled in, overgrown or reduced to suburban duck-ponds. Only one site was known in the 1980s, but the species has since responded to conservation management at some sites and has been planted at others.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Danthonia decumbens|A densely tufted perennial herb of pastures, heathy grassland and moorland, favouring mildly acidic soils. It is also found in calcareous swards, including chalk and limestone grassland, but is then rooted into more acidic, superficial or leached horizons. It is frequent too in damp montane grassland. It spreads by seed and seems to have a persistent seed bank. 0-595 m (Tal-y-fan, Caerns.) and possibly at 1040 m on Macgillycuddy`s Reeks (S. Kerry).|Native|D. decumbens, mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, has declined in many areas of England and Ireland since 1950, presumably with the loss of permanent pastures.|European Temperate element.
Daphne laureola|An evergreen, low-growing shrub of heavy, neutral to basic soils in deciduous woodland, often in quite deep shade. It reproduces by self-layering and by seed, but as it flowers in the early spring and requires cross-pollination by flies or moths, seed-set is often poor. Lowland.|Native|D. laureola is usually regarded as a native in England and Wales, but it is also a relic of cultivation or introduction in many sites, and across much of its British range is more typical of pheasant-rearing estates and parklands than semi-natural woodland. Many squares mapped as native are more likely to be alien.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.
Daphne mezereum|A deciduous shrub of calcareous woodland, often on steep, sometimes rocky, slopes with little ground cover, but rarely in deep shade. It also grows in chalk-pits, and in wet, species-rich fens. It reproduces by seed and is self-fertile. 0-335 m (Ling Gill, Ribblesdale, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|D. mezereum was not recorded in the wild until 1752. It has been cultivated for centuries and escapes are common, so its native range is somewhat uncertain. Native populations have suffered from habitat loss and uprooting, but it is common in gardens, is frequently bird-sown, and is increasing as an alien.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Datura stramonium|An annual of waste ground, rubbish tips, cultivated and disturbed ground. Most populations are casual, but the species can become naturalised, or reappear after long periods from dormant seeds. It most frequently arises as a garden escape or from bird-seed, but also from oil-seed and grain. Lowland.|Neophyte|D. stramonium was cultivated in Britain by 1597 and was grown commercially for alkaloids used to treat asthma. It was first recorded in the wild in 1777. Casual populations make changes in its distribution difficult to assess, but it may have declined in recent years.|Native range unknown, possibly America or the Black Sea region; now widespread in temperate and sub-tropical regions.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Daucus carota|A biennial herb of fairly infertile, well-drained, often calcareous, soils. Habitats include disturbed or open turf on chalk downs, rough grassland on roadsides, waysides and railway banks, quarries, chalk- and gravel-pits, and waste ground. 0?400 m (Connor Hill, S. Kerry).|Native|The map suggests a decline in D. carota at the northern fringes of its range. Three subspecies are recognised in our area: subsp. carota (Wild Carrot) occurs throughout the range of the species, the cultivated subsp. sativus (Carrot) is a casual on tips and a relic of cultivation, and subsp. gummifer is mapped separately.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Daucus carota subsp.sativus|A biennial herb with a swollen root, which occurs on rubbish tips and waste places, and as a relic of cultivation. Lowland.|Casual|D. carota subsp. sativus has long been grown in gardens and was recorded from the wild by 1928. It is apparently being recorded with increasing frequency.|The origin of the cultivated plant is uncertain, as there is no archaeological evidence for its cultivation before classical times. It is clearly related to the very variable wild D. carota complex.
Deschampsia cespitosa|A tufted perennial growing on poorly-drained, mildly acidic, neutral or basic soils in woodland, rough and marshy grasslands, fen-meadows, grass-heath, and a wide range of montane habitats. It can rapidly colonise bare ground and tolerates some disturbance. It is morphologically and cytologically variable and either proliferates or sets copious seed. 0-1235 m (Ben Macdui, S. Aberdeen).|Native|The distribution of D. cespitosa is stable. It often persists in overgrazed pasture because its unpalatable leaves have a high silica content. Subsp. cespitosa is widespread; the other two subspecies are mapped separately.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Deschampsia flexuosa|A loosely to densely tufted, clump or carpet-forming perennial of acid heaths, moorland, hill-pasture and open woodland, usually of Betula or Quercus. It grows on a wide range of freely-draining base-poor substrates, including leached soils over basic rocks. It can survive in sheep-grazed woodland. 0-1220 m (Ben Macdui, Banffs.).|Native|Though showing no general change from the 1962 Atlas, this species is declining locally in lowland areas due to the destruction of heathland and acidic grassland.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in E. Asia and N. America.
Deschampsia setacea|A densely tufted perennial of peaty or stony margins of lochs, shallow pools and seasonally inundated depressions on heaths, and on acid bogs. It appears to favour bare areas that are flooded in winter but dry in summer, and possibly where there is some lateral water movement. 0-320 m (Loch Morlich, Easterness).|Native|D. setacea has been lost since the 1930s from many lowland sites in E. England and Scotland through habitat destruction or undergrazing of heathland. In the Outer Hebrides, it may be extant in many squares for which there are only pre-1987 records. It is now much better recorded in Ireland than in the 1962 Atlas.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Descurainia sophia|An annual, or rarely biennial, herb which is locally abundant as a weed in arable fields in light soils in E. England. Elsewhere, it can occur in long-established populations, but is usually a casual in waste places. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|D. sophia suffered a considerable decline in lowland Britain before 1930, but there has been little change since the 1962 Atlas. It appears to be resistant to many herbicides.|The precise native range of D. sophia is uncertain; as an archaeophyte it has a Eurosiberian Temperate range and is naturalised in N. America and the S. hemisphere.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Dianthus armeria|An annual or short-lived perennial herb of open, disturbed sites, occurring in short grassland in pastures, roadsides, waysides and field margins, and as a casual on waste ground. It usually grows on dry, often mildly basic soils, but has been recorded on fen-peat. Lowland.|Native|It is difficult to distinguish native and alien populations in both Britain and Ireland. A marked decline was apparent before 1930 and this has continued, with most losses due to the conversion of pasture to arable or buildings, or from a lack of open areas at its remaining sites. It was first recognised in Ireland in 1993.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised elsewhere.     © L. Rooney
Dianthus deltoides|A perennial herb of dry, usually base-rich, soils overlying chalk and limestone, mica-schist or basalt; sometimes on metal-rich mining spoil or sandy soils and dunes. It can occur in short, closed grassland, but prefers an open sward broken by bare rock or soil. It also occurs as a garden escape. 0-355 m (Parsley Hay, Derbys.).|Native|Much of the decline of D. deltoides took place before 1930. Further losses have been offset by new discoveries. Nonetheless, many colonies are small and suffer from overgrazing and nutrient enrichment, or undergrazing and scrub encroachment.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Dianthus gratianopolitanus|This densely tufted perennial herb is now mainly confined to high, inaccessible crevices and ledges on Carboniferous limestone cliffs, though it is also found in tightly-grazed, species-rich limestone turf. It reproduces only by seed. Lowland.|Native|The species was once abundant in Cheddar Gorge (N. Somerset), but there is a long history of gathering plants, and the lower slopes were stripped of the plant long ago. However, populations have increased recently following statutory protection, scrub clearance and the re-instatement of grazing. It persists at some nearby sites to which it was deliberately introduced, and is a casual elsewhere.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Diapensia lapponica|A long-lived, slow-growing, dense, cushion-forming evergreen dwarf shrub, restricted in the British Isles to a small quartz-rich rock outcrop on an exposed mountain ridge, where it grows on acidic soils in a stony fell-field. It is uncertain whether viable seed is regularly produced, and recruitment from seed at the site is certainly very limited. 780 m (near Glenfinnan, Westerness).|Native|The population (currently about 1200 clumps or mats) and the area it occupies have not changed markedly since the discovery of the species in 1951.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.
Digitalis purpurea|A biennial or short-lived perennial, common on acidic soils in hedge banks, open woods and woodland clearings, on heath and moorland margins, river banks, montane rocky slopes, sea-cliffs, walls and waste land. It is often found in great abundance in disturbed or burnt areas, such as recently felled forestry plantations. 0-880 m (Mt Brandon, S. Kerry).|Native|The distribution of D. purpurea is stable, a major factor in its success being its prolific seed production and persistent seed bank. It is a common garden plant and can occur as an escape outside its native range and also on calcareous soils.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Digitaria ischaemum|An annual found on cultivated ground, rubbish tips, railway sidings and waste ground. It arises from wool shoddy, bird-seed, soya bean waste and cotton. Some populations in arable fields are well-established and long-lived (especially in Surrey). Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was first recorded in the wild in Britain in 1829 (Surrey).|Native temperate Eurasia; widely naturalised in N. America, Australasia and elsewhere.
Digitaria sanguinalis|An annual of bulb-fields and waste places on light soils in the Channel Islands and the Isles of Scilly. On the mainland it is spreading as a weed of garden centres, flower borders and pavement cracks; also, as a casual, on rubbish tips. Lowland.|Neophyte|D. sanguinalis is a wool, agricultural seed, grain and bird-seed alien, and was first recorded in the wild in 1690. It was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas, but is increasing, particularly in S. England.|Native of S. Europe, the Mediterranean region and S.W. Asia; now an almost cosmopolitan weed in warm-temperate and subtropical areas.
Diphasiastrum alpinum|An evergreen herb of short acidic grassland on mountains and moors, where it grows on moist but well-drained, thin peaty soils, especially those directly overlying rocks. More rarely it occurs on acidic sands. Vegetative propagation is much more frequent than sexual reproduction, which usually takes place on bare, disturbed ground. 0-1220 m (Ben Macdui, Banffs.).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of this species in the uplands since the 1962 Atlas. Some of its lowland sites have been lost to agricultural improvement, mainly before 1930.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © O.L. Pescott
Diphasiastrum complanatum|An evergreen, procumbent perennial herb of heaths and moors, where it typically grows on well-drained, sandy, often skeletal soils in dwarf Calluna heath. In Scotland its sites are usually Calluna-Arctostaphylos heath. Between 270 m (Canisp, W. Sutherland) and 960 m (Lochnagar, S. Aberdeen).|Native|The map shows only confirmed records, as many old records are based on abnormal D. alpinum. Burning and grazing of heaths may have caused the extinction of D. complanatum in lowland England but it may be under-recorded in montane areas.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a continental distribution in western Europe.
Diplotaxis muralis|An annual or short-lived perennial herb found in a variety of dry, open habitats. It is most frequent in waste places such as by railways, roads and on tips, but is also found on rocks, cliffs, walls and in gardens. It is occasionally cultivated and ploughed in as a `green manure`. Lowland.|Neophyte|First recorded in 1778 in a field of oats raised from imported seeds from a ship wrecked on the Kent coast, D. muralis has spread steadily, probably bolstered by other accidental introductions. It is still invading rural areas.|Native of C. & S. Europe and N. Africa; naturalised in Europe north of its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Diplotaxis tenuifolia|A perennial herb, most common in warm, dry habitats, occurring in waste ground, on walls and banks, and in quarries and railway sidings. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|The range of D. tenuifolia underwent a marked spread westwards in the late 19th century, and this is still continuing, albeit at a slower rate. Remarkably, the distribution is still centred on ports and industrial areas.|As an archaeophyte D. tenuifolia has a European Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Dipsacus fullonum|A robust biennial herb, frequent in rough grassland, wood margins, thickets and hedgerows, and on roadsides and waste ground on a very wide range of soil types. It fruits prolifically, and often colonises bare ground after disturbance. 0-365 m (Garrigill, Cumberland).|Native|It is impossible to distinguish native and introduced populations of this ruderal species and all records are mapped as if they are native. The distribution of D. fullonum is broadly similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas, but there are now many more records, perhaps often of casuals, outside its former core area.|European Temperate element.
Dipsacus fullonum sens.lat.||||
Dipsacus pilosus|A biennial herb occurring locally on woodland edges, rides and in clearings, in scrub and hedgerows, on ditch-sides and stream and river banks. It also grows in quarries and on waste ground. It prefers damp, calcareous soils. Lowland.|Native|D. pilosus has been lost from some squares since the 1962 Atlas. It needs disturbance for germination, and agricultural improvement or a lack of woodland management may account for the losses.|European Temperate element.
Disphyma crassifolium|This procumbent, succulent, semi-woody perennial is often grown in gardens in mild, coastal areas and has become well naturalised on walls, cliffs and sandy places near the sea. In Jersey, it also grows under conifers and in a salt marsh. Elsewhere, it occurs as a wool shoddy casual. Although viable seed is produced, reproduction in Britain is from the rooting of detached stem fragments. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species, known to be in cultivation in Britain by 1727, was first recorded as naturalised in 1936 on Tresco, Isles of Scilly.|Native of Cape Province, S. Africa; similar (possibly conspecific) taxa occur in Australasia.
Doronicum pardalianches|A rhizomatous perennial herb, well-naturalised in woods, plantations, and on roadsides and other shaded places. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species has been cultivated in Britain since the 16th century and is widely grown for ornament and formerly for medicinal purposes. It was first recorded in the wild in 1633 from Northumberland. It has consolidated and slightly expanded its range since the 1962 Atlas. Some mapped records may represent the hybrids D. x willdenowii and D. x excelsum.|Native of W. Europe, east to Germany and Italy.
Draba aizoides|This short-lived, cushion-forming, perennial herb is restricted to limestone rocks, where it grows in crevices in humic calcareous soils. Plants that occur in grassland and in bare soil away from rocks seldom survive. Lowland.|Native|Although D. aizoides was discovered as recently as 1795, genetic analysis has shown that the Gower (Glamorgan) populations are very different from those in continental Europe, supporting its claim to be native to Britain (John, 1992). Its overall distribution has remained stable, although some accessible colonies have been lost, up to quite recently, to collectors. Others have decreased in size for reasons that are unclear.|Mediterranean-montane element.
Draba incana|A morphologically variable biennial or perennial tufted herb, which is usually found on limestone rock ledges, screes and pavements, and occasionally in open grassland on thin droughted soils. It also occurs on sand dunes and, more rarely, on base-rich mica-schists and igneous rocks, and on sandstone cliffs. From sea level, but more commonly an upland plant, reaching 1080 m in the Breadalbanes (Mid Perth).|Native|D. incana is much better recorded in its core areas than in the 1962 Atlas. The reason for the apparent loss of outlying sites is unclear.|European Boreo-arctic Montane element; also in N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Draba muralis|A winter-annual, found as a native on limestone rocks on open skeletal soils, and on S.-facing ledges and screes. It is also a colonist on old walls, forest tracks and railways, and has been recorded as a garden weed where the conditions of its summer-dry, winter-moist, native habitat are mimicked. Generally lowland, but reaching 490 m in the Craven Pennines (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|Native populations of D. muralis are probably mostly stable; many other records are only casual, but it can be long persistent on some old walls.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.
Draba norvegica|A perennial tufted herb of base-rich rocks, occurring on rock ledges, in crevices in cliffs, on consolidated scree and in other bare places. Upland, from 310 m in Glendhu Forest (W. Sutherland) to 1160 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth), and more frequent at the higher end of that range.|Native|A few more sites have been discovered in recent years, suggesting that D. norvegica has previously been under-recorded, but in general the distribution is stable.|European Arctic-montane element, but absent from mountains of C. Europe; also in N. America.
Drosera anglica|An insectivorous, rosette-forming perennial herb growing in the wetter parts of raised and blanket bogs (often in standing water), in flushed valley bogs, on stony lake shores and, more rarely, in calcareous mires. Generally lowland, but with an exceptional record of 915 m from Glas Maol (Angus).|Native|D. anglica is the most striking of our sundews. It has been declining in England and C. Ireland since the 19th century due to drainage, eutrophication and peat extraction. Such losses continue, particularly in the English part of its range.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Drosera intermedia|An insectivorous, rosette-forming perennial herb found on wet heaths, valley- and raised bogs, and in a band at the edge of oligotrophic lochs, most often on acidic peat over which water continuously seeps. It is rarely found in Sphagnum, and then only when Sphagnum forms a fringe around bog pools. 0-335 m (Donegal).|Native|D. intermedia was lost from some sites in lowland England and in C. Ireland before 1900. It is decreasing through drainage, afforestation, peat extraction and the loss of lowland heath.|Suboceanic Temperate element; also in N. America.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Drosera rotundifolia|An insectivorous rosette-forming perennial herb of damp acid heath and moorland, bogs and upland flushes, growing among Sphagnum or on bare acid peat. It can be an abundant colonist of ditch sides cut through wet, peaty ground. 0-670 m (Snowdonia, Caerns.) and reportedly to 700 m in the Scottish Highlands.|Native|The overall distribution of D. rotundifolia has not changed since the 1962 Atlas. A decline in S.E. England was already apparent then and has continued in lowland areas because of habitat destruction.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Dryas octopetala|A dwarf procumbent and creeping shrub, typically found on basic ledges and rock crevices on mountains, but also occurring in upland calcareous grassland, on coastal shell-sand in N. Scotland, and limestone pavement in Ireland. From sea level in W. Sutherland and the Burren (Co. Clare) to 1035 m on Ben Avon (Banffs.).|Native|The distribution of this species appears to be stable overall, but populations in the Lake District are now very small. It is better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element, but absent from eastern N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Dryopteris aemula|A fern of moist but well-drained acidic to neutral soils of low base content, growing on banks, sea-cliffs and wooded slopes. In the Weald (Sussex) it occurs in deep, steep-sided wooded ravines which emulate its Atlantic habitats. Generally lowland, but reaching 640 m in Macgillycuddy`s Reeks (S. Kerry).|Native|D. aemula is much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas; it has recently been discovered in the New Forest (S. Hants.) for example. However, it is vulnerable to changes in humidity and clear-felling, and the coppicing of old woodland is responsible for the loss of some populations in the south.|Oceanic Temperate element; confined to the hyperoceanic zone in W. Europe and Macaronesia.
Dryopteris affinis|A deciduous or evergreen fern found in deciduous woodland, along rides in coniferous plantations, in ditches, on shady banks and road verges, usually on acidic substrates. In more oceanic areas, it grows in the open on well-drained W.- or S.W.-facing hillsides, scree slopes and mountain ledges. It is also found on brickwork in urban areas. 0?705 m (Little Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|D. affinis was greatly under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas but its distribution is probably stable. The three subspecies recognised by Stace (1997) are difficult to identify and are poorly recorded; they are not mapped here.|European Temperate element.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Dryopteris carthusiana|This deciduous fern is found in a range of damp habitats, including wet heaths, fens, mires, raised bogs, carr and wet woodland. It prefers rich alluvial soils with a high water table. More rarely it extends onto open moorland, possibly as a relic of former woodland. Generally lowland, but reaching 730 m in Atholl (E. Perth).|Native|D. carthusiana has declined in the last hundred years, wetland drainage, forest removal and agricultural improvement having taken their toll. However, it is much better recorded now than in the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.     © P. Shannon
Dryopteris cristata|This deciduous fern grows in mildly acidic `floating` fens that develop within or from more base-rich fens. It is characteristic of Sphagnum lawns, where it can tolerate the shade of invading Phragmites, and Salix and Betula scrub. It can persist in fen carr. Lowland.|Native|D. cristata was lost from most English sites outside East Anglia by 1970, through drainage, scrub encroachment and the loss of mown fen. Since then, losses have continued in Scotland and Suffolk. An increase in Norfolk records is due to a genuine expansion of its range.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; also in N. America.
Dryopteris dilatata|This deciduous fern grows on moderately to very acidic, well- to poorly-drained substrates. Habitats include deciduous and coniferous woodland, hedgerows, ditches, open moorland, rocky slopes, boulder scree and rock fissures. It can also be epiphytic in damp climates. 0-1050 m (N. of Loch Rannoch, Mid Perth), and reportedly to 1125 m in Scotland.|Native|The distribution of this species in the majority of its range is stable. In East Anglia it has become more frequent since 1930, as a decline in woodland management has increased the shade and humidity of woods and as it has invaded conifer plantations (Perring et al. 1964; Simpson, 1982).|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Dryopteris expansa|A deciduous fern found growing in open wet woodland and around rock outcrops at low altitudes, and in damp, sheltered hollows of upland boulder scree. Its substrates are usually mildly acidic, but it can grow in scree derived from quite base-rich mica-schists. 0-945 m (Stob Binnein, W. Perth).|Native|D. expansa was first mapped by Jermy et al. (1978). Some lowland sites have been lost to woodland clearance, but upland sites are relatively stable. The species is, however, difficult to identify and is almost certainly under-recorded.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.
Dryopteris filix-mas|D. filix-mas is a common deciduous fern of woodlands, hedgerows, ditches, roadside verges, stream banks, rocky hillsides, cliff ledges and scree slopes. It prefers light, well-drained but moist soils that are mostly acidic to neutral, though sometimes slightly basic. It is also found in urban habitats, including railway embankments, bridges, walls and gardens. 0-960 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|There is no evidence for an appreciable change in the distribution of this species.|Circumpolar Temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Dryopteris filix-mas agg.||||
Dryopteris oreades|This deciduous fern grows in colonies on well-drained rocky ledges, steep, loose scree slopes and in gullies. Substrates include relatively acidic sandstones, slates and mica-schist. It is very sensitive to grazing, often becoming confined to inaccessible ledges and unstable scree slopes in heavily grazed areas. From 105 m (Llyn Padarn, Caerns.) to 850 m (An Sgurr, Mid Perth and Coire na Creiche, N. Ebudes).|Native|D. oreades is now much better recorded than it was in the 1962 Atlas, although it is easily overlooked and is probably still under-recorded. There appear to have been some losses in Scotland, possibly through overgrazing.|Suboceanic Boreal-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Dryopteris remota|A deciduous fern of damp deciduous and open conifer woodland on more acidic soils. Lowland.|Native|This species, which is a fertile derivative of the hybrid between D. affinis and D. expansa, is now extinct in Britain and Ireland. Its possible occurrence at Loch Lomond (Dunbarton), where it was collected in 1894, is suspect and whilst the S.E. Galway plant has been well-studied in cultivation, it has never been re-found. A record from Kerry is based on an atypical sterile frond and needs confirmation; it is not mapped.|European Boreal-montane element, but absent from the Boreal zonobiome.
Dryopteris submontana|A deciduous fern of limestone pavement, screes and rock crevices, where moist, humus-rich soils develop. It prefers some degree of shelter, often growing in grikes, but is intolerant of shade. It can extend onto more exposed rock, but only where low woody scrub affords some protection. It is also recorded from limestone walls, and from other base-rich rocks. 0-465 m (Highfolds Scar, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|D. submontana is highly sensitive to grazing, and this may be the reason for its loss from old sites in Snowdonia and Arran. It is also highly vulnerable to quarrying, but otherwise there have been few losses since the 1962 Atlas.|Mediterranean-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Echinochloa crus-galli|A rather stout annual occurring as a casual of rubbish tips, waste places and cultivated ground, mainly from bird-seed but also from wool shoddy, soya-bean and other sources; sometimes sown as food for game (Beckett et al., 1999). Lowland.|Neophyte|E. crus-galli has been known in the British Isles since at least 1690, but increased after the Second World War when it was introduced with N. American seed (Rodwell, 2000). The distribution is now probably stable, and the species is reported to be persistent at some sites in S. England.|Native of warm-temperate and tropical regions of Europe, Asia & N. America; widely introduced as a fodder grass elsewhere.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Echium plantagineum|An annual or biennial herb growing as a weed in arable fields, on cliffs and in open sandy habitats by the coast. It has a long-lived seed bank, and populations vary greatly in size from year to year. It also occurs casually as a rare garden escape or outcast. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|E. plantagineum has been known from Jersey since 1690 but was first recorded in Cornwall in 1856. It is well-established in Jersey, West Penwith (W. Cornwall) and the Isles of Scilly, where it has been considered native by many authors. Elsewhere it is a casual.|As an archaeophyte E. plantagineum has a Mediterranean-Atlantic distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range, and a notorious weed in Australia.
Echium vulgare|A biennial of grassy and disturbed habitats on well-drained soils. It is found in bare places on chalk and limestone downs, on heaths, in quarries and chalk-pits, in cultivated and waste land, along railways and roadsides, and by the coast on cliffs, sand dunes and shingle. Generally lowland, but formerly reaching 365 m as an alien at Braemar (S. Aberdeen).|Native|Since 1930 E. vulgare has declined somewhat in frequency, due to agricultural intensification, reclamation, and the development of neglected ground.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Elatine hexandra|E. hexandra grows as an annual on exposed mud at the edge of lakes, reservoirs, ponds and flooded gravel-pits, or submerged on open substrates in shallow, oligotrophic to eutrophic water. When submerged it may sometimes persist as a short-lived perennial. Like many species in this habitat, it is subject to large annual fluctuations in numbers. 0-440 m (Lake Ferta, N. Kerry), and reportedly to 490 m in the Scottish Highlands.|Native|This species is now known to be much more frequent than was apparent in the 1962 Atlas. This is almost certainly attributable to more detailed recording of aquatic habitats.|European Temperate element.
Elatine hydropiper|Like E. hexandra, this is an annual which grows in shallow water or on damp mud or silty sand exposed at the water`s edge. Unlike that species it is confined to mesotrophic or eutrophic habitats. Lowland.|Native|Although E. hydropiper has disappeared from S.E. England (last recorded 1944), it was first recorded in Scotland in 1968 and has since been found in many more sites there. Mitchell (1981) suggests that it has been spread by birds, but it is possible that, like the equally inconspicuous E. hexandra, it may have been under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas. In Ireland its distribution has remained stable.|Eurosiberian Boreal-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Eleocharis acicularis|A rhizomatous perennial herb growing on the margins of lakes, ponds, reservoirs and rivers, in sites subject to winter flooding, and fully aquatic in shallow, still or slow-moving mesotrophic to eutrophic water. It roots into sand, gravel, mud or silt, often forming extensive lawns, but flowering only when exposed by falling water levels. 0-390 m (Drumore Loch, E. Perth).|Native|Submerged populations of E. acicularis are often overlooked. Furthermore, this species can reappear in former sites when conditions become suitable, and can colonise newly-flooded sand- and gravel-pits.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Eleocharis austriaca|A rhizomatous perennial herb found in the middle reaches of upland rivers, usually in slacker water in places which are to some extent protected from spates, such as in shallow bays. It also grows in ditches, pools, runnels and springs. The substrate is usually gravel with some silt deposition. 60-340 m (Ribblehead, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|E. austriaca was first found in 1947, but not recognised until 1960. Since then a number of new sites have been discovered, some only to be lost again as the plant responded to changed conditions. The greater frequency of spates due to altered land-use threatens its survival in its riverine habitat.|European Boreal-montane element.
Eleocharis multicaulis|A densely tufted perennial herb mainly of acid bogs, wet heath, valley mires, pools and wet hollows over peat, and at the edge of acidic lakes; also occurring in coastal dune-slacks. 0-610 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|Many sites for E. multicaulis were lost in the 19th century, due to drainage and changes in land use. Since 1962, it has been lost from many more sites in E. England and E. Scotland. Conversely, this rather inconspicuous species is now much better recorded in the uplands, and it is known from over six times as many 10-km squares in Wales as in the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Eleocharis palustris|An emergent rhizomatous perennial herb, found on the margins of ponds, lakes, slow-flowing rivers and streams, in fens, marshes, swamps and wet meadows, and in ditches, dune-slacks and saltmarshes. It grows in a wide range of organic and mineral soils, but rarely on acidic peat. It spreads by rhizomes and reproduces by seed. 0-550 m (Tyne Head, Cumberland).|Native|Some sites have been lost since the 1962 Atlas, where E. palustris was mapped as `all records`. Subsp. vulgaris is found throughout Britain and Ireland; subsp. palustris is mapped separately.|Eurasian Wide-temperate element.
Eleocharis parvula|A diminutive rhizomatous perennial growing on firm estuarine mud by tidal rivers, and in tidal pans in brackish grazing marshes. It occurs close to the upper limit of tidal influence, avoiding strongly saline areas. It reproduces vegetatively by turions, and by seed, but flowering and fruiting is very poor in many localities. Lowland.|Native|Colonies of E. parvula have been lost due to dredging and the cessation of grazing, which allows the development of taller vegetation. It is easily overlooked, and its discovery in E. Ross in 1999 suggests that it may be found in other northern sites.|European Temperate element; also in E. Asia and N. America.
Eleocharis quinqueflora|A perennial herb of base-rich marshes and fens, calcareous flushes on peaty soils, stony and muddy areas with seeping water, wet paths and short turf on banks; also in coastal cliff-flushes, dune-slacks and in the upper parts of saltmarshes. It requires open sites and is often dependent on grazing, cutting or disturbance. 0-915 m (Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|Many lowland sites for this species were lost in the 19th century. Since the 1962 Atlas it has been lost from half the extant 10-km squares in lowland England, because of drainage and lack of grazing. It is easily overlooked and is now better recorded elsewhere.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia and N. America.
Eleocharis uniglumis|A rhizomatous perennial herb, predominantly of coastal habitats, growing in damp dune-slacks, saltmarshes, short, brackish grassland and pools in the spray zone. It also occurs inland in base-rich, wet meadows and calcareous marshes, and locally, as in Oxfordshire, by springs with higher than normal sodium content. Generally lowland, but reaching 325 m at Ponterwyd (Cards.).|Native|The coastal distribution of E. uniglumis has probably remained stable in recent years, although it is much better recorded now than in the 1962 Atlas. There are many more records from inland areas, where it may previously have been overlooked.|Circumpolar Temperate element.
Eleogiton fluitans|A perennial herb found mainly on peaty, acidic substrates in, or on the margins of, slow-flowing streams, ditches, pools and the sheltered shores of some larger lakes and tarns, often in seasonally flooded sites. It also occurs in muddy hollows in grasslands and heaths, and the wet floors of disused quarries, sand- and gravel-pits. 0-435 m (Llyn Gwngu, Cards., and Styhead Tarn, Cumberland).|Native|Many of the losses of E. fluitans occurred before 1930, following drainage or the loss of lowland heathland, and this decline has continued in England since the 1962 Atlas. It is better recorded now elsewhere.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Elodea canadensis|This aquatic perennial herb has a broad habitat range, growing in mesotrophic to eutrophic waters from the shallows to depths of 3 metres or more. It favours still or slowly flowing sites where silt accumulates. All plants in our area are female and reproduce vegetatively. 0-440 m (Loch Loch, E. Perth).|Neophyte|This species was first recorded in Ireland in 1836 and in Britain in 1842, subsequently spreading rapidly. Since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`, it has disappeared from some areas, often being replaced by E. nuttallii.|Native of temperate N. America; widely naturalised in Europe and Australasia.
Elodea nuttallii|Like E. canadensis, this perennial herb is found in still or slowly flowing, shallow or deep water. It appears to be more restricted to eutrophic water than its congener, and it may be frequent even in highly disturbed canals and rivers. It is an effective coloniser of new habitats, despite the fact that it must spread vegetatively as all plants in our area are female. 0-315 m (Bethania, Cards.).|Neophyte|This species is grown by aquarists and pondkeepers. It was first recorded as naturalised in Britain in 1966 (Oxon), and has since spread rapidly. It was first recorded in Ireland in 1984, at Lough Neagh.|Native of temperate N. America; naturalised in Europe since 1939 and in Japan since the 1960s.
Elymus caninus|A loosely tufted perennial herb, intolerant of grazing, found in partially shaded sites in woodland, on river banks and roadside margins on free-draining, mainly base-rich, soils. It is also found in mountain areas in gullies, on cliffs and rock-ledges. 0-810 m (Creag na Caillich, Mid Perth).|Native|The overall distribution of E. caninus is stable. A variant with unawned lemmas, formerly described as Agropyron donianum, occurs on limestone rocks in C. and N. Scotland.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.
Elytrigia atherica|A rhizomatous perennial herb, growing on the margins of brackish creeks, in saltmarshes, saltmarsh-sand dune transitions, and on shingle banks and sea walls. In ungrazed situations it can form dense stands covering large areas to the almost total exclusion of other species. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas. Judging by the experience of Halliday (1997), it is likely that the sterile hybrid with E. repens (E. x oliveri), not mapped here, has sometimes been mis-recorded as E. atherica, thus obscuring the northern limit of this species.|European Southern-temperate element.
Elytrigia juncea|A rhizomatous perennial herb growing on or just above the strandline in loose sand, sometimes also on shingle. It is well known as a sand stabiliser on dune systems, forming low hummocky fore-dunes on the seaward side of the main Ammophila arenaria dunes. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of E. juncea since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element.
Elytrigia repens|A rhizomatous herb, found in a wide range of fertile, disturbed habitats including waste ground, roadsides, railway banks, arable land and rough grassland; also in coastal areas on sand dunes, shingle, sea walls and the margins of saltmarshes. It is a notorious weed of gardens and agricultural land. 0-430 m (Nenthead, Cumbria) and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of E. repens is stable. Two subspecies occur in our area; subsp. repens occurs throughout the range of the species, subsp. arenosa is mapped separately.|Eurosiberian Wide-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that the distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-temperate.
Empetrum nigrum|A low-growing evergreen shrub of well-drained acidic soils. It is found on moorlands and mountains, and on blanket mire where it can increase greatly after burning or where dry surfaces have been bared by erosion (Rodwell, 1991b). 0-1270 m (Cairngorms, S. Aberdeen).|Native|The distribution of E. nigrum is similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas, where subsp. hermaphroditum and subsp. nigrum were mapped separately as species. Subsp. nigrum occurs throughout the range of the species, subsp. hermaphroditum is mapped separately.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Epilobium alsinifolium|A montane perennial herb, spreading by stolons and occurring in or by mountain springs or streams, or on irrigated mountain ledges, often in moss carpets; sometimes temporarily established by streams at lower altitudes. It occurs on acidic and basic substrates, and tolerates eutrophic conditions. From 120 m on Eigg (N. Ebudes) to 1140 m on Bidean nam Bian (Main Argyll).|Native|The range of this species is largely unchanged since the 1962 Atlas, but is better recorded. It may still be present in many of the squares for which there are only pre-1987 records, but over-grazing may account for some local losses.|European Arctic-montane element; also in Greenland.
Epilobium anagallidifolium|A very shortly stoloniferous perennial herb, growing in mossy mountain flushes, on steep wet slopes and by streams; sometimes washed down and persisting for a while by streams and rivers at lower altitudes. It grows from 155 m near Inchnadamph (W. Sutherland) to 1190 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth), but usually in the upper part of that range.|Native|This montane species may still be present in many of the 10-km squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.
Epilobium brunnescens|A creeping perennial herb of moist open areas, on gravel, gritty or stony soils, on substrates ranging from acidic to very base-rich. It grows on streamsides, ditches, tracks and paths, screes, quarries, damp stone walls and banks. It spreads by rooting at the nodes, and by seed, and is well-naturalised in many remote localities. 0-915 m (Y Garn, Caerns.) and reportedly higher in Ireland.|Neophyte|This species was first recorded in the wild in 1904 in Edinburgh, and its subsequent spread in the wild has accelerated from the 1930s. It is much more widespread than when mapped in the 1962 Atlas, particularly in the north and west.|Native of New Zealand.
Epilobium ciliatum|A perennial herb found on disturbed ground such as in gardens, shrubberies, felled woodland, waste ground, on walls and in pavement cracks. It spreads readily by seed, often colonising newly disturbed sites. It occasionally grows in semi-natural habitats, including marshes. 0?450 m (above Garrigill, Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species was first collected in 1891, but was unrecognised until the 1930s. It established itself most strongly in south-east England, and has spread rapidly north and west. The current map shows a dramatic extension from the 1962 Atlas and it is now one of our most frequent aliens.|Native of N. America; widely naturalised in C. & N. Europe.
Epilobium hirsutum|A tall perennial herb of open habitats, including ditches, marshes, the edges of streams or ponds, damp woodland margins and waste ground. It thrives in wet, fertile, neutral to basic habitats, although it can tolerate dry ground. It spreads from seed, or from branching rhizomes which may result in dense stands. 0-365 m (Derbys.), with an exceptional record at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of E. hirsutum is much the same as in the 1962 Atlas, although increases in Wales, N. England and S.W. Scotland suggest that it may have expanded into these areas.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Epilobium lanceolatum|A perennial herb which grows in various dry habitats in S.W. England, including roadsides, walls, banks, quarries, streets and dunes. Elsewhere, it is more frequently a garden weed. 0-400 m (Dartmoor, S. Devon).|Native|There have been both apparent gains and losses of E. lanceolatum since the 1962 Atlas which are not easy to interpret, especially as it is a species which must be unfamiliar to many recorders. It has either spread, or been more comprehensively recorded, in S.W. England. Elsewhere, some garden weed occurrences may be impermanent, but nurseries act as a vector for fresh colonists.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.
Epilobium montanum|A perennial herb growing in woods, hedge banks, gardens and waste ground, and sometimes on rock ledges or gullies, often in shade. It spreads by wind-borne seed. 0?790 m (Snowdon, Caerns.), with an exceptional record at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|There is no evidence for changes in the national distribution of E. montanum since the 1962 Atlas; it is a frequent plant throughout its range.|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia.     © P. Shannon
Epilobium obscurum|A perennial herb found on cultivated or waste ground, marshes, streamsides and woodland margins. It thrives in damp habitats, but tolerates dry ground, and spreads by wind-borne seed and long stolons. 0-775 m (Mangerton Mountain, S. Kerry) and 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|This species has been more comprehensively recorded than it was in the 1962 Atlas, particularly in N. Ireland and W. Britain. There have, however, been local losses in E. England and W. Scotland. The reasons for these losses are unclear, unless recorders in the 1950s were less familiar with the alien E. ciliatum and reported it as this species.|European Temperate element.
Epilobium palustre|A stoloniferous perennial herb of wet acidic sites, occurring in bogs, marshes, flushes and ditches, and on stream or lake margins. It spreads by wind-borne seed and by turions which form at the ends of the stolons and can be carried off by winter floods. 0-795 m (Foel Fras, Caerns.) and 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|E. palustre was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. The current map shows losses, particularly in S.E. England, and analysis of the database reveals that most of these have occurred since 1950. These declines are probably due to agricultural improvement, drainage and eutrophication.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Epilobium parviflorum|A perennial herb, most frequent in marshes, fens, streamsides and other disturbed wet places, spreading by air-borne seed. However, the species will also grow in dry habitats, including quarries, banks and waste ground and as a street weed. Generally lowland, reaching 365 m in Derbyshire.|Native|There is no evidence of significant change in the range of E. parviflorum since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Epilobium roseum|A perennial herb of damp disturbed places, found near streams and canals, in woods, on shaded banks, and in street gutters and gardens. Generally lowland, but reaching 560 m on Wold Fell (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|E. roseum is a distinctive species, especially once seen, which is much better recorded now than it was in the 1962 Atlas. The current map, however, shows many losses at the 10-km square level, and there seems to have been some retrenchment of distribution in favour of E. ciliatum, although the patterns are difficult to interpret.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Epilobium tetragonum|A perennial herb occurring in damp or dry habitats including cultivated or waste ground, gardens, quarries, streamsides and woodland margins. It spreads by seed. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of E. tetragonum in Britain remains stable and essentially southern, though it is now far better recorded. Many records have been made in Scotland since the 1962 Atlas, but none have been verified by expert examination and all have been treated as probable errors for E. obscurum or other species. It has increased in Ireland.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Epipactis atrorubens|A perennial herb found mostly on bare rock or well-drained skeletal soils overlying limestone. Habitats include exposed scree slopes, open grassy banks, shaded grikes of limestone pavements and ledges on cliff and quarry faces. Reproduction is by seed but most populations are small and often include many non-flowering plants. 0-610 m (Gleann Beag, E. Perth).|Native|The overall distribution of E. atrorubens is stable. It is now recorded from more sites than ever before, but some populations have been lost as a result of quarrying activities and others are at risk from overgrazing by deer and rabbits.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Epipactis helleborine|A rhizomatous perennial herb of calcareous to slightly acidic soils. Habitats include coniferous and deciduous woodland, hedgerows, shady banks, streamsides, roadsides, Alnus carr, dune-slacks, limestone pavement and screes. It may invade secondary woodland and also occurs in urban habitats, particularly abandoned gardens; it is said to be more common in Glasgow than anywhere else in Britain (Allan & Woods, 1993). 0-350 m (Ystradfellte, Brecs.).|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. The overall distribution is stable.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Epipactis leptochila|A rhizomatous perennial herb found in three distinct habitats: the deep shade of Fagus woods on calcareous substrates; under Betula on well-drained stony soils and spoil, often polluted with lead and zinc; and on the edges of dune-slacks where it grows amongst Salix repens and can spread into neighbouring conifer plantations. Lowland.|Native|This species is much better recorded now than it was in the 1962 Atlas, particularly in N. England and S. Scotland. Coastal dune populations are sensitive to both under- and over-grazing by rabbits, while inland sites have been lost to woodland clearance and coniferisation.|European Temperate element.
Epipactis palustris|A rhizomatous perennial herb of neutral to calcareous fens, marshes, damp pastures, meadows and dune-slacks. It prefers flushed or seasonally inundated areas where competition from other vegetation is reduced. Other habitats include slumped terraces of wet, calcareous sea-cliffs and disused gravel-pits. Lowland.|Native|Drainage of fens and marshes has caused a considerable decline in this species, with most losses occurring before 1930. It is vulnerable to changes in water-level and to nutrient enrichment. The increase in Irish records since the 1962 Atlas is a result of improved recording.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Epipactis phyllanthes|A rhizomatous perennial herb typically found in sparsely vegetated, shaded places on dry, acidic, humus-poor substrates. Habitats include Fagus woods on flinty clays or sandstones, Pinus and Betula scrub on the Bagshot sands, Corylus coppice on sandy alluvium, and on sand dunes. Lowland.|Native|Populations of E. phyllanthes tend to be sporadic, often not persisting for longer than about thirty years. It has declined in S. England, mostly through woodland clearance, but new sites have been found further north, some of which are increasing in size.|European Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Epipactis purpurata|A perennial herb found in a range of woodland types. It is most frequent in densely shaded Fagus woods, particularly those on `clay-with-flints` deposits, but is also found on calcareous, and occasionally acidic, sands and clays in mixed woodland and coppices of Corylus and Carpinus. Lowland.|Native|Woodland clearance caused a decline in E. purpurata before 1930, and this may have continued (to a lesser degree) since the 1962 Atlas. It is easily overlooked, however, and is now much better recorded. It requires a particular level of shade; it has increased in Hertfordshire due to a cessation of coppicing.|European Temperate element.
Epipactis youngiana|A rhizomatous perennial herb originally found growing in an oak wood on clay soil, and on mildly acidic soils polluted with zinc and lead metals. It has since been found on the steep, lightly wooded slopes of coal-waste bings in Scotland. It is self-pollinated. Lowland.|Native|This species was first identified in the 1970s, but not described until 1982. It is thought to result from hybridisation between E. helleborine and either E. leptochila (in England and Wales) or E. phyllanthes (in Scotland), with the new species emerging as a colonist of man-made habitats. Two colonies have been lost to woodland clearance. It is probably under-recorded.|Endemic.
Epipogium aphyllum|A saprophytic herb usually growing in deep leaf-litter in Fagus woods on chalk, with little or no associated ground flora. It is also occasionally recorded from Quercus woodland. The underground rhizomes have considerable longevity but the stems are short-lived and may not be produced annually. Although its flowers are pollinated by bees, seed is rarely produced. Lowland.|Native|E. aphyllum has appeared only sporadically since 1970 and, although there have been rumours of sightings, it has not been reliably recorded in Britain since 1986. The site at which it was last seen is now a commercial forest planted with conifers.|Eurasian Boreal-montane element.     © Tom Cairns
Equisetum arvense|The natural habitats of this deciduous herb include river banks, fixed dune grassland, sea-cliffs and montane flushes, but it has become closely associated with human activity. Being long-lived, vigorous, resistant to herbicides and tolerant of drier conditions than other Equisetum species, it is now frequent on roadsides, railways, paths, soil banks and waste ground, and in quarries and gardens, where its spread is assisted by rhizome fragments. 0?1005 m (Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of this species.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Equisetum fluviatile|This deciduous herb grows in a wide variety of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, from ditches and small ponds to large lakes and sheltered rivers. It tolerates a remarkable range of water and substrate pH, nutrient levels, substrate type and water depth, and is often a pioneer species in freshwater successions. 0-915 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|Like many aquatic plants, this species is now much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas. Most of the losses in S.E. England have taken place since 1950, reflecting the loss of small wetlands and the unsympathetic management of remaining sites.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Equisetum hyemale|A slow-growing, evergreen herb forming colonies of shoots from branching rhizomes. It prefers heavy soils derived from sand or clay which are permanently moist and have a high mineral and silica content. It is usually found in shaded open woodland beside streams and rivers, but also grows in base-rich moorland flushes and sand dunes. 0?610 m (Glen Lyon, Mid Perth).|Native|Most losses of E. hyemale occurred before 1930, probably due to drainage and an increase in grazing and trampling of riverbanks by livestock. However, many new sites have been discovered since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Equisetum palustre|A deciduous herb associated with marshes, damp pastures, ditches, dune-slacks, streams, rivers and mountain flushes. It tolerates a wide range of soil types and substrates, provided that they are permanently damp and adequately base-rich. 0-945 m (Meall nan Tarmachan, Mid Perth).|Native|Mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, there is little evidence for a change in the distribution of this species, although some lowland sites have been lost to drainage and agricultural improvement.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Equisetum pratense|An evergreen herb, typically found on sloping sites where the substrate is derived from calcareous alluvial silts or sand, especially lightly wooded stream banks in the lower parts of upland valleys. It can also extend onto open moorland, and is found on grassy slopes beneath base-rich upland cliffs. 0-915 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|The considerable increase in records since the 1962 Atlas is due to better recording. Although most populations are long-lived, cone production is usually very poor, possibly because of climatic conditions, and Page (1997) suggests that the species is in slow decline.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Equisetum ramosissimum|An erect evergreen herb found growing in rough grassland near the sea, on sand or clay soil. Lowland.|Neophyte|E. ramosissimum was once regarded as possibly native but is now considered to have been introduced. In N. Lincolnshire it was found in 1947 on a river bank that was straightened between 1880 and 1887 and it is thought to be a ballast alien. In N. Somerset it was not correctly identified until 1986, despite having been known at the site since 1963.|A Eurasian Southern-temperate species.
Equisetum sylvaticum|A deciduous, colony-forming herb which generally grows on deep, mildly acidic, often peaty soils that are kept permanently damp by flushing. It occurs on the lower slopes of mountain valleys, steep streamsides, wet ledges and open flushes, beside lakes and on the edges of drainage ditches. It also occurs on wet road verges and railway embankments. 0-850 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|There is little evidence of a decline in upland areas since the 1962 Atlas. The decline in the British lowlands was already apparent then, and has continued.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © Pete Stroh
Equisetum telmateia|A robust, deciduous, colony-forming herb of base-rich clay soils in sites with spring-lines, permanent seepages and open flushes, especially in areas where porous rocks are interbedded with clays. It prefers open habitats and is particularly frequent on eroding sea- and river-cliffs, but also grows on roadsides and railway embankments. Lowland to 365 m in Fossdale (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|This species has apparently become more frequent in inland parts of S.E. England in the last 200 years (Kent, 1975). There is, however, little evidence for any appreciable change since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element; also in western N. America (subsp. braunii).     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Equisetum variegatum|An evergreen, prostrate herb found in a wide variety of habitats, including dune-slacks, river shingle, upland flushes and stony loch-shores. It is a calcicole and a poor competitor; its sites are usually open and often winter-flooded. In Ireland a more vigorous, upright ecotype is found mostly on canal banks. 0-1040 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|There is some evidence of decline in this species, but the position is obscured as so many sites have been discovered since the 1962 Atlas. Upland sites are sensitive to over-stocking, whilst lowland populations have been lost due to drainage and sand dune development.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Eranthis hyemalis|A small, tuberous perennial, dying back in summer. It is naturalised, sometimes in large numbers, in open woodland, grassland and scrub associated with habitation, under park trees, in gardens and on road verges. Lowland.|Neophyte|E. hyemalis was introduced as a garden plant by 1596, and has become thoroughly established in some areas; it was first recorded in the wild in 1838. The eastern distribution was already apparent in the 1962 Atlas. The great increase since then is probably due to a genuine increase in frequency and the improved recording of aliens.|Native of S. Europe from Italy to Bulgaria, and of Turkey; widely naturalised in Europe outside its native range.
Erica ciliaris|This low shrub occurs on moist heathland, extending into relatively dry heath, and also into wet valley bogs, mainly on the drier hummocks. Seedlings establish on bare ground, but in closed habitats reproduction is usually vegetative. Generally lowland, but reaching 400 m on Dartmoor (S. Devon).|Native|Much heathland with E. ciliaris in Dorset has been lost to forestry, but recently this trend has been stabilised or reversed and there is now some indication of a natural extension in its range. The Cornish sites are probably relics of larger populations. Other populations may be native or introductions to natural habitats.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Erica cinerea|This small shrub occurs on thin, acidic, peaty or mineral soils in well-drained situations, on dry heaths, and as an occasional undershrub in open-canopy Pinus sylvestris or Quercus woodland. It is found in some calcareous grasslands that are leached and acidic at the surface (`limestone heath`). 0-790 m (Purple Mountain, S. Kerry); a report from 1220 m in the Grampians is very doubtful (Preston & Hill, 1997).|Native|E. cinerea has declined in S. England from loss of heathland habitat, and has disappeared from many former `chalk heath` sites through encroachment of rank grass and scrub following reduction in sheep and rabbit grazing.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Erica erigena|A shrub found in damp or boggy, more or less base-rich moorland, usually on slopes, often close to streams or on lake shores. Lowland.|Native|Although it is normally regarded as a native, Foss & Doyle (1988) have suggested that E. erigena might have been introduced to Ireland in the 15th century by pilgrims or traders. There is no indication of any appreciable change in its distribution in recent decades.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Erica mackaiana|The habitats of this low shrub are blanket mire and rocky wet heath, where it occupies a somewhat narrower range of habitat than E. tetralix, avoiding the wettest sites. It grows on deep peat. The Irish plants of E. mackaiana never set seed. Their pollen fertility varies, but they produce sufficient fertile pollen to hybridise freely with E. tetralix to give the sterile hybrid E. x stuartii. Lowland.|Native|Populations of E. mackaiana appear to be stable.|Oceanic Temperate element; restricted to N.W. Spain and Ireland.
Erica tetralix|A sprawling low shrub found in a very wide range of mires and wet heaths, extending into drier heath in S.W. Britain. It is usually on wet, nutrient-poor organic soils, but can also grow in mesotrophic or eutrophic conditions. Generally from the lowlands to c. 670 m, but reaching 880 m in Coire Etchachan (S. Aberdeen).|Native|E. tetralix was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that the widespread decline in S. England has taken place since 1950. In common with other heathland and bog species it has suffered from habitat loss, but it remains common wherever suitable conditions occur.|Suboceanic Temperate element.
Erica vagans|A locally abundant or co-dominant drawf srub in heathland with Calluna and Erica cinerea, or Ulex spp., often with calcicolous herbs, over ultrabasic rocks (serpentine and gabbro); also found on moist gley soils. Seedlings and plantlets can be frequent, but often die of drought; older plants regenerate from the base after winter burning. Lowland.|Native|In Britain, about one third of the heaths containing E. vagans were lost between 1908 and 1980. The remainder now have statutory protection, and the distribution seems stable. In Co. Fermanagh E. vagans is treated here as native but may be a prehistoric introduction.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Erigeron acer|An annual or perennial herb of open, well-drained, skeletal neutral or calcareous soils, often on warm, S.-facing slopes. Habitats include sand dunes, sand-pits, spoil and waste heaps from quarries, railway ballast, industrial waste and cinders. It also grows on rock outcrops, especially of chalk and limestone and on mortared walls. 0-430 m (Banffs.).|Native|The overall range of E. acer is stable, although there are now many more records from the English Midlands than there were in the 1962 Atlas, and it appears to have declined locally in some areas, particularly parts of S.E. and E. England.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Erigeron borealis|A perennial rhizomatous herb found on unstable, basic, mostly S.-facing cliff ledges of mica-schist, usually adjacent to grazed, herb-rich grassland. The surviving sites are inaccessible to grazing by sheep and deer. From 640 m on Craig Maud (Angus) to 1100 m on Creag an Fhitich (Mid Perth).|Native|Pre-1970 sites for E. borealis in the eastern Highlands of Scotland were lost before 1930, and the current distribution of the species may be stable. However, the size of some populations varies greatly from year to year, and long-term trends are unclear.|Eurosiberian Arctic-montane element; it reaches its southern limit in Scotland, being replaced by the very similar E. neglectus in the Alps.     © Pete Stroh
Erigeron karvinskianus|A perennial herb, well-established on walls, rock outcrops and cliffs, in cracks in pavements and on stony banks, to which it has usually spread by seed from nearby gardens. Lowland.|Neophyte|E. karvinskianus has been cultivated in Britain since 1836 and is widely grown in frost-free areas, particularly in the Channel Islands, in coastal areas of S.W. England and S. Wales and in sheltered urban sites. It was first recorded as naturalised in 1860, at St Peter Port, Guernsey, where it was locally abundant by the 1890s. It has shown a marked increase since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of C. America (Mexico); naturalised in W. & S. Europe.
Erinus alpinus|This short-lived, semi-evergreen perennial herb occurs in the crevices of old walls and in other stony places, often on limestone or bricks with lime mortar. It seeds freely and thrives in full sun. Generally lowland, but reaching 350 m at Alston (Cumberland).|Neophyte|E. alpinus is a popular garden plant, cultivated by 1739, which seeds prolifically and becomes well-naturalised in new sites. It was known from the wild by 1867. There seems to have been a considerable spread since the 1962 Atlas, perhaps in part a result of the greater propensity of botanists to record plants on garden walls.|Native of the mountains of S.W. and S.C. Europe.
Eriocaulon aquaticum|The perennial rosettes of E. aquaticum grow on peat or on inorganic substrates at the edge of oligotrophic lakes and pools. It ranges from levels which are often exposed above the water to those which are permanently submerged. Little is known about its reproductive ecology. Generally lowland, but reaching 300 m in Glen Lough (W. Cork).|Native|This species still has the restricted distribution mapped in the 1962 Atlas, the only significant change being its discovery in mainland Scotland in 1967. Its habitat is so widespread in W. Scotland that it is difficult to explain its limited range there.|Oceanic Boreal-montane element; in Europe restricted to Britain and Ireland but widespread in N. America.
Eriophorum angustifolium|A rhizomatous perennial of open, wet, peaty ground, both calcareous and acidic, sometimes colonising peat-cuttings and often growing in standing water. Its habitats range from upland blanket bogs and hillside flushes to wet heaths and marshy meadows in the lowlands. 0-1100 m (Ben Alder, Westerness).|Native|Drainage, groundwater extraction and the cessation of grazing at some sites have considerably reduced the abundance of this species in the lowlands. Analysis of the database reveals that many losses took place before 1950, but have continued since then. In Hertfordshire, most sites were lost by 1900, and all by 1979 (James & Goldsmith, 1993).|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element.     © L. Rooney
Eriophorum gracile|A rhizomatous perennial found in the wettest parts of bogs, transitional mires, poor fens and on the edge of Alnus carr, typically over liquid peats. Its sites are calcareous or moderately acidic, and have some water movement. Lowland.|Native|Since 1930, E. gracile has become extinct in Norfolk and Dorset and declined to one site in Surrey and two in Hampshire. However, it appears to be stable in Wales and Ireland, where it has been discovered since the 1962 Atlas. Losses have been due to drainage, afforestation and infilling.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; rare and declining in Europe and Fennoscandia.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Eriophorum latifolium|A rhizomatous perennial herb of open sites, growing in wet, base-rich lowland meadows and mires, and in fens and calcareous flushes in the uplands. 0-670 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|This species was lost from some of its pre-1970 squares in the 19th century, and from most before 1930. These losses have continued in lowland areas as a result of afforestation and agricultural intensification. The species is much better recorded in W. Scotland, the Scottish Borders and in Ireland than it was for the 1962 Atlas.|European Boreo-temperate element.
Eriophorum vaginatum|A tussock-forming rhizomatous perennial herb of wet heaths and mires, including blanket- and raised bogs. It is characteristic of wet peaty moorlands, often dominant or co-dominant with Calluna vulgaris, where it survives, or even increases, after burning. Its sites are always open and almost always acidic. 0-945 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|Many lowland sites for E. vaginatum had been lost by 1930. Since then, further losses have occurred in the N. Midlands, but it remains abundant in many areas of N. & W. Britain and in Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.     © P. Shannon
Erodium cicutarium||||
Erodium cicutarium agg.|Annuals of well-drained sandy and rocky places, sand dunes, summer-parched grasslands and heaths; they are also found on roadsides, stone walls and railway ballast, and are common wool aliens. Generally lowland, but reaching 420 m on Kirkstone Pass (Westmorland).|Native|There is little evidence of appreciable change in the two species included here (E. cicutarium and E. lebelii) since the 1962 Atlas, though they may be spreading in some inland areas beside salt-treated roads. E. cicutarium occurs throughout range of the aggregate, E. lebelii is mapped separately.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.
Erodium lebelii|An annual of barish places in stabilised sand dunes. Lowland.|Native|The map of E. lebelii in Perring & Sell (1968) was based on herbarium material. The current range is broadly similar, although the map suggests that in some areas recent recorders have not distinguished this species from the closely related E. cicutarium. Some pre-1970 records of E. lebelii could be errors for the taxonomically uncertain E. cicutarium subsp. dunense.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Erodium maritimum|"An annual of trampled or closely-grazed cliff-top grasslands, disturbed sand dunes and gull-infested sea-cliffs, and around coastal settlements on walls and pavements. Inland, it has been recorded from limestone grassland (Somerset), in heathland areas by sandy tracks and gravel workings and, rarely, as an introduction on railway ballast. Lowland.
 



      Trends    

Native (change +0.38). There has been no appreciable change in distribution since the 1962 <i>Atlas</i>, though it has gone from most of its presumed native inland sites. However, in Dorset inland records associated with quarrying have shown a distinct increase.

Erophila glabrescens|This segregate has been recorded from limestone rocks, pavements and hill-slopes, chalk downland, rocky river- and streamsides, river shingle, sand dunes and sandy grassland, walls, roadside verges, crevices in concrete and in pavements, loose road metal and gravelly paths. Lowland.|Native|E. glabrescens was first recognised in national floras in 1987 (Clapham et al., 1987). It is not always easy to separate this polyploid species from E. verna sens. str.

Erophila majuscula|The habitats of E. majuscula are typical of those of the aggregate as a whole: limestone rocks and thin limestone turf, chalk downland (where it may grow on ant hills), sand dunes and sandy ground inland, walls, railway lines and gravel paths. Lowland.|Native|The three species of Erophila currently recognised in Britain were not described in national floras until 1987 (Clapham et al., 1987). The diploid E. majuscula is the most distinctive and appears to be the rarest, especially outside S. England. It is certainly under-recorded.|World range uncertain.
Erophila verna||||
Erophila verna sens.lat.|Typical semi-natural habitats of E. verna include limestone cliffs and pavements, sand dunes, sandy banks and coastal and riparian shingle. It is also frequent in quarries, sand- and gravel-pits and on lime-mine spoil heaps, walls, railway clinker, rubble and waste ground and cracks in pavements. 0?770 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|This polyploid is the most frequent of the three segregate Erophila species. The high proportion of pre-1970 records reflects the fact that many records are derived from herbarium specimens studied by Rich & Lewis (1999); it does not signify a decline. The species is still under-recorded.|World range uncertain.
Erucastrum gallicum|An annual, occasionally persisting in quarries and along tracks on chalk soils, but almost always casual on roadsides and waste ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|E. gallicum was first recorded from the wild in 1863. In Ireland it is more frequent now than it was in the 1962 Atlas. It has spread widely on Salisbury Plain (S. Wilts.) as a result of disturbance from army activity. It is apparently sown in order to bind and stabilise steep chalk road cuttings (Brewis et al., 1996).|Native of the Pyrenees and C. Europe; widely naturalised elsewhere in Europe and in N. America.
Eryngium campestre|A perennial herb of well-drained neutral or calcareous soils in old pastures and coastal grassland in S.W. England, where it is very long-established and was once considered to be native. Elsewhere, short-lived or casual populations have been reported from pastures, roadsides and rough ground. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|E. campestre was first recorded in the wild in Devon, where it was seen by Ray on Monday 7th July, 1662. Sites in Devon and Somerset have statutory protection and the species is persisting there with appropriate management.|As an archaeophyte E. campestre has a European Southern-temperate distribution.
Eryngium maritimum|A glaucous, spiny perennial herb confined to coasts, occurring mainly on incipient and mobile sand dunes and occasionally on shingle. Lowland.|Native|This species disappeared from most of its sites in N.E. England and E. Scotland before 1930, for reasons which are unclear. There has evidently been some further decline since then.|European Southern-temperate element.
Erysimum cheiranthoides|An annual, locally frequent in arable fields but common also as a weed of waste ground, roadsides and railways. It prefers sandy ground. Mainly lowland, but recorded at 435 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Archaeophyte|There is archaeological evidence of this species in Bronze Age and Roman Britain. It is susceptible to herbicides and has declined since 1950 as an arable weed, but in other habitats it seems stable or is even increasing as a contaminant of clover- or grass-seed.|Native range uncertain but thought to include E. Europe, Siberia and western N. America; now a widely naturalised plant with a Circumpolar Boreo-temperate distribution.
Erysimum cheiri|A perennial herb widely naturalised on cliffs, old walls and rocks, particularly on calcareous substrates where it is often very persistent. It tolerates poor, thin, dry soils, but a warm site is essential. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|E. cheiri has been cultivated since medieval times, and its first record as a wild plant was as long ago as 1548. There has been no change in its range since it was mapped in the 1962 Atlas; the increase in frequency may reflect the more enthusiastic recording of alien species in recent years.|A plant of garden origin, widely naturalised in W. & C. Europe.
Euonymus europaeus|A deciduous shrub or small tree found in hedges, scrub and open deciduous woodland on free-draining base-rich soils, particularly those overlying chalk and limestone. It is also planted in woodlands, hedgerows and gardens from where it can become well-naturalised in the wild. 0-380 m (Craig-y-Benglog, Merioneth).|Native|The considerable increase in records of this species in N. England, Wales and Ireland since the 1962 Atlas probably results from better recording of a shrub which is easily overlooked when it is not fruiting. In Scotland, at the northern edge of its range, it is particularly difficult to determine whether some populations are native or alien.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Eupatorium cannabinum|A perennial herb found on base-enriched soils in a wide range of damp or wet habitats, including marginal vegetation by ponds, lakes, rivers and canals, tall-herb fen, fen-meadows, marshes, wet woodland, mires and wet heath; also flushed areas on sea-cliffs and in dune-slacks. It is infrequent in dry habitats, but is found in dry woods and on hedge banks, on waste ground, and even on dry chalk banks. 0-350 m (Ystradfellte, Brecs.).|Native|The distribution of E. cannabinum has shown little change since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.     © P. Shannon
Euphorbia amygdaloides|A rhizomatous perennial herb of neutral or acidic soils in old woods and shaded hedge banks, more rarely found amongst scrub and around rock outcrops. In woods it is a light-demanding plant which may re-appear from buried seed after coppicing. It is also cultivated as a garden plant, where it is persistent and can be very invasive. Generally lowland, reaching 455 m at Rhydymain (Merioneth).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas. The native subsp. amygdaloides occurs throughout the native range of the species; the alien subsp. robbiae is mapped separately.|European Temperate element.
Euphorbia cyparissias|A rhizomatous perennial herb widely naturalised as a garden escape in waste places such as tracksides, roadsides, walls and sandy banks, and also in calcareous grassland and amongst scrub. It can colonise arable margins, and may become established on sand dunes. It also grows on some racecourses where it could have been introduced with horse-feed or bedding. Lowland.|Neophyte|E. cyparissias was cultivated in Britain by 1640 and was first recorded in the wild in 1799. It is sometimes regarded as a native of chalk grassland in S.E. England. There are many more records now than in the 1962 Atlas.|A European Temperate species, absent as a native from much of W. Europe; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Euphorbia esula x waldsteinii (E. x pseudovirgata)|This perennial hybrid is naturalised on waste ground, grassy banks, road verges, tracks and in hedgerows. Lowland.|Neophyte|E. x pseudovirgata may have been originally introduced with grain, timber or fodder for horses, and it also occurs as a garden escape. Its dates of introduction are obscure, as it was initially confused with E. esula, but it was known from the wild by at least 1937. Most of the records of E. esula agg. in the 1962 Atlas represent this hybrid, and there has been little change in its distribution since then.|This taxon occurs naturally with its parents in C. & E. Europe.     © L. Rooney
Euphorbia exigua|An annual of arable land, less frequently occurring in other areas of disturbed ground such as gardens, waste ground and bare patches in dry grassland. It favours dry, light and base-rich soils in sunny situations. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|This species was lost from many areas of Ireland and N. and W. Britain before 1930. Since the 1962 Atlas, it has declined further, especially in S.E. England. Most losses are due to the intensification of agriculture, particularly the increased use of herbicides.|As an archaeophyte E. exigua has a European Southern-temperate distribution.     © P. Shannon
Euphorbia helioscopia|An annual growing in cultivated and disturbed ground in gardens, on waste ground and in arable fields, particularly with root and leaf crops. It thrives on dry, well-drained, neutral to base-rich soils in sun-warmed situations. The seeds may be dispersed by ants. Mainly lowland, but ascending to 450 m in Clun Forest (Salop).|Archaeophyte|There has been no change in the overall distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, but the map suggests a decline at the edges of its range.|As an archaeophyte E. helioscopia has a Eurasian Southern-temperate distribution, but it is naturalised in N. America so its distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Euphorbia hyberna|A rhizomatous perennial of woodland glades, hedgerows and shaded stream banks, growing best when receiving dappled sun for at least part of the day. Lowland, reaching 500 m in Waterville (S. Kerry) and reportedly to 550 m elsewhere in Co. Kerry.|Native|The distribution of E. hyberna is stable in Ireland. Most authorities consider it to be native in Britain, although there is a possibility that it could have been introduced from Ireland. At its Cornish site it is vulnerable to the spread of more vigorous species, including Lonicera periclymenum and Rubus fruticosus, following the cessation of coppicing.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Euphorbia lathyris|A biennial of disturbed ground and waste places, including roadsides, abandoned gardens, old quarries and rubbish tips, often near human habitation; it also occurs in open woodland. The seeds are very long-lived. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|There are many more records for this species than in the 1962 Atlas. It is persistent in a few woods in S. England, and a casual or naturalised alien in other areas, originating as an escape from cultivation or from bird-seed. It is often grown in gardens as an ornamental, and has a reputation for deterring moles.|As an archaeophyte E. lathyris has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Euphorbia paralias|A deep-rooted perennial herb, thriving on free-draining mobile or semi-stable sand dunes, often in the company of E. portlandica. It also occurs along the drift-line of sandy foreshores and less frequently on shingle. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of E. paralias since the 1962 Atlas, though there have been some local losses, such as in Dorset and Devon, due to excessive disturbance of its coastal habitats.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © L. Rooney
Euphorbia peplis|An annual which grows on fine shingle or coarse sand just above the high-water mark of spring tides. Lowland.|Native|E. peplis is assumed to be extinct in Britain, the last record being from Lundy (N. Devon) in 1965, and in Ireland, where it was last recorded at Garrais Cove (Waterford) in 1839. It may also be extinct in the Channel Islands, where it was last recorded in Alderney in 1976. It is probably vulnerable to winter storm damage on Atlantic coasts. However, it could possibly recolonise from sea-borne seed derived from populations in mainland Europe.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Euphorbia peplus|An annual of cultivated, disturbed and waste ground, frequently growing close to human habitation and favouring well-drained and nutrient-rich soils in sun-warmed situations. 0-410 m in Mid-W. Yorkshire.|Archaeophyte|The distribution of this species shows no change since the 1962 Atlas. E. peplus var. minima has been recorded as a casual garden weed, brought in with garden plants from Italy.|As an archaeophyte E. peplus has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Euphorbia platyphyllos|An annual of cultivated and waste ground, usually growing on calcareous clays but sometimes on lighter chalk or limestone soils. It is found most frequently at the margins of arable fields, and occasionally on roadsides. Its seed is thought to be long-lived in the soil. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|E. platyphyllos had declined considerably prior to 1930. Many of the records from new 10-km squares since the 1962 Atlas are of single plants or small populations, and the species is still declining due to agricultural intensification.|As an archaeophyte E. platyphyllos has a European Southern-temperate distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Euphorbia portlandica|A biennial or short-lived perennial herb, growing in a wide range of coastal habitats. It occurs on cliffs, rocky slopes and steep maritime grasslands overlying many different rock types, and also on shingle and sheltered or semi-fixed sand dunes. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of E. portlandica probably changed very little during the 20th century, although it is now more comprehensively recorded than it was in the 1962 Atlas.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Euphorbia serrulata|An annual or biennial herb of open deciduous woodland, tracks and hedge banks, growing on calcareous soils and occasionally on alluvial gravels and clays. Populations tend to decline as shade and competition increase, but soil disturbance stimulates the germination of even long-buried seeds. Lowland.|Native|E. serrulata was not recorded in the wild until 1773. Its distribution has shown little change in those areas where it appears to be native, but populations have declined markedly in recent years and many now comprise fewer than twenty individuals. It has become more frequent as a garden escape since the 1962 Atlas, and these populations can be remarkably persistent.|European Southern-temperate element.
Euphrasia anglica|A diploid annual of tightly grazed habitats on damp acidic substrates. It grows in old pastures, heaths, moorlands, and disused quarries. Generally lowland, but reaching 395 m at Ystrad-ffin (Carms.).|Native|E. anglica is most distinct in S.W. England; elsewhere material can be difficult to name (Silverside, 1991). It frequently occurs in mixed populations showing introgression with a range of tetraploid species, and some of these local forms have become stabilised and show distinct ecological preferences. Because of these difficulties, the distribution is imperfectly known. It is regarded as a subspecies of E. officinalis sens. str. by Silverside (1991, 1998).|Endemic; the identification of similar plants in N. France requires confirmation (Yeo, 1978).
Euphrasia arctica||||
Euphrasia cambrica|An annual of well-drained, basic, sheep-grazed grassland on mountain slopes. More rarely it grows in wetter, base-enriched flushes where it can occur with E. rivularis. An upland species, reaching 880 m on Cadair Idris (Merioneth).|Native|E. cambrica, a tetraploid species, is easily overlooked because of its small size and inconspicuous flowers. It has been confused in the past with E. ostenfeldii, with which it forms hybrids, as at Cwm Idwal (Caerns.). Its distribution is better known than when mapped by Perring & Sell (1968).|Endemic.
Euphrasia campbelliae|An annual of damp, mossy, grazed heathy turf near the sea, in sedge-rich communities or in grassy dwarf-shrub heath, especially where Calluna vulgaris and Erica tetralix are kept short by grazing. Lowland.|Native|This tetraploid taxon was first described as a species in 1940, and is probably of complex hybrid origin. Hybrids are formed with E. confusa, E. micrantha and E. nemorosa without apparent threat to the integrity of the few known populations of the species. There is no overall change in its distribution, although there are more recent records now than when mapped by Wigginton (1999).|Endemic.
Euphrasia confusa|An annual of grazed pasture and grassy heathland on free-drained, acidic or calcareous soils. It is especially characteristic of hill pastures in N. & W. Britain, but is occasionally found in open vegetation on sandy soils elsewhere. It is rare and mainly coastal in Ireland. It can withstand intense grazing pressure. 0?660 m (Cross Fell, Cumberland).|Native|E. confusa is a widespread and frequent tetraploid species which has not changed appreciably in its distribution since it was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968), although it is now better recorded. As with other Euphrasia taxa, however, extensive hybridisation makes identification difficult and it is likely to be under-recorded.|Oceanic Boreo-temperate element.
Euphrasia foulaensis|An annual occurring in damp, open turf on coastal cliff-tops, and at the upper fringe of saltmarshes. Its cliff-top sites are subject to sea spray, but it avoids the most exposed sites. E. foulaensis seems unable to survive in rank turf, and grazing by sheep or rabbits is essential for its survival. Lowland.|Native|This tetraploid species can be locally abundant. Some sites have been lost through agricultural improvement or the cessation of grazing, but an apparent decline may rather reflect the lack of recent critical recording. However, it is much better recorded now than when mapped by Stewart et al. (1994).|Oceanic Boreal-montane element.
Euphrasia frigida|An annual of damp or wet, usually rather basic, cliff ledges. It occurs at 200 m on Foula (Shetland), but is usually found above 400 m, reaching 1190 m on Aonach Beag (Westerness).|Native|There is no evidence of any change in the distribution of this tetraploid species, although it is much better recorded than it was when mapped by Perring & Sell (1968). It is, however, almost certainly under-recorded, and is likely still to be present in many of the 10-km squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|Eurosiberian Arctic-montane element; also in N. America.
Euphrasia heslop-harrisonii|An annual largely restricted to turfy areas in saltmarshes immediately above the high water mark, where it is associated with Plantago spp. More rarely it occurs on grassy banks in the spray zone. Lowland.|Native|Though first described in 1945, this tetraploid species was poorly known until clarified by Yeo (1978). Since it was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968) it has been recorded at more sites, but may still be under-recorded. E. heslop-harrisonii is dependent on the continuation of grazing of its saltmarsh habitat.|Endemic.
Euphrasia marshallii|An annual of coastal rocks and eroding sea-cliff edges below maritime Calluna vulgaris-Empetrum nigrum heath. Plantago spp., particularly P. maritima, are constant associates and may act as hosts. Lowland.|Native|This tetraploid species was first described in 1929, and despite its relative distinctiveness, past confusion with other species and current under-recording make it difficult to assess changes in distribution. However, populations appear to be relatively stable with only limited losses through cultivation of cliff-tops. In more basic situations, E. marshallii is often replaced by its hybrid with E. nemorosa. There are many more recent records than when mapped by Wigginton (1999).|Endemic.
Euphrasia micrantha|An annual of dry or damp places on acid heaths and moorland. It also grows on open clay and sandy substrates in disturbed habitats, such as disused gravel-pits and old airfields. 0-530 m (Redburn Common, Co. Durham).|Native|This tetraploid species has declined in S.E. England, where it may now be almost extinct. Elsewhere, many apparent losses are due to under-recording or former confusion with other taxa, particularly E. scottica, and it is likely to be largely stable. Many populations show signs of hybridisation with E. nemorosa. In N.W. Scotland it is supposedly largely replaced by E. micrantha x E. scottica, but there are very few records of this hybrid.|European Temperate element.
Euphrasia nemorosa|An annual occurring in short grasslands, on heaths, downs and dunes, in open scrub, woodland rides and upland moorlands. It is absent from agriculturally improved land. 0-825 m (Cross Fell, Cumberland).|Native|This tetraploid species has not shown any marked change in its range since it was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968). It is the most common and ecologically diverse of our eyebrights, becoming more restricted to calcareous soils at low altitudes in the north. However, it forms hybrids with many other Euphrasia species, and introgressed populations can be locally abundant, making identification difficult.|European Temperate element.
Euphrasia officinalis agg.|A group of small, hemiparasitic annuals on the roots of diverse herbs and small shrubs, mainly found in permanent or semi-permanent grasslands. 0?1215 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|E. officinalis agg. includes all the Euphrasia taxa in our area. Hybridisation (sometimes involving backcrossing and the formation of locally distinct populations) and morphological plasticity mean that identification can be difficult, and comments on distributional trends for many taxa are tentative. The aggregate has declined due to habitat loss and agricultural improvement. Most taxa are under-recorded.|For the distribution of the component taxa, see the following accounts.
Euphrasia ostenfeldii|This annual occurs in sparsely vegetated areas in very well-drained, exposed habitats, including dry limestone rock ledges, eroding sea-cliffs, fine-gravel screes, bare serpentine debris and sandy coastal turf. 0-760 m (Cul Mor, W. Ross, and Helvellyn, Cumberland).|Native|Although many plants now recognised as this tetraploid species were previously referred to E. curta, the current taxonomic treatment only dates from 1971 and E. ostenfeldii is therefore under-recorded. It has also been confused with E. marshallii and E. rotundifolia, and hybrids are known with E. foulaensis. Populations from the southern end of its range (var. rupestris) may merit subspecific status.|Oceanic Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Euphrasia pseudokerneri|An annual of herb-rich downland turf on chalk and soft limestones, rarely found on harder limestones in Ireland or as forma elongata in damp fens, and recently discovered in calcareous flushes, a lead mine and coastal grassland in Cardiganshire. Lowland.|Native|E. pseudokerneri, a tetraploid, is decreasing through the ploughing up of its habitat and agricultural improvement of downland pastures. Changes in land management have favoured other Euphrasia species, particularly E. nemorosa, which may, in turn, have increased the incidence of hybridisation.|Endemic; it is replaced by E. stricta in Europe.     © L. Rooney
Euphrasia rivularis|An annual of upland rocky flushes, seepage areas and wet rock ledges on montane cliffs. It grows from 380 m at Langstrath (Westmorland) to c. 750 m on Snowdon (Caerns.).|Native|E. rivularis is diploid and is closely allied to E. rostkoviana, from which it has probably arisen through hybridisation with E. micrantha. Its distribution appears to be stable in the Lake District, but the species seems to have declined in Wales where recent searches have failed to re-find it in many known sites.|Endemic.
Euphrasia rostkoviana||||
Euphrasia rotundifolia|An annual of flushed basic turf on sea-cliffs. At its currently known sites, Primula scotica is a constant associate. Lowland.|Native|Though a re-interpretation of herbarium material has resulted in a more restrictive view of this tetraploid taxon than that adopted in Perring & Sell (1968), its taxonomic status remains uncertain. It is apparently derived through hybridisation between E. foulaensis, E. ostenfeldii and E. marshallii and is sometimes hardly distinguishable from the last, with which it regularly grows, when both are dwarfed.|Endemic.
Euphrasia salisburgensis|An annual of calcareous grasslands in karstic areas, on maritime dunes and montane limestone cliffs. 0-550 m (Ben Bulben, Co. Sligo).|Native|The distribution of this tetraploid species appears to be stable. Plants from cliffs on Ben Bulben approach the boreal species E. lapponica, but may alternatively be derived through introgression with E. frigida. Hybrids between E. salisburgensis and other Euphrasia spp. are rare, and are largely but not completely sterile. A specimen from Yorkshire collected in 1885/6 is now considered to have resulted from confusion or mislabelling in the herbarium.|European Boreo-arctic Montane element; Irish material is referable to the endemic var. hibernica.
Euphrasia scottica|An annual which is particularly associated with flush communities and wet moorland in upland areas. It is similar to E. micrantha and perhaps not specifically distinct from it (Stace, 1997). 0-915 m (Sgurr na Lappaich, Glen Strathfarrar, Easterness).|Native|The distribution of this tetraploid species is somewhat uncertain because of confusion with other taxa and hybridisation. It is certainly under-recorded. In N.W. Scotland it is supposedly largely replaced by E. micrantha x E. scottica, but there are very few records of this hybrid.|European Boreal-montane element.
Euphrasia tetraquetra|An annual of short turf on exposed coastal cliffs and sand dunes, but also locally inland on chalk and limestone pastures. Lowland.|Native|Whilst usually distinct, this tetraploid species is often confused with other Euphrasia taxa, particularly in N. Scotland where dwarf forms of E. nemorosa and E. foulaensis can be very similar. Its distribution has not changed markedly since it was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968), although it is now better recorded in some areas. Records north of W. Ross have been omitted in the absence of recently determined specimens.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Euphrasia vigursii|An annual that is characteristic of Agrostis curtisii-Ulex gallii heaths. In coastal areas it occurs mainly on cliff-tops in patches of short, species-rich turf around rock outcrops, and by tracks and paths, where scrub is suppressed but the vegetation is not too open. Inland it occurs on lightly grazed damp heaths and open moorland. Generally lowland, but reaching 330 m on Kit Hill (E. Cornwall).|Native|This diploid species has substantially declined since 1950 at its inland sites through habitat dereliction and destruction, including the decline of grazing. E. vigursii is believed to have arisen as a stabilised segregate following introgression between E. anglica and E. micrantha.|Endemic.
Exaculum pusillum|This tiny procumbent to ascending annual grows in moist, open, short turf in coastal dune-slacks. Winter-flooding and rabbit-grazing maintain the open conditions which this species requires. Lowland.|Native|This species was discovered in 1850, since when very few populations have been found. Some of the populations have apparently disappeared, but the plant persists at other sites, though its abundance varies from year to year.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Fagopyrum esculentum|An annual appearing erratically on waste ground, rubbish tips, field margins and in woodland rides. It rarely persists long at any one site. Lowland.|Neophyte|F. esculentum was recorded from the wild by 1597. Until the 19th century, it was a significant grain crop in Britain and parts of Ireland, and is still grown on a small scale for green manure, for pheasants and as a bee-plant. It sometimes occurs in sites where it is introduced with pheasant food.|An ancient crop, probably originating in S.W. China but widespread as an introduction in temperate Eurasia and elsewhere.
Fagus sylvatica|F. sylvatica is a large tree found on a wide variety of base-rich to acidic, free-draining soils. It grows in pure woodlands or as standard trees or pollards in wood pasture. It is widely planted outside its native range as woodland, in avenues and as hedges. 0-650 m S. of Garrigill (Cumberland).|Native|Beech was a late colonist of Britain after the last glacial period; it is restricted as a native to S.E. England and S.E. Wales. The native range has never been precisely defined and all records are mapped as native regardless of status. Its overall range is stable.|European Temperate element.
Fallopia convolvulus|An annual found in arable land, gardens, waste places, rubbish tips and on roadsides. 0-450 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Archaeophyte|This species has been a weed of cultivation since the Neolithic, and it was formerly the major contaminant of agricultural seed in Britain. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that the widespread decline in N. England and Scotland has occurred since 1950, possibly as marginal cultivations are abandoned.|As an archaeophyte F. convolvulus has a Eurosiberian Wide-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-temperate.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Fallopia dumetorum|A climbing annual of hedges, thickets and wood-borders on well-drained soils. Erratic in appearance, it sometimes occurs in quantity following the felling, thinning or coppicing of hedgerows and woodland. Lowland.|Native|This species has always been local in distribution. It seems to have declined since the 1962 Atlas, probably due to a lack of woodland management. In Oxfordshire, however, where it was first recorded between 1968 and 1973, it has now been found in at least 12 tetrads (Killick et al., 1998).|Eurasian Temperate element.
Fallopia japonica|A persistent rhizomatous perennial forming dense thickets on waste ground, rubbish tips, roadsides, railway banks, along canal, stream and river banks, and on sea-loch shores. Rhizome fragments are dispersed in garden and other rubbish, and by river floods. Lowland.|Neophyte|F. japonica has been grown in British gardens since 1825. It was first recorded in the wild in 1886 and became well-established between 1920 and 1940. In Ireland it was recorded as planted near Dublin in 1902. It has substantially increased since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of E. Asia; widely naturalised as a single, male-sterile clone in temperate Europe.
Fallopia sachalinensis|This robust rhizomatous perennial herb forms extensive thickets on waste ground, roadsides, river banks and lake and sea-loch shores. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Neophyte|F. sachalinensis became commercially available to British gardeners in 1869, but was much less widely planted than F. japonica because of its great size. It was naturalised in Ireland by 1896 and in Britain by 1903. It has substantially increased since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of E. Asia (Sakhalin, Japan); widely naturalised in temperate Europe.
Festuca altissima|A long-lived perennial herb of moist, wooded valleys, on rocky slopes, deciduous wood margins and streamsides, especially on seepage lines or by waterfalls. It grows on soils of a moderate base status, often with Luzula sylvatica. 0-330 m (Haweswater, Westmorland).|Native|This species grows in habitats which are sometimes virtually inaccessible, and happens to be frequent in some areas of N. England and Scotland which were not well-recorded for the 1962 Atlas. More thorough recording has revealed that it is much more frequent than previously thought.|European Temperate element.
Festuca arenaria|An extensively rhizomatous perennial found on sand dunes and open sandy shingle; also, more rarely, on cliff-tops, ledges and rough ground near the sea. On sand dunes it typically occurs on semi-mobile foredunes dominated by Ammophila arenaria or Leymus arenarius. Lowland.|Native|The map in the 1962 Atlas underestimated the distribution of this species which now includes both F. juncifolia (the taxon mapped in the 1962 Atlas) and F. rubra subsp. arenaria.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Festuca armoricana|A densely tufted perennial herb apparently restricted to fixed sand dunes at St Ouen`s and St Brelade`s Bays, Jersey. Lowland.|Native|This species, a member of the F. ovina complex, was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas. Few British botanists are familiar with it and it may have been overlooked elsewhere in the Channel Islands, and possibly also in S. England.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Festuca arundinacea|A robust perennial of scrub and woodland margins, hedgerows, pastures and meadows, river gravel, roadsides, railway banks and waste ground, on neutral or basic soils. It is also found along the banks of tidal rivers in places liable to inundation by brackish or sea water, and on slumping sea-cliffs. 0-430 m (N. of Alston, Cumberland).|Native|F. arundinacea was formerly used in seed mixtures and is only a relic of cultivation in some areas. However, it appears to have become much more frequent since the 1962 Atlas, although it may previously have been confused with F. pratensis. It can persist in swards that are infrequently mown.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Festuca filiformis|This densely tufted perennial grass occurs on heaths and moors, in open woodland and parkland and other grassy places, usually on acidic, sandy, well-drained soils. 0-1035 m (Meall Ghaordie, Mid Perth).|Native|The map in Perring & Sell (1968) was based on material seen by C. E. Hubbard or other reliable recorders. Since then F. filiformis has become more widely known, and this explains its apparent increase. There has, however, been much confusion between it and other taxa within with F. ovina species-complex (especially short-awned variants of F. ovina), and it is probably still over-recorded in some areas and overlooked in others.|Suboceanic Temperate element.
Festuca gigantea|A tufted perennial herb of moist woodland on neutral to base-rich soils, often associated with Brachypodium sylvaticum and Bromopsis ramosa. It is particularly frequent beside streams, along rides, in disturbed areas in clearings and on woodland margins, and as a colonist of secondary woodland. It is dispersed by its fruits, which adhere to fur and clothing. 0-370 m (near Nenthead, Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of F. gigantea is stable or slightly increasing.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.
Festuca huonii|A densely tufted perennial herb apparently restricted to grassy cliff-tops and ledges on acid rocks in the Channel Islands. Lowland.|Native|This member of the F. ovina complex was not recognised at the time of the 1962 Atlas. However, it is frequent within its restricted range and there are no indications of any recent change in distribution. It was reported from near Prawle Point, S. Devon, in 1992 (Takagi-Arigho, 1995). However, Stace (1997) suggests that the record `needs confirming`, and it may have been based on depauperate specimens of F. longifolia. It has not been mapped.|Oceanic Temperate element; confined to Brittany and the Channel Islands.
Festuca lemanii|A tufted perennial herb of grassy places on well-drained, acidic or calcareous soils, often occurring with F. ovina. It is characteristic of limestone cliff rock crevices in Derbyshire. Lowland.|Native|or alien. This species was not separately mapped in the 1962 Atlas. At that time, F. lemanii and F. brevipila were collectively known by the misapplied name `F. longifolia`, and there continues to be much confusion between F. lemanii and other taxa within the F. ovina species-complex, including F. ovina itself. It is little known to British botanists, can easily be overlooked and is probably much under-recorded.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Festuca longifolia|A densely tufted perennial herb occurring on dry, rabbit-grazed heaths, sandy roadside banks and, in S. Devon and the Channel Islands, on maritime cliff-tops and ledges. Lowland.|Native|Past confusion between F. longifolia and other glaucous taxa of Festuca, and a consequent lack of reliable historical data, means that changes in distribution remain unclear. Several colonies in Breckland have been lost since the early 1980s. Most surviving populations there, and in Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, are small and at risk of being ousted by rank grass or shaded out by trees. Coastal populations are less threatened.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Festuca ovina|This morphologically variable, densely tufted perennial herb occurs in a wide range of unproductive, usually well-drained grassy habitats, including lowland calcareous grasslands, upland heaths and moors, mountain slopes and rock ledges, and sea-cliffs. 0-1305 m (Ben Macdui, S. Aberdeen).|Native|The distribution of F. ovina is stable, but it is very unevenly recorded. The map shows records of the species and its three component subspecies. This grass is of enormous agricultural and socio-economic importance, being one of the predominant constituents of hill pastures across great swathes of upland Britain and Ireland.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Festuca ovina agg.|These perennial herbs grow in a variety of well-drained acidic and basic, usually infertile, habitats, including open woodland, grasslands, sand dunes, upland heaths and moors, rock ledges and sea-cliffs. Some segregates are common in grass-seed mixtures. 0?1305 m (Ben Macdui, S. Aberdeen).|Native|The distribution of F. ovina agg. is stable. All eight species forming this aggregate are mapped separately. Some of these are poorly known and many botanists continue to record only F. ovina agg.|This aggregate includes F. vivipara and a complex of other taxa which have a Eurasian Boreo-temperate distribution but have been widely introduced elsewhere.
Festuca pratensis|A short-lived perennial found in a wide range of neutral grasslands, usually on fertile soils, including pastures, hay- and water-meadows. It is often sown for fodder and has become naturalised on roadsides, railway banks and waste ground. 0?575 m (Hartside, Cumberland) and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|The native distribution of F. pratensis has been obscured by sowing, and it may only occur in N. & W. Britain and W. Ireland as a relic of cultivation. It may be decreasing due to the loss of wet meadows and a decline in its popularity in grass mixtures.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.
Festuca pratensis x Lolium perenne (x Festulolium loliaceum)|This rather variable hybrid occurs in pastures and meadows, in marshy grassland beside rivers and ponds, and on waysides. It usually grows on damp, fertile, rather heavy soils. Generally lowland, but reaching 470 m at Tyne Head (Cumberland).|Native|This is the most widespread of the Festuca x Lolium hybrids, and is certainly more frequent than the map in Perring & Sell (1968) suggests. It is probably still under-recorded, but it may sometimes have been recorded erroneously for other X Festulolium hybrids or even for variants of L. perenne. It is unclear whether the absence of recent records in many squares reflects a lack of recording or a genuine decline.|Widespread in temperate Europe.     © L. Rooney
Festuca rubra||||
Festuca rubra agg.|These extremely variable tufted or rhizomatous perennials are found in all kinds of grassy habitats, including lowland meadows and pastures, saltmarshes, sea-cliffs, sand dunes, hill grasslands, mountain slopes and rock ledges. 0?1080 m (Snowdon, Caerns.).|Native|There has been little change in the range of this ubiquitous taxon since the 1962 Atlas. F. rubra sens. lat. includes F. arenaria and F. rubra, the latter divided into seven subspecies. Of these, F. rubra subsp. rubra occurs throughout the range of the species. The other taxa are mapped separately.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Festuca vivipara|A tufted perennial herb of upland heathy pastures, open Betula and Quercus woodland, rock ledges and crevices, and a wide range of mountain slope and plateau communities including areas of late snow-lie; also found in the drier parts of bogs and on stream banks. It grows on both basic and acidic substrates. From sea level in W. Scotland and Ireland, to 1215 m on Ben Macdui (S. Aberdeen).|Native|The range of F. vivipara has remained stable since the 1962 Atlas, but it is now better recorded in England and Wales.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Filago gallica|An annual of well-drained, sandy and gravelly soils in open, disturbed sites such as arable field margins, grassy banks, gravel-pits and quarries, tracks and roadsides. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|F. gallica, first recorded in Britain in 1696, was known from at least thirty sites in S.E. England. In the late 19th and 20th centuries changing agricultural practices and reduced rabbit disturbance led to its extinction in 1955. It was re-introduced to its last known site in Essex in 1994 using local seed, and has been deliberately planted in Suffolk. It survives on Sark (Channel Islands).|F. gallica is native of the Mediterranean region; it is probably introduced in the northern part of its Submediterranean-Subatlantic range.
Filago lutescens|A winter- or spring- annual of dry, open, sandy or gravelly acidic to neutral soils such as the edges of arable fields, tracks, sand-pits, heaths and commons, and particularly characteristic of rabbit scrapes. Populations can vary greatly in size annually. Lowland.|Native|First recorded in 1846, there was a dramatic decline in F. lutescens after the 1950s, attributable to habitat loss, the reduction of the rabbit population and changing agricultural practices. Since 1993 there has been a sharp increase in the number of records due to special surveys and conservation management.|As a possible native, F. lutescens has a European Temperate distribution.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Filago minima|An annual of dry, open, infertile, acidic to neutral soils in a wide range of habitats, including arable fields, open grassland, quarries and mine spoil, woodland tracks, sandy heaths, sand-pits and dunes. 0-365 m (Rannoch, Mid Perth).|Native|F. minima is nowhere particularly frequent, and like all species of Filago, is in continuing slow decline across much of its British and Irish range.|European Temperate element; it reaches its northern limit in Scotland.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Filago pyramidata|An annual of well-drained soils usually kept open through drought or disturbance. Formerly, it was most frequent as a weed of arable land on calcareous or acidic sandy soils, but most remaining sites are in chalk quarries or on chalk spoil. Populations vary greatly in size annually. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|This species has suffered a major decline which is most probably attributable to changing agricultural practices, such as autumn cereal growing and the increasing use of herbicides.|As an archaeophyte F. pyramidata has a Submediterranean-Subatlantic distribution. It reaches its northern limit in England, and is declining in the eastern part of its European range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Filago vulgaris|An autumn- or spring-germinating annual of dry, open, acidic to neutral and occasionally calcareous habitats including open grassland, quarries and rocky ledges, sand-pits and dunes, sandy heaths and tracks, and arable and other cultivated ground. Lowland.|Native|Populations of F. vulgaris may fluctuate in size in response to climatic conditions and disturbance, but overall there has been a progressive decline, very marked in S. and W. England and Ireland, largely as a result of changing agricultural practices and the cultivation of marginal land.|European Southern-temperate element; also recorded in C. Asia. It reaches its northern limit in Scotland and Jutland.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Filipendula ulmaria|A perennial herb of damp or wet habitats, on moderately fertile, neutral or calcareous substrates; it is characteristic of sites where water levels fluctuate and is absent from permanently waterlogged ground. Typical habitats include wet woodland, damp meadows, swamps and tall-herb fens, damp roadsides, ditches and railway banks, and montane tall-herb communities. It also occasionally grows in somewhat drier conditions, such as N.-facing chalk grassland. It is intolerant of grazing and rarely flowers in shade. 0-880 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of F. ulmaria is stable.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Filipendula vulgaris|A perennial herb, mainly occurring in calcareous grassland on chalk and limestone downs, and in rough pasture; also found on coastal and inland heaths over limestone, chalk and other basic rocks, including serpentine. It is frequently planted in churchyards in W. Wales. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m in N.E. Yorks.|Native|F. vulgaris has declined in its chalk habitats in S. England because of the lack of grazing or conversion of grassland to arable, but the distribution seems unchanged elsewhere. It is grown in gardens, sometimes escaping and becoming naturalised. Deciding whether populations are native or alien is difficult in some areas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Foeniculum vulgare|A perennial herb found in marshes, on sea-walls, in gravel-pits, on roadsides and waste ground and on rubbish tips. It has a deep tap-root, allowing it to survive in droughted habitats and making it very persistent. It reproduces freely from seed. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Archaeological evidence suggests that F. vulgare has been used as a culinary herb since Roman times. It is common in gardens, but rarely cultivated on a field scale. It is much more frequent now than when mapped in the 1962 Atlas, especially inland.|Subsp. piperitum is native to the Mediterranean region; our plant is subsp. vulgare which was derived from it in cultivation and is widely naturalised in Europe and elsewhere.
Fragaria vesca|A perennial stoloniferous herb of dry, sometimes stony, soils in woodland and scrub, on hedge banks, railway banks and roadsides and on basic rock outcrops and screes in upland areas. It also colonises open ground in quarries and chalk-pits, and grows on walls. It reproduces by seed, and spreads by rooting stolons. 0-640 m (Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|The map suggests that there may have been a decline in the frequency of F. vesca since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; also in N. America and widely naturalised outside its native range.
Fragaria x ananassa|A perennial stoloniferous herb, widely naturalised on railway banks and in waste places, and a casual on rubbish tips. It usually grows as a naturalised plant on deeper soils than F. vesca. Lowland.|Neophyte|This commonly cultivated hybrid has been grown in Britain since 1806 and is a frequent escape from gardens or fruit farms, or arises from discarded or bird-sown fruits. Early records were confused with F. moschata, but it was certainly present in the wild by 1900. There are many more records than in the 1962 Atlas, probably due to both a genuine increase in the wild and improved recording of aliens.|A hybrid between two American species, developed in France in the 18th century.
Frangula alnus|This deciduous shrub or small tree grows on a wide range of soils, but avoids drought-prone and permanently waterlogged sites. It is found in scrub on fen peat, on the edges of raised mires, on heaths and in valley mires, in scrub, hedgerows and in woodland. It regenerates strongly after cutting, burning or grazing. Generally lowland, but reaching 450 m at The Arch (Cards.).|Native|This species was formerly planted for charcoal production, and this may have blurred its native distribution in some areas. Its overall distribution is stable, but there have been some losses since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Frankenia laevis|A mat-forming perennial herb of saltmarshes and saltmarsh-sand dune transitions, especially where firm sand or silt overlies coarser grained material; also rarely on shingle beaches and chalk sea-cliffs. Lowland.|Native|F. laevis has declined in E. England due to disturbance of saltmarshes and their destruction through improvement of sea defences, urbanisation and industrial development, but these losses, at a 10-km scale, were largely before 1930. It is sometimes grown on rock gardens, and this is probably the origin of the recently discovered sites in S.W. England and Wales.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Fraxinus excelsior|A deciduous tree of woodland, scrub and hedgerows, especially on moist, basic soils, but also frequent on rock scars and cliffs, stabilised scree and the grikes of limestone pavement. It can tolerate periodically waterlogged soils, being found around springs and in Alnus and Salix carr. In managed woodland it may be grown as a timber tree or coppice. It is a rapid coloniser of waste ground, disused quarries and railway banks. 0-585 m (Cwm Idwal, Caerns.).|Native|The range of F. excelsior is stable. In N. Scotland it is native on limestone and widely planted elsewhere; differentiating native from alien populations can be difficult.|European Temperate element.
Fritillaria meleagris|A bulbous perennial herb of damp, sometimes winter-flooded, neutral grasslands, usually those managed for hay with aftermath grazing. It is frequently planted in other grassland habitats and sometimes becomes naturalised. Lowland.|Native|This species was cultivated in Britain by 1578 but only found in the wild in 1736; it has never been clear whether populations in traditionally managed floodplain meadows in C. and S.E. England are native. Many such populations have been lost through habitat destruction. Much of the decline, however, had occurred by the time of the 1962 Atlas, and losses since then have been limited by protection.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Fuchsia magellanica|A spreading shrub, principally found as a planted hedge or in the gardens of abandoned cottages but also naturalised in hedgerows, scrub, by streams and amongst rocks and on walls. Reproduction is by suckering. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Neophyte|F. magellanica was introduced to our area in 1788 and first recorded from the wild in 1857. Nearly all the hedges in W. Britain and Ireland are the cultivar `Riccartonii`, which apparently arose in a Scottish nursery before 1850 and is sterile. Other taxa occur, but their taxonomy has yet to be elucidated.|Native of S. America (Argentina, Chile).
Fumaria bastardii|A scrambling annual of arable and horticultural land and, more rarely, hedge banks, usually growing on freely-draining, acidic soils. Probably mainly spring-germinating, it is typically found in spring-sown crops. Lowland.|Native|In contrast to many other less common arable species, its distribution has changed little. It usually occurs mixed with other large-flowered Fumaria species, and can be difficult to distinguish from F. muralis. It is under-recorded in some areas of Ireland where recorders have been unable to distinguish these two species.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Fumaria capreolata|A scrambling annual of open scrub, hedge banks and cliffs, and only occasionally found in arable land and gardens. Unlike most other species of Fumaria, it can be a winter-annual. Lowland.|Native|The endemic subsp. babingtonii is the widespread segregate, with the continental subsp. capreolata apparently confined to the Channel Islands. F. capreolata has declined in its inland sites, where it may only have been casual, but the distribution is stable on or near the coast.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Fumaria densiflora|A scrambling annual of arable land. It is most frequently found on chalk but can also occur on other freely-draining soils. It normally grows in species-rich communities, often with other species of Fumaria, and is most commonly found in spring-sown cereals and root crops. It has a long-lived seed bank, and germination is mainly in the spring. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Like many other species of arable land, F. densiflora has become less frequent as a result of agricultural intensification, and is increasingly found in vegetable rather than cereal crops. It was last recorded in N. Ireland in 1946.|As an archaeophyte F. densiflora has a European Southern-temperate distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Fumaria muralis|An annual, scrambling herb of arable land, gardens and hedge banks on freely-draining, acidic soils. Lowland.|Native|F. muralis is the most common of the large-flowered Fumaria species. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, and greatly under-recorded. It may have become less common in arable habitats in recent years. Three subspecies have been described in our area, but these are taxonomically very close, and indeed the species itself can be difficult to separate from F. bastardii and F. reuteri.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Fumaria occidentalis|A scrambling annual of freely-draining, base-poor substrates, found in a range of habitats including field margins, hedge banks, road verges, waste ground and cultivated land. Lowland.|Native|F. occidentalis can be irregular in appearance, but on the mainland is thought to be spreading as a colonist of waste ground. In contrast, it has apparently suffered a sharp decline since 1970 in bulb-fields in the Isles of Scilly.|Endemic.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Fumaria officinalis|A scrambling annual of arable fields, allotments, gardens and other disturbed land, most commonly found on calcareous soils. Most germination occurs in the spring, and the seed bank is long-lived. Lowland, reaching 305 m near Shap quarries (Westmorland).|Archaeophyte|F. officinalis was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas; its overall distribution at the 10-km scale is stable. Subsp. officinalis occurs throughout the range of the species while subsp. wirtgenii is most frequent on light soils in the east.|As an archaeophyte F. officinalis has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © P. Shannon
Fumaria parviflora|This scrambling annual is almost exclusively found in arable fields on chalky soils, though may occasionally be found on other areas of disturbed ground near arable populations. It is usually associated with other uncommon arable species and, like the other small-flowered Fumaria species, is generally found in spring-sown crops. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|F. parviflora has never been very frequent, but has declined since the Second World War as a result of agricultural intensification. It is now increasingly restricted to field margins.|European Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Fumaria purpurea|F. purpurea is a scrambling annual of hedge banks, earth-core walls, arable land and gardens on acidic, freely-draining soils, usually most abundant in disturbed places, or in habitats opened up by summer drought. Most occurrences are in spring-sown crops, although in the Isles of Scilly it is found in bulb-fields. Lowland.|Native|This species is erratic in its appearance at some sites, and is probably unfamiliar to many recorders. Trends in its distribution are therefore difficult to ascertain, but it seems to be stable in its core areas. Elsewhere it may be declining or overlooked, and at some sites it may have only been casual.|Endemic.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Fumaria reuteri|F. reuteri is a scrambling annual of freely-draining acidic soils, which has most recently been recorded in spring- and summer-sown crops on allotments, in gardens and in potato fields; also on the eroded soil of hedge banks. Lowland.|Neophyte|First recorded in 1904, this species has been reported from only two areas since 1980, and appears to be in sharp decline at one of these, in Cornwall, as formerly cultivated land reverts to grassland. It can be very difficult to distinguish from F. muralis.|An Oceanic Southern-temperate species.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Fumaria vaillantii|This scrambling annual is almost exclusively found in arable fields on chalky soils, and is usually associated with other uncommon arable species.

Gagea bohemica|A bulbous perennial herb growing in shallow pockets of soil in crevices, on ledges and in small, grazed patches of turf on S.- and E.-facing slopes overlying dolerite. Between 210 and 330 m at Stanner Rocks (Rads.).|Native|G. bohemica rarely flowers in Britain, reproducing almost exclusively by bulbils. This, coupled with its very early flowering season and a long summer dormancy, led to the species remaining undetected until 1965 (and unrecognised as G. bohemica until 1975). However, the population is large and apparently stable.|European Southern-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Gagea lutea|A bulbous perennial herb of moist, base-rich, shady habitats including woods, hedgerows, limestone pavements, pastures, riverbanks and stream banks; sometimes washed down on alluvium in riverine woodland subject to seasonal flooding. Mainly lowland, but to 340 m near Ribblehead (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|G. lutea is often shy-flowering, especially in its shadier localities, and many populations are small and widely scattered. These factors undoubtedly led to it being under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas. It is, therefore, difficult to assess trends, but the overall distribution appears to be relatively stable.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; also in C. and E. Asia.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Galanthus nivalis|A bulbous perennial herb of moist woodlands and other shaded places. It is especially frequent in parks, large gardens and churchyards, but also occurs on road verges, by watercourses and in damp grassland. Spread is mainly by division of the bulbs, as seed production is poor. 0-370 m (Nenthall, Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species was known in cultivation in Britain in 1597 but was not recorded in the wild until 1778. Although it was formerly sometimes regarded as native, it is now considered to be alien. It was probably under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas, and there is little reason to suspect a real change in its distribution.|A European Southern-temperate species; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Galega officinalis|A perennial herb of waste places, gravel pits, roadsides, railway banks and rubbish tips. Lowland.|Neophyte|Though introduced into cultivation by 1568, and first recorded in the wild in 1640, the spread of this species is very recent. It was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas, yet in parts of London is now found in 75% of the tetrads in each 10-km square. To date, it has predominantly been an urban plant, but it is now spreading into rural areas. Many garden forms are hybrids between G. officinalis and G. patula (G. x hartlandii) and it is probable that many records refer to this taxon.|A European Temperate species, absent as a native from much of W. Europe.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Galeopsis angustifolia|An annual of arable land, waste places and open ground on calcareous substrates, including limestone pavements and scree; also found on eskers and on coastal sand and shingle. This late-flowering species often fails to set seed within winter-sown crops. 0-320 m (Derbys.).|Archaeophyte|G. angustifolia was formerly a common cornfield weed in some areas (Druce, 1927), but the contraction in range shown in the 1962 Atlas has accelerated following a shift from spring- to winter-sown crops and cleaner crop husbandry. It is increasing on ground disturbed by gravel extraction in Ireland.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Galeopsis bifida|An annual of arable, waste and cultivated ground, and less often woodland clearings and ditch-sides. It is found in similar places to G. tetrahit, and often grows with it, although more strictly an arable weed. Lowland.|Native|G. bifida was mapped within G. tetrahit sens. lat. in the 1962 Atlas. As a consequence there is no basis from which to assess any changes in distribution. It is almost certainly under-recorded.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.
Galeopsis segetum|An annual weed of arable and waste ground, most frequently found as a casual in root-crops. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|This species was formerly established at one site near Bangor (Caerns.). Although it used to appear annually after its discovery there in 1802, it has been seen only once since the 1962 Atlas (in 1975) and is now presumed to be extinct. It has often been regarded as a native at this locality. Elsewhere it is a rare and declining casual.|As an archaeophyte G. segetum has a Suboceanic Temperate distribution.
Galeopsis speciosa|An annual weed of cultivated, marginal and waste ground, often within root-crops (especially potatoes) on peaty soils. 0-445 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Archaeophyte|This species has declined markedly since the 1962 Atlas. It is often associated with traditional arable farming and has suffered where modern methods of cultivation and weed control have been introduced.|As an archaeophyte G. speciosa has a Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Galeopsis tetrahit|An annual of habitats such as woodland clearings, ditches, fens, river banks, roadside verges and wet heaths, but perhaps more frequent in disturbed arable, waste and cultivated ground. 0?450 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Native|G. tetrahit sens. str. has not previously been mapped at a national level. It is clear from the map that in some areas recorders have not distinguished it from G. bifida.|European Boreo-temperate element.
Galeopsis tetrahit agg.|These annuals grow in moist, moderately shaded semi-natural habitats such as woodland clearings, ditches, fens, river banks, roadside verges and wet heaths, but perhaps more frequently in disturbed arable, waste and cultivated ground. 0?445 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Native|Records of G. bifida and G. tetrahit are included on this map, which is equivalent to the map of G. tetrahit sens. lat. in the 1962 Atlas.|The world distribution of the two segregates is given in the following accounts.
Galinsoga parviflora|An annual weed of light soils in cultivated fields, nursery plots, garden centres and gardens, and in waste ground in urban areas. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was introduced as a garden plant to Kew Gardens by 1796, from where it had escaped by 1860 (and was known as `Kew Weed`). It has spread steadily since then, aided by transport from nursery gardens and occurring also as a wool alien. It is widespread as a casual, sometimes persisting, and has certainly undergone a considerable expansion of range and frequency since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of S. America; widely naturalised in other countries.
Galinsoga quadriradiata|An annual of arable fields, waste ground, roadsides and rubbish tips, derelict urban sites and cracks in pavements, most often occurring in the larger conurbations. Lowland.|Neophyte|The species was first recorded from the wild in 1909 (Middlesex), perhaps being originally introduced with ornamental garden plants, though it is also a bird-seed alien. Early on, it may have been mistaken for G. parviflora, and there were records from only nine 10-km squares by 1940. In the 1962 Atlas it was present in 98 10-km squares, and it has increased considerably since then. It was first recorded in Ireland in 1980.|Native of C. & S. America; widely naturalised in Europe and elsewhere.
Galium aparine|A scrambling annual of cultivated land, hedges, river banks, waysides, soil heaps and waste places, also growing in more natural habitats such as scree slopes and shingle. It inhabits both tall-herb and ruderal communities, thriving on highly fertile soil. Seed is dispersed by mammals. 0-440 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Native|The overall distribution of G. aparine is stable. It is a highly successful and abundant weed, especially in arable crops, and is probably increasing in abundance despite the use of species-specific agricultural herbicides.|European Temperate element, but widely naturalised so distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.
Galium boreale|A perennial herb of damp, usually base-enriched substrates, occurring in rocky places, on mountain ledges and screes, in base-rich flushes in montane grassland, on river shingle and stony lake shores, and on stabilised sand dunes. 0-1065 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of this species is little changed in Scotland, but it seems to have declined in England, particularly since 1970, where increased grazing pressure may be causing losses (Halliday, 1997). It is better recorded now than it was for the 1962 Atlas, especially in N. Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Galium constrictum|A perennial herb found around the margins of ponds which dry out in summer, on New Forest `lawns` and in track ruts, and locally in marl-pits and ditches in water-meadows. Lowland.|Native|The many new records for G. constrictum in recent years probably result from a genuine increase in the number of sites as well as greater recording effort. New Forest (S. Hants.) populations seem reasonably secure as long as current management practices continue. It was last seen in Devon in 1972. The record from Yorkshire shown in the 1962 Atlas is considered to be an error.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Galium mollugo|A stoloniferous perennial herb of well-drained, calcareous or base-rich soils. Habitats include rough and permanent grassland, waysides, railway banks, roadsides, hedge banks, woodland edges, scrub and waste ground. 0?845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|G. mollugo shows little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas, although it is now much better recorded, especially in Wales. It is common in wild-flower seed mixtures, and may be increasing on roadsides. It is regarded as alien in Ireland (Scannell & Synnott, 1987). Two subspecies may occur in our area (subsp. mollugo and subsp. erectum) but their taxonomic status is uncertain.|European Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P.

Galium odoratum|A rhizomatous perennial herb which grows in deciduous woodland, scrub and shaded hedge banks on base-rich or neutral, often damp, soils. This species is thought to be a good indicator of ancient woodlands in lowland England. 0-640 m (Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|G. odoratum was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined as older woodlands have been removed or replanted with conifers, especially in East Anglia and S.E. England, but it remains frequent and locally abundant across much of its range. It is sometimes grown in gardens and some records near habitation may be escapes.|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Galium palustre|A perennial herb of seasonal or permanently wetland habitats, including wet meadows, marshes, fens, ditches, ponds and lakesides. It grows on a wide range of soil types, but has a preference for non-calcareous substrates. 0-825 m (Cross Fell, Cumberland).|Native|Despite widespread destruction of wetlands, there is no evidence to suggest a change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, perhaps due to its ability to colonise new standing water habitats. Two subspecies (subsp. palustre and subsp. elongatum) occur in our area throughout the range of the species, but have not been recorded evenly.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.
Galium parisiense|An annual of old walls and bare ground on calcareous or neutral substrates. It is intolerant of competition, and is susceptible to nutrient-enrichment. It may occasionally occur as a casual or short-term introduction well outside its normal range. Lowland.|Native|G. parisiense was first recorded in Britain in 1690. Always scarce, and lost from many 10-km squares before 1930, it has undergone further decline since the 1962 Atlas as many of the open, infertile soils on which it grew have undergone agricultural improvement and ancient walls have been cleaned, re-built or demolished.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Galium pumilum|A perennial herb of species-rich chalk and limestone grassland where the sward is kept short by grazing, mowing, exposure or disturbance, and on anthills. It also grows on limestone spoil-heaps. 0-375 m (near Pitlochry, E. Perth).|Native|Old records of G. pumilum are unreliable as the species was previously confused with G. sterneri, so changes in its distribution are difficult to assess. However, confirmed specimens exist from many sites where this species now appears to be absent, the loss of chalk grassland and reduced grazing probably accounting for any decline. Plants at Cheddar (N. Somerset) formerly referred to G. fleurotii are now included within G. pumilum.|European Temperate element.
Galium saxatile|A low-growing perennial herb of infertile acidic soils, occurring in grassland, on heaths, in rocky places and open woods, and locally on disturbed or derelict ground. 0-1215 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|This species remains abundant in upland areas, and is a useful indicator of unimproved hill grassland. However, it has declined locally in the lowlands as a result of habitat destruction.|Suboceanic Temperate element.
Galium spurium|An annual, formerly occurring as an arable weed on autumn-cultivated land, particularly in cereal and potato crops, but in recent years known only from a few allotments and nearby roadside verges. It may occasionally arise from a residual seed bank during roadworks. It flowers in autumn. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was first recorded in the wild in 1806 and has been known from around Saffron Walden (N. Essex) since 1844, although it is now much rarer than it was when first discovered. It has only been recorded as a casual elsewhere.|Circumpolar Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; the limits of its native range have been obscured by its spread in cultivation.
Galium sterneri|A perennial herb of short grassland overlying limestone and basic igneous rocks and mica-schist, also growing on vegetated scree slopes, rock ledges and limestone pavement. Lowland to 975 m on Creag Mhor (Mid Perth).|Native|G. sterneri is much better recorded now than for the 1962 Atlas. Populations in rocky, upland habitats are probably stable, whilst it may have declined in limestone grassland because of agricultural improvement or the lack of grazing.|Suboceanic Boreal-montane element.
Galium tricornutum|An annual of cereal fields and disturbed ground, chiefly on dry calcareous soils. Rarely, it can arise as a casual from the seed bank during earth-moving. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|The very substantial decline, already apparent by 1930, has continued since the 1962 Atlas, due to the intensification of arable farming. Populations are usually very small, and large ones tend to be transient. Re-introduction into protected sites is occasionally attempted using seed of English origin.|As an archaeophyte G. tricornutum has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution.
Galium uliginosum|A perennial herb of base-rich marshes and fens, usually in drier and more calcareous habitats than G. palustre, although the two may sometimes be found growing together. 0-750 m (Cross Fell, Cumberland).|Native|G. uliginosum has tended to be over-recorded in the past; in particular all records from N.W. Scotland are treated as doubtful and are not mapped. Some other early records may also be errors for G. palustre. Even allowing for this, analysis of the database reveals a widespread decline in this species since 1950. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Galium verum|A stoloniferous perennial herb of well-drained, relatively infertile neutral or calcareous soils. Habitats include hay meadows, pastures, chalk and limestone downland, rock outcrops, quarries, coastal cliff-tops, dune grasslands and machair, roadsides and railway embankments. Procumbent plants (var. maritimum) occur widely in coastal habitats. 0-780 m (Coire na Gabhar, Mid Perth).|Native|Although it has declined locally as a result of grassland improvement, G. verum remains common across much of its range. It is a frequent constituent of wild-flower seed mixtures.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Gastridium ventricosum|An annual of well-drained grasslands on calcareous substrates, especially on S.-facing slopes where the turf is broken by patches of crumbling soil. It used to be a frequent weed of cornfields, and is an occasional wool and grain casual. Lowland.|Native|G. ventricosum was first recorded in 1690 and is possibly native in grassland in S.W. Britain and in the Channel Islands, where it has been found to be much more widespread than shown in the 1962 Atlas. Formerly it was regarded as an arable weed, but it had largely vanished from such habitats by 1930. As habitat details are not available for many old records, they are mapped as if they are native.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Gaudinia fragilis|An annual or short-lived perennial herb of meadows, pastures and waysides on calcareous clay soils; also an occasional casual around docks and on tips. Lowland.|Native|or alien. G. fragilis was cultivated in Britain by 1770 and was first recorded in the wild in 1903. It appears to have increased since 1980, though many new records are of well-established populations that must have been previously overlooked. It has a strikingly similar distribution to Oenanthe pimpinelloides and this, together with its preference for old meadows, has led some to consider that it might be native, at least in its core areas. Alternatively, it may have been introduced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with grass seed imported from S. Europe.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Gaultheria shallon|A low shrub, locally naturalised in woodland and open heathland on acidic, sandy and peaty soils. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m at Tosson (S. Northumb.).|Neophyte|G. shallon was introduced into cultivation in Britain in 1826, and has been recorded in the wild since 1914. It was originally planted as cover for game birds, but has locally become a serious pest, especially on lowland heath where it regenerates rapidly after clearance. In the New Forest (S. Hants.) pigs penned in infested areas have proved effective in uprooting it.|Native of western N. America.
Genista anglica|A small spiny shrub, found in the lowlands on relatively humid grass heaths and around the drier fringes of bogs. In upland areas it occurs in heathy, damp, unimproved pastures. Predominantly lowland but reaching 730 m in Atholl (E. Perth).|Native|Away from the New Forest (S. Hants.), with its long continuity of grazing, there has been a very substantial decline of this species in England and S. Scotland. The inherent fertility of many of its heathland sites means that they are frequently vulnerable to agricultural improvement, or else are apt to be become quickly overgrown following cessation of grazing or other management.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © Pete Stroh
Genista pilosa|A low, usually prostrate, shrub growing mainly on rocky cliff-tops in maritime grassland or heath. It also grows in limestone grassland in Brecon, on rock ledges in the Cadair Idris range, and formerly on dry heaths in S. England. Generally lowland, but reaching 710 m on Cadair Idris (Merioneth).|Native|All G. pilosa sites on inland heaths have been lost through agricultural improvement or lack of management. The Breckland populations had become extinct by 1866 but the last inland site, in Sussex, survived until 1977 or perhaps 1980. Elsewhere, the distribution and populations seem stable.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Genista tinctoria|A small deciduous shrub of rough pastures, old meadows, grassy heaths, cliffs, road verges and field edges on heavy soils, usually calcareous to slightly acidic clays. Lowland.|Native|This species has declined considerably since the 1940s through the loss of old pastures, and is now a rare sight in some counties. Subsp. tinctoria occurs throughout the range of the species; subsp. littoralis is mapped separately.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Gentiana nivalis|G. nivalis is an annual or biennial herb of calcareous soils, most populations occurring in grazed herb-rich grassland. It is found on rock ledges, vegetated screes and adjacent slopes. Montane, from 730 m to 1095 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|Populations of this species vary greatly in numbers from year to year, but seem stable in the longer term. Current high levels of grazing cause the loss of many plants, but this may mostly be offset by the corresponding control of competitors and the creation of new ground for seedlings. This species is one of very few annuals in the British Arctic-montane flora.|European Arctic-montane element; also in N. America.
Gentiana pneumonanthe|A long-lived perennial herb of damp acidic grassland and wet heaths, usually on relatively enriched soils, and often where there is seasonal movement of surface water. The opening up of the habitat by grazing or occasional light burning favours this species by promoting flowering. Lowland.|Native|This species was already declining by the 1930s and the map in the 1962 Atlas included many local extinctions, due largely to drainage, development or neglect of its sites. This decline has continued to the present day.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Gentiana verna|A perennial herb of open, often stony, limestone grassland and calcareous glacial drift. It is also found on hummocks in calcareous flush communities, and in Ireland also on limestone pavement and fixed dunes. Upland in England, ascending from about 350 m to c. 730 m on Little Fell (Westmorland), but lowland in Ireland on the Burren (Co. Clare) down to near sea level.|Native|There has been no appreciable change in distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, but numbers have declined, particularly in outlying populations. Overgrazing in the uplands is a continuing threat to this species in Britain.|European Arctic-montane element; also in C. Asia.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Gentianella amarella|An annual or biennial herb of well-drained basic soils, typically occurring in grazed chalk and limestone grassland, on calcareous dunes and machair, on spoil-tips and in cuttings and quarries. Mainly lowland, ascending to 750 m (Knock Fell, Westmorland).|Native|There is some evidence of a decline in this species since the 1962 Atlas. In Ireland only subsp. hibernica has been recorded; subsp. amarella is widespread in Britain north to C. Scotland, and subsp. septentrionalis is mapped separately. G. amarella hybridises freely with G. anglica and G. uliginosa. However, recent molecular research suggests that the boundaries between these taxa are not clear-cut.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Gentianella anglica|An annual or biennial herb of shallow calcareous soils, especially on the chalk, in closely grazed calcareous grassland, quarries, on cliff-tops and sand dunes. Lowland.|Native|Since the 1962 Atlas, many populations of G. anglica have declined or been lost, largely due to reduced grazing. Recently, however, some new sites have been found as a result of intensive surveys. The hybrid between G. anglica and G. amarella (G. x davidiana), previously described as G. anglica subsp. cornubiensis, has been reported from S. England. However, preliminary genetic analysis suggests that distinctions between G. anglica, G. amarella and the hybrid can no longer be supported (Winfield & Parker, 2000).|Endemic.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Gentianella campestris|A biennial, occasionally annual, herb of mildly acidic to neutral soils in a variety of open habitats, including pastures, hill grassland, grassy heaths, sand dunes, machair and road verges. On limestone it probably indicates surface leaching or the presence of non-calcareous superficial deposits. Generally lowland, but reaching 915 m at Cairnwell (E. Perth, S. Aberdeen).|Native|G. campestris had already suffered a marked decline before 1930 and sites are still being lost through overgrazing in the uplands and the neglect of lowland pastures. In its English stronghold, Cumbria, it has disappeared from half the 10-km squares for which there are post-1930 records.|European Boreo-temperate element.     © Pete Stroh
Gentianella ciliata|A biennial, or perhaps annual, herb of chalk grassland, growing in shortly-grazed, herb-rich turf on a steep W.-facing slope. Lowland.|Native|or alien. Although first reported as G. ciliata from Wendover (Bucks.) in 1875, these plants were subsequently dismissed as Campanula glomerata until the species was re-discovered, in perhaps the same field, in 1982. This, the only known extant population, is variable in size, reaching a peak in the late 1980s but since declining to almost none. Recent study of herbarium specimens has revealed previously unknown collections from Wiltshire (1892) and Surrey (1910), the latter being considered an alien.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Gentianella germanica|An annual or biennial herb of shallow chalk soils, occurring in chalk grassland (frequently near tracks) and chalk-pits, and sometimes in open scrub and on woodland margins. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of this species has not changed significantly since the 1962 Atlas. There have, however, been some local losses, and populations vary in size from year to year depending on weather and disturbance. G. amarella often accompanies this species, and hybrids (G. x pamplinii) frequently occur, with back-crossing to G. amarella. Hybridisation has been implicated in the loss of some populations of G. germanica.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Gentianella uliginosa|An annual of coastal dunes, dune-slacks and machair, usually in open ground or short vegetation maintained by grazing, disturbance or winter flooding. Lowland.|Native|Since the 1962 Atlas, populations have been discovered in Scotland, and the species re-discovered in 1998 at Braunton Burrows (N. Devon) after a gap of about seventy years. It is threatened by the lack of grazing at some Welsh sites, and perhaps also by hybridisation with G. amarella, although the latter view is not supported by Kay & John (1995).|European Temperate element.
Geranium columbinum|An annual of dry grasslands and grassland-scrub mosaics. Its habitats include sand dunes, scrubby cliff slopes, hedge banks, field margins, chalk and limestone downland, railway banks and old quarries. It is usually on calcareous soils, and is often a pioneer on disturbed sites. It favours warm, sheltered, often S.-facing banks and hollows. Lowland.|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There has been widespread decline in S.E. and N. England; analysis of the database reveals that most losses have occurred since 1950. These are probably due to habitat destruction, intensification of grassland management and scrub encroachment.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Geranium dissectum|An annual of grasslands, hedge banks, waysides and waste ground, and a common weed of flower borders, allotments and arable fields. Generally lowland, but reaching 380 m at Braemar (S. Aberdeen).|Archaeophyte|There appears to have been little change in the range of G. dissectum since the 1962 Atlas, although it is now recorded from many more squares. Its ability to thrive in disturbed, nutrient-enriched habitats makes it likely that this species is becoming more abundant in many areas.|As an archaeophyte G. dissectum has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Geranium endressii|A rhizomatous perennial herb found as a garden escape on grassy or wooded banks and roadsides around habitation; also occurring as a garden throw-out on rubbish tips and waste ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|G. endressii, introduced to Britain in 1812, is common in gardens and has been recorded in the wild since 1906. It has increased since the 1962 Atlas, although some records may be errors for G. x oxonianum as several cultivars of the hybrid are very similar to this parent. The frequent cultivar `Wargrave Pink` is probably also a form of G. x oxonianum, though Yeo (1985) considers it to be a cultivar of G. endressii.|Native of the Pyrenees; the native range is very restricted.
Geranium lucidum|An annual of roadside-banks, rock outcrops and scree, preferring calcareous soils and characteristic of limestone districts. It is widespread in artificial habitats, including mortared walls, churchyards, roadsides, waste ground and railway ballast; also as an escape from gardens. Generally lowland, but reaching 610 m at Melmerby High Scar (Cumberland).|Native|G. lucidum can be invasive, and there has been an expansion of its range and a marked increase in the number of 10-km squares since the 1962 Atlas. It is often very difficult to separate alien and native occurrences, and all records are mapped as if they are native.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © L. Rooney
Geranium molle|An annual found in a wide array of open habitats, including dry grasslands, rock outcrops, cultivated land, garden lawns, verges and waste ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 550 m at Moor House (Westmorland).|Native|There appears to have been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Geranium phaeum|This clump-forming perennial herb is well-naturalised on roadsides and railway banks, and in churchyards and wood-borders; it usually grows close to habitation as a garden escape or throw-out but is sometimes deliberately planted in the wild. It favours shaded situations and moist, fertile soils. Lowland.|Neophyte|G. phaeum has been known in the wild since 1724. Although better recorded since the 1962 Atlas, there is little evidence of any appreciable change in its distribution. It is a variable taxon with many named cultivars; most records are of the purplish-black flowered forms of var. phaeum, though the pinkish-mauve var. lividum and white `Album` have also been reported from the wild.|Native of the mountains of C. & S. Europe.
Geranium pratense|A perennial herb of rough grassland on verges, railway banks and streamsides, and in damp hay meadows and lightly grazed pastures, mainly on calcareous soils. Generally lowland, reaching 375 m at Alston (Cumberland), but exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|G. pratense was formerly frequent in hay meadows, but has become increasingly restricted to roadsides due to changes in agricultural practices. Alien sites have increased markedly since the 1962 Atlas; separating native and alien plants within its supposed native range can be difficult.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Geranium purpureum|Subspecies purpureum is an upright annual in stony or rocky places near the sea, on sheltered cliffs, disused railway lines, and particularly by roads and fields on the earth-and-stone sides of Cornish hedge banks. Subsp. forsteri is a prostrate plant of stabilised areas at the top of shingle beaches. Lowland.|Native|Since the 1962 Atlas, G. purpureum has been lost from some outlying areas, but in Cornwall it has increased markedly since about the mid-1970s, possibly benefiting from modern road verge management and recent mild winters.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © L. Rooney
Geranium pusillum|An annual of cultivated land, open summer-droughted grasslands, roadsides and waste places, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, although it is much better recorded now. G. pusillum is an elusive species and, because of its similarity with G. molle, it may have been overlooked in some squares.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Geranium pyrenaicum|A perennial herb of hedgerows, roadsides, field margins, rough grassy banks and waste places; often found growing close to habitation, and possibly sometimes occurring as a garden escape or throw-out. Lowland.|Neophyte|This conspicuous species was not recorded in Britain until 1762 and, although considered possibly native by Stace (1997), it is almost certainly an alien which appears to be increasing in many areas. In Hampshire, for example, it was described as being very rare in the late 19th century but is now widespread and fairly common.|Native of the mountains of S. Europe & S.W. Asia; it spread rapidly in W. & C. Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries and now has a European Temperate distribution.
Geranium robertianum|An annual or biennial shade-tolerant herb found on a wide range of soil types, except those that are strongly acidic. Its habitats include woods, hedgerows, walls, shaded banks, limestone pavements, screes and coastal shingle; also in disturbed artificial habitats. 0-700 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|There is no evidence of any appreciable change since the 1962 Atlas. G. robertianum is very variable; subsp. maritimum and subsp. celticum are mapped by Perring & Sell (1968).|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Geranium rotundifolium|An annual of hedgerows, dry roadside-banks and wall-tops, especially close to the sea, but spreading to roadside verges, rubble heaps, railway ballast and waste ground. It is also a garden and street weed. Colonies may be very persistent, even where the species is confined to weedy habitats. Lowland.|Native|G. rotundifolium has increased markedly since the 1962 Atlas. As a presumed native it is restricted to S. Britain and the extreme south of Ireland. However, given its spread in parts of S. England, it is possible that some recent, supposedly alien, records to the north of this could in fact represent a natural extension of its native range.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Geranium sanguineum|A rhizomatous, perennial herb of base-rich grasslands and scrub, open rocky woodlands, coastal cliffs and stabilised sand dunes; mainly on the coast but also inland on limestone pavements and cliff ledges, and in chalk and limestone grassland. As a native it has a curiously patchy distribution, and is often restricted to localised substrates such as dolerite and serpentine. It also occurs as a garden escape or throw-out on grassy banks, verges, tips and waste ground. 0-420 m (Ingleborough, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|The native distribution of G. sanguineum is similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas, but it is now much more frequent as a garden escape.|European Temperate element.
Geranium sylvaticum|A stoutly rhizomatous perennial herb of hay meadows, ungrazed damp woodlands, streamsides and mountain rock ledges, and in many areas a characteristic feature of laneside hedge banks and verges. Mainly upland, to 1005 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|G. sylvaticum has declined locally since the 1962 Atlas, particularly on the edges of its range, having been lost from many hay meadows due to the increased use of fertilisers and the widespread change to silage production (Halliday, 1997). It is grown in gardens, though much less frequently than G. pratense and G. sanguineum, and sometimes escapes.|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Geum rivale|A perennial herb of mildly acidic to calcareous, slow-draining or wet soils, in shaded or open habitats, including streamsides and flushes in deciduous woodland, carr, herb-rich hay meadows and montane willow scrub and tall-herb communities on ledges. Reproduction is by seed and by rhizomatous spread. 0?975 m (Beinn a` Chaoruinn, Westerness).|Native|G. rivale was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There have been widespread declines, particularly in C. and S. England, and analysis of the database reveals that these have mostly occurred since 1950. The species is also grown in gardens and sometimes escapes.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.
Geum urbanum|A perennial herb of freely-draining, mildly acidic to calcareous soils. It is found in moderate shade in deciduous woodland (especially in disturbed sites in secondary woodland), scrub and hedgerows and in more disturbed and open habitats, where it may grow as a street or garden weed. Generally lowland, but reaching 450 m on Alston Moor (Cumberland).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of G. urbanum since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Gladiolus communis|A cormous perennial of bulb fields, field margins, roadsides and rough ground. It is naturalised only in lowland areas experiencing very mild winters, as the corm is susceptible to winter frost. Lowland.|Neophyte|G. communis, introduced from S. Europe by 1596, is usually a persistent relic of cultivation. It was first recorded in the wild in 1862, but its distribution has probably changed little in recent years.|Native of the Mediterranean region.
Gladiolus illyricus|A cormous perennial of acidic, brown-earth soils, found on grass-heaths, usually in association with Pteridium which may afford the plant some protection from grazing. It reproduces primarily by offsets, as flowering and seed production appear to be limited. Lowland.|Native|First recorded in the wild in 1856, there has been little recent change in the overall distribution of this species, but populations have declined locally, probably as a result of recent changes in management such as Pteridium control and excessive or poorly managed burning.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element. Our plant may be an endemic subspecies.
Glaucium flavum|A short-lived perennial herb of shingle banks and stony beaches; also, more rarely, amongst loose rock and on eroding cliffs of sand and clay, and on the bare tops of chalk cliffs. The few inland records are of casual occurrences. Lowland.|Native|G. flavum has been lost from some sites in Britain in recent years as a result of coastal defence work and trampling pressures on tourist beaches. However, its overall distribution shows little change since the 1962 Atlas.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Glaux maritima|A perennial herb typically forming dense colonies on moist saline soils. Habitats include saltmarshes, strandlines, damp shingle, wet sand, brackish dune-slacks, aerobic mud and spray-drenched rock crevices. It is a poor competitor which often forms pure stands, but also grows in open communities with other halophytes. Lowland, but persisting as an introduction at 570 m (Hartside, Cumberland).|Native|There has been no change in the overall distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Glechoma hederacea|A carpet-forming stoloniferous perennial herb of woods, grassland, hedgerows and waste places, usually on fertile soils. It usually spreads vegetatively by rapid growth of its creeping stems, and seed-set is often very low. 0-465 m (Hawkswick Clowder, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|Although there is no evidence for a major change in distribution at the national scale, G. hederacea is apparently increasing within lowland woods, particularly in S.E. England, where excessive deer grazing has led to a decline in more palatable woodland ground-flora species (Cooke, 1994).|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.
Glyceria declinata|A perennial herb of muddy pond margins, cattle-trampled ditches and marshy fields; also in shallow water by ponds, rivers and canals. 0-500 m (Llyn Crugnant, Cards.).|Native|This species is easily overlooked, but its small stature and glaucous leaves give it a distinctive appearance. It was very under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas, and this is probably still true in some areas, especially in Ireland. It has evidently declined in some parts of E. England.|Suboceanic Temperate element.
Glyceria fluitans|A perennial herb of marshes, swamps and muddy pond margins, and forming floating rafts in shallow water by ditches, rivers, ponds and lakes; tolerant of high levels of disturbance and nutrient-enrichment. 0?720 m (Knock Fell, Westmorland).|Native|This species was rather unevenly recorded in the 1962 Atlas, but there is no evidence of any appreciable change in range over the last forty years.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Glyceria fluitans x notata (G. x pedicellata)|A stoloniferous perennial herb of ponds, ditches, streams and swampy depressions in pastures, growing with one or both parents, or with neither. It is highly sterile, but spreads vegetatively and detached ramets may be carried by water to new sites. 0?550 m (Moor House, Westmorland).|Native|The map in Perring & Sell (1968) under-estimated the distribution of this taxon. The apparent extension of range in some areas, particularly in Ireland, is likely to be attributable to better recording. It is probably still underrecorded, and there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether its distribution is changing.|Widespread in temperate Europe.
Glyceria maxima|A rhizomatous perennial herb growing in ditches, canals, lakes and ponds, either rooted on the bank or in the water, and often forming floating rafts; also in seasonally-flooded grasslands. It was formerly cultivated as a fodder crop, and is much planted in ponds. Generally lowland, but reaching 600 m at Sprinkling Tarn (Cumberland).|Native|G. maxima has increased since the 1962 Atlas, particularly in the north, either by deliberate introductions or by natural spread from sites where it was probably originally planted. Many of these populations are shown as native on the map.|Circumpolar Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Glyceria notata|A stoloniferous perennial herb of ditches, streams and muddy pond margins, occurring on more calcareous substrates than other British Glyceria species. It reproduces by seed and by detached stolons. 0-380 m (Malham Tarn, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|G. notata was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Although it was probably under-recorded in the past, there are sufficient older records to suggest that it has declined in parts of S. England because of drainage.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.
Gnaphalium luteoalbum|An annual or biennial of sandy fields, dune-slacks and waste ground; now restricted as an apparent native to the Channel Islands, the margins of two recently created pools in Norfolk and an area of excavated shingle in Kent. Recent records elsewhere are mainly of casual plants on waste ground, although it is thriving on tracks and a rubbish tip in Dorset. Lowland.|Native|G. luteoalbum was first recorded in 1690 and became extinct at all its presumed native Breckland sites in the early 20th century. It was discovered in E. Kent in 1996.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, reaching its northern limit in S. Sweden. It is widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Gnaphalium norvegicum|This perennial herb occurs on ungrazed rock ledges, crags, river gorges, screes and in gullies, preferring a southerly or easterly aspect and an acidic, well-drained mineral soil. From 600 m (Aonach air Chrith, W. Ross) to 980 m (Sgurr na Lapaich, Easterness).|Native|Although there is little evidence of a significant decline in the number of sites (currently about thirty), populations of G. norvegicum are small and vulnerable to rock falls and avalanches, though new habitat is also created this way. There are now twice as many records as in the 1962 Atlas, largely due to a special survey carried out in the 1990s.|European Arctic-montane element; also in C. Asia and N. America.
Gnaphalium supinum|A dwarf, perennial herb, found on mountain-top fell-field communities, wet grassy slopes, cliffs, moraines and late snow-patches, where it grows in sites which are relatively well-drained and stony and dry out in summer. Usually from 455 to 1305 m (Ben Macdui, S. Aberdeen), but descending to 300 m on river gravels at Killin (Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of G. supinum is probably stable. It may still be present in those 10-km squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|European Arctic-montane element; also in C. Asia and N. America.     © Pete Stroh
Gnaphalium sylvaticum|A short-lived perennial herb of open communities on dry, acidic, often sandy or gravelly soils. Habitats include heaths and heathy pastures, sand-pits, dunes, tracks and, especially, open woodland and forestry rides in areas of former heathland. 0-850 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|There was little indication in the 1962 Atlas that G. sylvaticum was decreasing outside Ireland, Wales and S.W. England. However, it now appears to be declining throughout its range, despite probably being one of the few native vascular plant species to benefit from the extensive afforestation programmes of the 20th century.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; also in N.

Gnaphalium uliginosum|An annual of open, muddy ground, usually subject to waterlogging during the winter. It is characteristic of trampled field entrances, compacted arable and cultivated land, the margins of reservoirs and the edges of summer-dry ponds trampled by cattle. It is also found on rutted tracks on heaths and wet rides in woodland. It prefers mildly to quite strongly acidic soils. 0-470 m (Glen Kyllachy, Easterness).|Native|The distribution of G. uliginosum has increased since the 1962 Atlas, probably due to its preference for disturbed habitats. The species is also better recorded now.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Goodyera repens|A creeping, evergreen perennial herb of semi-natural and planted coniferous woodland, usually of Pinus sylvestris, where it grows in slight to moderate shade in moist layers of moss and pine-needles. It is also found under Pinus on old sand dunes. 0-335 m (Morinsh, Banffs.).|Native|Felling and replanting of P. sylvestris has caused losses of G. repens from many sites, as has increased shading and scrub encroachment. Sites in East Anglia and Cumbria may result from natural colonisation by wind-blown seed, but plants could have been introduced with seedling pines from Scotland.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Groenlandia densa|A perennial herb of shallow, clear, base-rich water which may grow in lakes and rivers, but is more frequent in smaller waters such as streams, canals, ditches and ponds. It rarely colonises newly available habitats, although it is sometimes found as an introduction in ponds. Generally lowland, but reaching 380 m at Malham Tarn (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|G. densa has declined in Britain due to urbanisation, which has led to its loss from the London area, eutrophication and the loss of spring-fed streams and ditches because of falling water tables. This decline began before 1930, but is still continuing.|European Temperate element.
Gymnadenia conopsea|A tuberous perennial herb of both dry and moist chalk and limestone grasslands, limestone pavement, less acidic heaths, and wetter habitats such as base-rich fens. It also grows in artificial habitats, including quarries and railway banks. 0-610 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined throughout its range, probably due to habitat destruction, ploughing of pastures and drainage. Three subspecies are currently recognised, although each may deserve specific rank (Bateman et al., 1997); they are mapped separately.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.
Gymnocarpium dryopteris|A gregarious, deciduous fern growing in rocky deciduous woodland and ravines, along stream banks, and on cliff ledges and stable block screes. It prefers moist but open, light-textured mineral soils with a high humus content, and tolerates a moderate range of pH. 0-915 m (Rannoch, Mid Perth).|Native|This species, which is susceptible to heavy grazing, has declined at the edges of its British range, where it has been lost from lowland woods even though the woods themselves often survive. Most of the losses occurred before 1950. It was last recorded in Ireland in 1986.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Gymnocarpium robertianum|A deciduous fern of cracks, fissures and scree in limestone rock, but also found in shallow grikes of limestone pavement, and, rarely, on chalk. It prefers warm, sunny exposures but can tolerate light shading. It has become established as a garden escape on walls and culverts. Lowland to 585 m at Carreg yr Ogof (Carms.).|Native|The distribution of this species is stable. Some sites have, however, been lost through competition with Mercurialis perennis and Crataegus monogyna, while quarrying and overgrazing have had detrimental effects on others.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Hammarbya paludosa|A pseudobulbous herb of boggy areas where the water is usually acidic but subject to some lateral movement. Typically it grows amongst saturated Sphagnum, but also on peaty mud and among grasses on the edges of runnels and flushes. 0-500 m (Llyn Anafon, Caerns.).|Native|Drainage of bogs, particularly in the lowlands, has caused a dramatic decline of this species, especially before 1930. Overgrazing may have caused losses in the uplands. It is inconspicuous and under-recorded in some areas; intensive searches in others have shown it to be more frequent than previously thought.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Hedera helix|An evergreen perennial woody climber most characteristic of woodland, scrub and hedgerows, but also common on walls, rock outcrops and cliffs. It may carpet the ground in secondary woodland. It generally favours basic to moderately acidic soils. It is highly palatable to deer and stock, and in grazed upland areas becomes restricted to inaccessible rock outcrops. 0-610 m (Mourne Mountains, Co. Down).|Native|The range of this species is unchanged since the 1962 Atlas. The two native subspecies (subsp. helix and subsp. hibernica) are mapped separately.|European Southern-temperate element.
Helianthemum apenninum|A perennial sub-shrub, found in open, dry rocky limestone grassland (of which it is a conspicuous component where it occurs), generally on S-facing slopes; also limestone crags and cliff edges. It is found on more skeletal soils than H. nummularium, and hybrid plants (H. x sulphureum) may be found in intermediate habitats at sites where both species occur. Lowland.|Native|Although there has been no change in its 10-km distribution, H. apenninum is less frequent than formerly in some of its sites, mainly because of scrub colonisation following the decline of rabbits.|Mediterranean-montane element.
Helianthemum nummularium|A prostrate sub-shrub occurring in short, dry, calcareous grassland, and rather strictly confined to chalk and limestone in England, but extending into mildly acid pastures and heaths on well-drained soils in E. Scotland, and on base-rich soils over basalt in N.E. England and E. Scotland. 0-640 m (Mickle Fell, N.W. Yorks., and in Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that most losses have occurred since 1950, caused by conversion of chalk grassland to arable and its reversion to scrub. Its rarity in Ireland has long been a phytogeographical conundrum.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Helianthemum oelandicum|This small, prostrate, perennial sub-shrub is often abundant in short, open, rocky Carboniferous limestone grassland, on rock outcrops and on cliff edges. It typically grows in exposed S.- to W.-facing sites. 0-540 m (Cronkley Fell, N.W. Yorks.).|Native|The distribution of H. oelandicum has remained largely unchanged since at least the 1950s. Subsp. incanum occurs in Wales and N.W. England, the endemic subsp. levigatum occurs on Cronkley Fell and subsp. piloselloides grows in W. Ireland.|Mediterranean-montane element. The species is morphologically very variable and has a highly disjunct range in Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Helianthus annuus|A tall, showy annual, found as a casual, or sometimes persisting, on waste ground, rubbish tips and roadsides. Lowland.|Neophyte|H. annuus was introduced to Britain by 1596. It is widely grown in gardens and on allotments, but is sometimes cultivated on a field scale for its oil-bearing seeds. It also arises from bird-seed, food for small mammals and from wool shoddy. It was first recorded in the wild in 1902, and is an increasingly frequent relic of cultivation.|Native of N. America.
Helianthus tuberosus|This perennial herb is occasionally recorded on rubbish tips, waste ground and as a relic of cultivation. Lowland.|Neophyte|H. tuberosus was cultivated in Britain by 1617 for its edible tubers, then known as `potatoes of Canada`, and is now grown in gardens. Although it flowers only after long hot summers, its tubers can survive as garden throw-outs, or plants can arise from bird-seed. It was known to occur in the wild by 1897, and is probably increasing.|Native of N. America.
Helictotrichon pratense|A perennial herb of calcareous rendzina and brown earth soils, usually over chalk or limestone, but also over glacial deposits and basic igneous rocks. It is characteristic of well-grazed chalk and limestone downland, but is also found on screes, cliffs and limestone pavements, and occasionally in open Fraxinus woods, on sand dunes and on montane ledge communities with Dryas octopetala. 0-835 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of H. pratense is stable, though the apparent losses in S.E. England may be significant indicators of a decline in the lowlands. Montane populations with larger spikelets may be taxonomically distinct.|European Temperate element.
Helictotrichon pubescens|A perennial grass growing in a wide range of moist or dry, neutral and calcareous grasslands. It is found in meadows and pastures, on roadsides and railway banks, in open woodland and rides, coastal cliffs, fixed dunes, mildly acidic grassland over gravel, and some less acidic heaths. It tolerates modest mowing, grazing and manuring, but not artificial fertilisers or competition from vigorous fodder-grasses. 0-550 m (Moor House, Cumberland).|Native|Although H. pubescens is now known to be much more frequent than when mapped in the 1962 Atlas, there have clearly been some losses throughout its range.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.
Helleborus foetidus|A short-lived perennial herb of shallow calcareous soils. It is a poor competitor, and intolerant of deep shade, so is usually found in small colonies in woodland glades or open scrub, on scree slopes, rock ledges, hedge banks, and as an introduction in churchyards. Adult plants near senescence (4-5 years old) are typically found with a cohort of seedlings. Lowland.|Native|The native range of this species has been obscured by the presence of numerous naturalised populations. It is often grown as a garden plant and escapes can become established in the wild, although sometimes for only a few years.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Helleborus viridis|A perennial herb of rather shady habitats, usually on chalk or limestone, found in woodland glades, rocky dingles and old hedge banks. Populations are often small, but persist over many years without obvious changes in numbers. Lowland.|Native|H. viridis has been grown in gardens since medieval times, and was recorded in the wild by 1562. It is very difficult to delimit its native range. The decline apparent on the map may be partly attributable to records of introductions which failed to persist, but long-established populations have been lost as a result of the clearance of hedges and copses and the cessation of coppicing.|Suboceanic Temperate element.     © O. Pescott
Heracleum mantegazzianum|A very large perennial herb occurring in derelict gardens, neglected urban places and waste ground, on rubbish tips, roadsides and by streams and rivers, forming large colonies if allowed to prosper. It spreads by seed, which is prolifically produced. Lowland.|Neophyte|H. mantegazzianum was introduced to gardens as a monumental curiosity by 1820. It was deliberately planted by rivers and ponds and was first recorded in the wild in 1828 (Cambs.). Its spread has been rapid since the 1962 Atlas, despite the fact that the plant has been the subject of control measures now that its capacity to cause dermatitis has become known.|Native of S.W. Asia.
Heracleum sphondylium|A robust perennial herb of dry or moist, neutral to calcareous soils. It has a wide habitat range, including rough and disturbed grassland, especially on roadsides and trackways, woodland rides, scrub, river banks, stabilised dunes, coastal cliffs, montane tall-herb vegetation and waste ground. 0-1005 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of H. sphondylium since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Herminium monorchis|A tuberous perennial herb of short turf on calcareous soils overlying chalk or oolitic limestone, particularly on the small terracettes of steep slopes. It also grows on quarry floors and on old lime kiln spoil heaps. Lowland.|Native|By 1930 this species had been lost from many sites, especially in East Anglia, through ploughing and increased grazing. Losses have continued, mostly due to a lack of grazing and consequent scrub encroachment, but have been partly offset by its ability to colonise new sites such as quarries.|Eurasian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © L. Rooney
Herniaria ciliolata|This mat-forming perennial grows in short, open vegetation, usually on dry, base-rich soils or rocks on S.-facing slopes. Its habitats include coastal cliff-slopes, valley sides, dune grassland, rock outcrops and open patches in heathlands. More ruderal habitats include path edges and stone-faced banks. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas. In our area there are two endemic subspecies, subsp. ciliolata (Cornwall, Alderney and Guernsey) and subsp. subciliata (Jersey).|Oceanic Southern-temperate element; confined to the coast of W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Herniaria glabra|An annual or short-lived perennial of compacted sandy or gravelly soils, often with chalk or limestone fragments. Its habitats are generally kept open by seasonal standing water or other disturbance, and include forestry rides, golf courses, car parks, disused gravel-pits and disturbed areas in short grassland. Lowland.|Native|Intensive surveys since the 1962 Atlas have shown H. glabra to have a wider distribution in East Anglia, with new sites still being discovered. However, it is presumed extinct in Cambridgeshire, where it was last seen in 1990. It has appeared as a casual in many sites, possibly as a garden escape, and is sometimes naturalised.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Hesperis matronalis|A perennial, or sometimes biennial, herb of shaded moist habitats, found in hedgerows and wood borders, on river-banks, roadsides and waste ground, usually near habitation. It is often well-naturalised, but only where there is little competition. Casual plants occur on tips and in waste places. Lowland.|Neophyte|H. matronalis has been cultivated in gardens since at least 1375 (Harvey, 1981), and was known in the wild by 1805. The increase in records since the 1962 Atlas may indicate a real change, but is more likely to be due to better recording of aliens.|Native of S. Europe and W. Asia, although absent from the Mediterranean area; widely naturalised in C. & N. Europe, N. America and elsewhere.
Hierochloe odorata|A rhizomatous perennial herb occurring in a range of wetland habitats, including lakeside reed-beds, sedge swamps, Salix carr, river banks and wet meadows; also, in S.W. Scotland, at the base of coastal cliffs where streams emerge and along the upper edge of fringing saltmarshes. 0-300 m (Clearburn Loch, Selkirks.).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of H. odorata since the 1962 Atlas, though it is now known to be frequent in Orkney, where it was first recorded in 1980, and where all sites are near Norse church sites. It is abundant at its only site in Ireland, on Lough Neagh.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Himantoglossum hircinum|A tuberous, winter-green perennial herb growing on chalk and, rarely, limestone in open grassland, on roadsides and in quarries, and occasionally on calcareous sand dunes and heathland. Lowland.|Native|This species was restricted to Kent until the early 1900s, when it underwent a remarkable expansion, reaching as far north as Yorkshire. After 1934, it declined rapidly but maintained this range. Many occurrences are of monocarpic plants; with 9-11 populations recorded each year the map over-emphasises losses as historical records accumulate. Only two populations are definitely self-sustaining, although two more may be so.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Hippocrepis comosa|A perennial herb occurring in dry, sunny pastures on chalk and limestone, and on rock ledges on limestone cliffs. It prefers a S.-facing aspect, an open situation, and is able to colonise bare chalk, such as that in new road cuttings. Generally lowland, but reaching 600 m on Long Fell, Warcop (Westmorland).|Native|The map suggests little change in this species, other than a few losses from outlying squares and around the fringes of its core areas. However, county floras report declines, even within its main strongholds, due to grassland improvement, conversion to arable and scrub encroachment following the cessation of grazing.|European Temperate element.
Hippophae rhamnoides|A thorny deciduous shrub or small tree of stabilised sand dunes and coastal banks, spreading by rhizomes and layering and often forming dense thickets. It is dioecious and wind-pollinated, flowering in the winter or early spring on bare wood and fruiting in autumn. Lowland.|Native|A dominant plant of the late glacial period and still found in montane habitats in continental Europe and the Himalayas, but in Britain native only in coastal habitats. It is planted widely as an amenity shrub within and outside its native range, and its invasive spread can pose a major threat to native vegetation.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in C. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Hippuris vulgaris|This herbaceous perennial occurs in two growth forms. Plants with long, flaccid stems grow as submerged aquatics, and are sometimes abundant in clear calcareous water. More rigid, stiffly erect shoots grow as emergents at the edge of lakes and ponds, in swamps or in upland flushes. These may be very robust when growing on deep, eutrophic mud. 0-900 m (Moine Mhor, Easterness), but rare above 400 m.|Native|There is little evidence for any marked change in the distribution of this species, although it has spread as an introduction in some counties.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Hirschfeldia incana|An annual or short-lived perennial herb, increasingly naturalised in a variety of waste places such as by docks, railways and roadsides, and on tips. It is often associated with grain imports and bird-seed, and frequently occurs as a casual. It was formerly introduced with wool shoddy. Lowland.|Neophyte|H. incana was cultivated in Britain by 1771 and was recorded from the wild by 1837, but 19th-century records are rare. It seems to be one of the few casuals that has spread from tips and survived, and it is now markedly increasing its range, having persisted at some sites for forty years.|Native of S.W. Europe, the Mediterranean region and S.W. Asia; widely naturalised further north in Europe.
Holcus lanatus|A short-lived, tufted perennial found in a wide range of grasslands, including hay meadows, pastures, chalk and limestone grassland, and also occurring in hedge banks, open woodland and moorland. It grows in dry to winter-wet, acidic to calcareous soils, and is most vigorous in moist but not waterlogged habitats. It tolerates mowing and grazing, but not heavy trampling. 0-650 m (Cross Fell, Cumberland), and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the range of H. lanatus since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Holcus mollis|A creeping, rhizomatous perennial of well-drained acidic or neutral soils, found in Quercus and Betula woods, open conifer plantations, hedge banks, on heathland, and under Pteridium. It is capable of spreading into damper grassland and is locally a troublesome weed of arable land. H. mollis tolerates occasional mowing or light grazing but is a poor competitor with more vigorous grasses. 0-580 m (Greygarth Fell, W. Lancashire).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the range of H. mollis since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.
Homogyne alpina|This shortly-creeping perennial herb grows as a possible native on a single, broad, cliff ledge on a wet hillside in the Clova Mountains, Angus. Reproduction appears to be only by rhizomatous spread. The altitude is c. 600 m.|Native|or alien. This species was discovered in Clova in 1813, but not refound until 1951. There is a long-standing and unresolved debate as to whether it was deliberately planted there. Plants were translocated to nearby sites in the 1990s. H. alpina was also recorded from South Uist in 1955, where it was deliberately planted and is now extinct.|A European Boreo-arctic Montane species, endemic to the mountains of W., C. & E. Europe from Spain to Bulgaria.
Honckenya peploides|H. peploides is a succulent perennial herb with creeping stolons that make it well adapted to growing in mobile substrates. It often occurs in abundance on shingle beaches and on shifting sand in foreshore communities. It is one of the pioneer colonists of open foredunes with plants such as Elytrigia juncea. Lowland.|Native|There does not appear to be any significant change since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element, with a disjunct distribution.     © L. Rooney
Hordelymus europaeus|A perennial herb of woods and copses on calcareous soils, especially in sheltered beech woodlands and along medieval boundary banks and old hedgerows. Generally lowland, but reaching 440 m at Brough (Westmorland).|Native|Although now better recorded since the 1962 Atlas, H. europaeus has declined across much of its range mainly due to the removal of hedge banks and the coniferisation of deciduous woodland. It has not been seen in Ireland since 1949.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Hordeum distichon||||
Hordeum distichon sens.lat.|The common cultivated barley, occurring frequently but rarely persisting in waste places, fields, waysides and around farm buildings. It is mainly a relic of cultivation, but also occurs on roadsides from spilt grain and as a casual from wool shoddy and bird-seed. Lowland.|Casual|Barley has been cultivated in Britain for thousands of years, but was not recorded from the wild until 1908. This map includes records of the commonly cultivated H. distichon sens. str. and the rarer H. vulgare, which is also mapped separately. The species have sometimes been ignored by recorders, and are certainly under-recorded in some areas.|Unknown as a wild plant; widely cultivated in temperate regions throughout the world.
Hordeum jubatum|A short-lived perennial herb of roadsides, re-sown grassland and waste places, occurring as a casual from wool shoddy and bird-seed, and as a contaminant of commercial grass-seed mixtures. It is often found with maritime species beside salt-treated roads. Generally lowland, but reaching 410 m (Devil`s Beef Tub, Dumfriess.).|Neophyte|H. jubatum was introduced as a fodder grass in 1782 and has been recorded from the wild since 1890. It was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas, but it has increased since 1970, particularly along roadsides.|Native of N. America and E. Asia; widely naturalised in N. & W. Europe.
Hordeum marinum|An annual of barish places by the sea, on the trampled margins of dried-up pools and ditches in grazing marshes, on tracks and sea walls, and in the uppermost parts of saltmarshes; also, very locally, beside salt-treated roads inland. Lowland.|Native|H. marinum has decreased in Britain, particularly along the S. coast and the E. coast from the Wash northwards. This is thought to be due to the rebuilding of sea defences, infilling of pools and ditches, the wholesale conversion of coastal grazing marshes to arable land, and, locally, the cessation of grazing.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; also in C. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Hordeum murinum|An annual growing in all kinds of fertile, disturbed ground, on roadsides, pavements, walls, railway banks and rough grassland. Generally lowland, but reaching 450 m on the Kirkstone Pass (Westmorland).|Archaeophyte|The distribution of this species is stable in Britain, but shows some increase in Ireland. Three subspecies occur in our area: subsp. murinum is common throughout the range, while subsp. glaucum and subsp. leporinum are infrequent casuals from wool shoddy and esparto.|As an archaeophyte H. murinum has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Hordeum secalinum|A perennial herb of meadows, pastures and roadsides, often in river valley floodplains and showing a strong preference for sticky clay soils. In coastal areas it is frequently abundant in grazing marsh grasslands and on earthen sea walls. Lowland.|Native|The map suggests little apparent change in the distribution of H. secalinum since the 1962 Atlas, apart from losses in a few outlying squares in N. and W. Britain. However, in some counties it is reported to be decreasing due to drainage, re-seeding and the conversion of grassland to arable. It can, however, withstand modest improvement. Its overall distribution is stable in Ireland.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Hordeum vulgare|H. vulgare is sometimes found on arable land as a relic of cultivation, and on roadsides and waste ground as a bird-seed and grain casual. Lowland.|Casual|H. vulgare was known from the wild in Britain by at least 1905. It is now seldom grown as a crop in our area, and has thus probably decreased as a casual, though its decline in arable habitats may have been offset to some extent by recent introductions as a bird-seed casual. It is almost certainly ignored by many recorders; cereal relics were rarely recorded before 1970, but must have been just as frequent then as now.|Originated in cultivation; grown in temperate climates worldwide.
Hornungia petraea|A winter-annual of very open habitats on calcareous soils and rocks which are subject to summer drought, especially on rocky slopes on Carboniferous limestone and on fixed but open sand dunes. It also occurs as an alien on garden walls and in chalk-pits. Generally lowland, but reaching 490 m near Hawes (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|The distribution of H. petraea is stable, and scrub invasion of its open habitats is the only reported threat.|European Temperate element.
Hottonia palustris|A stoloniferous perennial of still, shallow, base-rich, clear and not eutrophicated water bodies, including ponds, ditches, ox-bows and backwaters. It can withstand shade and temporary exposure. It is heterostylous, requiring crosses between pins and thrums to set seed; vegetative growth often produces single-morph colonies that set little seed. Lowland.|Native|Many colonies of H. palustris have been lost to drainage, vegetation clearance, eutrophication, boat traffic and trampling by cattle. Most of these losses occurred before 1930, but have continued, particularly in S.E. England.|European Temperate element.
Humulus lupulus|A scrambling, perennial, dioecious climber which is probably native in moist, open woods, fen carr and hedges. It is frequent as an escape from cultivation or as a planted ornamental. Lowland.|Native|H. lupulus has long been cultivated for flavouring beer; a widespread cultivar was introduced from Flanders in the 16th century for that purpose. It is very difficult to separate possibly native from alien plants; it is certainly alien in Ireland and north of Yorkshire and Lancashire, and many records in S. Britain are relics of cultivation. Mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, its overall distribution is stable.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; also in E. Asia and N. America and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Huperzia selago|A semi-decumbent evergreen perennial herb found on acidic, nutrient-poor, sandy or peaty soils in grassland, heathland, blanket bog, montane communities and, rarely, sand quarry tips. Generally upland, but from sea level to 1310 m (Ben Nevis, Westerness, and Ben Macdui, S. Aberdeen).|Native|Most of the sites in lowland England were lost before 1930, due to habitat destruction, agricultural improvement and drainage.

Hyacinthoides hispanica||||
Hyacinthoides non-scripta|A bulbous perennial herb occurring, sometimes abundantly, in a wide variety of deciduous woodlands, in hedgerows, on shady banks and, especially in western and upland areas, in meadows, under Pteridium and on cliffs. It also occurs as a naturalised garden escape. It is sensitive to long-term grazing. Generally lowland, but reaching 685 m on Craig-yr-Ysfa (Caerns.).|Native|The overall distribution of H. non-scripta is stable and it remains abundant in suitable habitats throughout its range. A very few populations (e.g. in Norfolk) have been damaged recently by large-scale commercial collection.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Hydrilla verticillata|In Britain and Ireland, H. verticillata grows in relatively deep water in mesotrophic lakes, only occasionally extending into the shallows. The Irish population is known to be female, but flowers have never been seen in Britain. Reproduction is by turions. Lowland.|Native|Although this species was first discovered in Britain at Esthwaite Water (Westmorland) in 1914 it has not been seen at this site since 1941, and may have been eliminated by eutrophication. It survives at Lough Rusheenduff (W. Galway), where it was discovered in 1935, and it was found in Kirkcudbrightshire in 1999.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Hydrocharis morsus-ranae|The floating rosettes of this perennial are found in shallow, calcareous, mesotrophic or meso-eutrophic water in the sheltered bays of lakes or in ponds, canals and ditches. Reproduction is primarily vegetative; viable seed is sometimes set, but seedlings are probably rare. Lowland.|Native|This species has declined in Britain, having suffered from the conversion of grazing marshes to arable, and from eutrophication. It is more stable in Ireland, where it is more frequent in lakes. It is increasingly planted or discarded in the wild.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Hydrocotyle ranunculoides|"A robust perennial herb found rooted in mud or as free-floating or emergent colonies on the surface of still or slowly moving water, such as lakes, ponds, streams, ditches and canals. It can form very dense colonies, excluding native species at many sites. Rooted plants flower and set-seed; floating plants spread by rooted stem fragments. Lowland.
 



      Trends    

Neophyte. <i>H. ranunculoides</i> is widely sold in aquatic plant nurseries and was first recorded in the wild in 1990 (S. Essex). It appears to be spreading rapidly – it was recorded from only ten 10-km squares by Preston & Croft (1997). Its competitive ability and rapid spread is a cause of great concern and current eradication measures cost an estimated £250–300,000 in herbicide per annum.

Hydrocotyle vulgaris|A mat-forming perennial herb found in a wide range of damp or wet habitats, including carr, mires, fens, fen-meadows, swamps, marshes, in soakways and along spring-lines, and in dune-slacks and wet hollows in stabilised shingle. In very oceanic areas it grows in drier habitats, such as turfed wall-tops. 0-530 m (Tal-y-Fan, Caerns.).|Native|H. vulgaris was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined, and analysis of the database reveals that most of the losses have occurred since 1950. Drainage and development have steadily eliminated its sites in S.E. England.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Hymenophyllum tunbrigense|A rhizomatous perennial fern of very sheltered, often deeply shaded, humid habitats; these include acidic rock faces, humic banks and tree trunks, particularly in deep stream valleys, and crevices on upland boulder scree. 0-760 m (Galtee Mountains, Co. Tipperary).|Native|The distribution of H. tunbrigense is largely stable, although until recently many small populations have been overlooked. However, 20% of sites in S.E. England have been lost since 1950, largely through woodland loss and shading by Rhododendron ponticum.|Oceanic Temperate element; also one site in N. America.
Hymenophyllum wilsonii|A rhizomatous perennial fern, forming dense colonies on a variety of substrates, including sheltered acidic or, rarely, mildly basic rocks, and trees in humid sites. It also occurs on damp upland cliffs, boulder scree and, rarely, old walls. 0-1005 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|The distribution of H. wilsonii is largely stable, although there have apparently been losses since the 1962 Atlas, particularly in upland areas of C. and E. Scotland. Some of this may be due to under-recording.|Oceanic Boreo-temperate element; confined to the hyperoceanic zone of W. Europe and Macaronesia.
Hyoscyamus niger|A biennial herb of dry, calcareous soils, particularly those overlying chalk, and on coastal sandhills, sandy open areas and waste ground. It prefers disturbed ground, including rabbit warrens and building sites. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|There is a continuous archaeological record of H. niger in Britain from the Bronze age onwards. Declines before 1930, particularly in Ireland, were evident in the 1962 Atlas and have continued markedly since then, mostly through the increased use of herbicides.|As an archaeophyte H. niger has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that it is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Hypericum androsaemum|A shrub of damp or shaded habitats including woods and hedgerows. It is also widely cultivated and occurs well outside its native range in semi-natural and artificial, often drier habitats, being apparently spread by birds. 0?630 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|The native distribution of H. androsaemum is now much better documented, and alien occurrences are more frequent, or more frequently reported, than in the 1962 Atlas. The boundary of the native distribution cannot be defined with certainty.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © O.L. Pescott
Hypericum calycinum|A low-growing, rhizomatous shrub, widely cultivated and naturalised in hedgerows and on roadsides and railway banks. Lowland.|Neophyte|H. calycinum was introduced into Britain in 1676, but not recorded from the wild until 1809. All naturalised plants appear to have been derived from the original introduction, as fertile seed is sparsely and erratically produced owing to self-incompatibility. Damp autumns also reduce seed-set, and seed and the rare seedlings suffer predation by sparrows. Recent new introductions to cultivation may, however, alter this situation. H. calycinum is much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas.|Native of S.E. Bulgaria and Turkey.
Hypericum canadense|An annual to perennial tap-rooted herb of acidic, sandy or peaty soil in flushes or by small streams on moorland, heathland or in rough grazing. It grows in wet turf which is grazed or trampled by cattle. Lowland.|Neophyte|H. canadense was cultivated in 1770, but is not grown as a garden plant. It was first found in 1954 at Lough Mask (W. Galway) and later at Glengarriff (W. Cork). It is almost certainly an introduction from eastern N. America, although no one knows how it arrived.|Native of eastern N. America from Newfoundland to N. Florida and Alabama; in Europe, known only from the Netherlands (first found in 1909) and Ireland.
Hypericum elodes|A stoloniferous perennial herb of peat or peaty mineral soils in damp or wet acidic, nutrient-poor habitats, usually found in shallow water, but sometimes terrestrial, or in deeper water where it may form floating mats. It occurs in heathland pools, on the margins of ponds and slow-flowing streams, and along seepages and runnels in mires. 0-425 m (Exmoor, S. Somerset).|Native|The range of H. elodes has been considerably reduced in the last hundred and fifty years, and its habitats are increasingly threatened, mostly by drainage. Although many losses in England occurred before 1930, this decline has continued since the 1962 Atlas.|Oceanic Temperate element; one remaining site in Italy, extinct in eastern Germany and Austria.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Hypericum hirsutum|A perennial herb of well-drained, neutral to basic soils in open or partially shaded habitats including rough and ungrazed grassland, woodland rides and clearings, river banks, roadside banks and verges. 0-450 m at Garrigill (Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of H. hirsutum in Britain seems stable. In Ireland it appears to be declining; it was last seen in the Belfast area in 1937.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Hypericum humifusum|A short-lived perennial herb of open well-drained habitats (heaths, dry moors, open woodlands, tracksides, sometimes roadside banks) on light acidic soils; if apparently on calcareous soils, then rooting in a shallow acidic surface layer. Generally lowland, but reaching 530 m at Cat-and-Fiddle, Cheshire.|Native|Although H. humifusum is widespread, it is always local and rarely more than locally abundant. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that the widespread decline in England and Scotland has occurred since 1950. Losses in W. Ireland are probably due to under-recording.|European Temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Hypericum linariifolium|A short-lived perennial, or sometimes biennial, herb of steep rocky slopes and eroded banks with a southerly aspect, on well-drained acidic soils and without shading or competition. It reproduces by seed, which is copiously produced. Lowland.|Native|Recent detailed recording in E. Devon has revealed many new sites. The distribution of populations in such core areas may now be stable, but some outlying populations are small. Intermediates (which might be hybrids) with H. humifusum are found in the Channel Islands, and isoenzyme studies suggest there may be introgressed populations in mainland Britain (Kay & John, 1995).|Oceanic Southern-temperate element; it reaches its world northern limit in N. Wales.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Hypericum maculatum|A shortly rhizomatous perennial herb growing in damp shaded places, but also in more ruderal habitats such as quarries, waste ground and rough, grassy places. 0?380 m (Cotterdale, N.W. Yorks.).|Native|Many of the areas in which H. maculatum grows were not well recorded in the 1962 Atlas and its distribution is now much better known. Two subspecies occur in our area, the diploid subsp. maculatum and the tetraploid subsp. obtusiusculum, and these are mapped separately.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.
Hypericum montanum|This perennial herb is almost confined to chalk and limestone districts, and only occasionally found over other substrates. It prefers well-drained soils, and grows by hedges and in thickets, amongst scrub, in rough grassland, open woodland and rides, and the grikes of limestone pavement. Reproduction is by seed, and vegetative spread is very slow. 0-330 m (above Great Asby, Westmorland).|Native|Habitat loss or degradation accounts for much of the loss of this species from former sites, most of which occurred before 1930. This remains the main threat to its populations, which tend to be small and therefore vulnerable.|European Temperate element.
Hypericum perforatum|A variable, rhizomatous perennial herb of meadows, hedge banks, open woods, roadsides and along railways. It often grows in drier, more ruderal and more calcareous habitats than H. maculatum. It reproduces by seed and also sometimes by root buds. 0-480 m (Great Rhos, Rads.), with an exceptional record at 845 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|Suitable natural habitat is rare in N. Scotland, but H. perforatum extended into this region along railways during the 20th century. Otherwise there has been little change since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Hypericum pulchrum|A perennial herb of heaths and open woods on non-calcareous, fairly dry, sandy, peaty, or leached soils. Reproduction is by seed, and budding from the roots sometimes occurs. A dwarf form with prostrate to procumbent stems (var. procumbens) occurs in exposed habitats in N. and W. Scotland and in islands off W. Ireland. 0-820 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|H. pulchrum was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that the decline in C. England has occurred since 1950.|Suboceanic Temperate element.
Hypericum tetrapterum|A shortly rhizomatous perennial herb of eutrophic damp or wet habitats including damp meadows, marshes, streamsides and open ditches. Usually lowland, but ascending to 380 m in W. Yorkshire.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of H. tetrapterum, which was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.
Hypericum undulatum|A shortly rhizomatous perennial herb of non-calcareous marshy fields and streamsides, fen-meadows and mildly acidic bogs. It shows a preference for waterlogged areas subject to lateral water movement, giving slight base-enrichment. Seed can be persistent in the soil. Lowland.|Native|There have been many losses due to habitat destruction, especially through agricultural intensification, and this trend has continued in recent years. However, H. undulatum is much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas. There is a herbarium specimen from Ireland (Glengarriff, W. Cork) but it may be mis-labelled.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Hypochaeris glabra|An annual of open summer-parched grasslands and heathy pastures, on usually acidic, nutrient-poor, sandy or gravelly soils; also occurring in dune grassland and on sandy shingle. It was formerly widespread as a weed of arable fields, and as a wool-shoddy alien. Lowland.|Native|H. glabra is declining in semi-natural habitats, even though there have been many new records since it was mapped by Stewart et al. (1994). It has been lost from some squares as a result of agricultural improvement or loss of grazing. It can easily be overlooked, however, particularly as the flowers close in the afternoon.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Hypochaeris maculata|A perennial herb confined to free-draining, usually base-rich substrates. It occurs on chalk and limestone downland, on coastal cliffs over limestone and serpentine, and on wind-blown calcareous sand on the N. Cornwall coast. In Jersey, it grows on exposed granite cliffs. Lowland.|Native|This species is now known from only half the sites recorded in the 19th century. These losses, all inland, have been due to habitat destruction by ploughing, or lack of grazing followed by invasion of coarse grasses and scrub. Whilst two of the remaining sites each have over a thousand plants, three sites have fewer than ten.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Hypochaeris radicata|A perennial herb of meadows, pastures, lawns, heathland, cliff-tops, sand dunes, roadsides, railway banks and waste ground, on slightly acidic, usually free-draining soils. It is very tolerant of drought, and is absent from sites subject to prolonged waterlogging. 0-530 m (S. of Garrigill, Cumberland), and to 610 m on Macgillycuddy`s Reeks (S. Kerry).|Native|There has been no discernible change in the range of H. radicata since the 1962 Atlas. It was first recorded in Shetland in 1889.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Iberis amara|An annual, rarely biennial, herb of bare, open ground on S.-facing slopes on chalk, being found in bare places in grassland, particularly rabbit scrapes, and in quarries. It also occurs as an arable weed, and as a casual in a wide variety of ruderal habitats. Lowland.|Native|Rabbits were important in maintaining an open habitat for this species, and after myxomatosis some sites were lost. However, seed is apparently long-lived, and plants can reappear in native sites following disturbance or clearance. Many alien records may be misidentifications of the similar I. umbellata.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Ilex aquifolium|An evergreen shrub of deciduous woodlands, especially those on acidic soils in which Fagus and Quercus predominate; often a frequent or locally dominant undershrub but rarely dominating the canopy. Its susceptibility to browsing can limit regeneration. It is also found in wood-pasture, scrub and hedgerows, and on ledges of acidic cliffs, and is often planted in amenity areas and parkland. 0?600 m (Eel Crags, Cumberland).|Native|Widespread planting has completely obscured the native distribution of this species and all records are mapped as if they are native. There is little change in its overall distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Illecebrum verticillatum|An annual of periodically wet or inundated acidic to neutral soils on gravelly tracks, pool and ditch margins, in very short heathy swards and grassland; also recorded on clinker in railway sidings. Lowland.|Native|This species was not recorded in Hampshire until 1920 and it appears to have spread steadily in the New Forest since 1950. Cornish populations remain fairly stable, with most losses there having occurred before 1930. Old records from the Outer Hebrides have not been confirmed but subfossil pollen has recently been discovered there, suggesting that they may be correct (Whittington & Edwards, 2000).|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Impatiens capensis|An annual, thoroughly naturalised by rivers, canals and adjacent reservoirs. The seeds can be ejected from its capsules to a distance of a few metres, and can be dispersed by water. Lowland.|Neophyte|Introduced probably in the very early 19th century, the first record of I. capensis outside cultivation was from Surrey in 1822. There has since been a steady expansion into semi-natural habitats, which still continues. The Norfolk population originated from an independent introduction to a tributary of the Bure near Aylsham in 1927 (Petch & Swann, 1968).|Native of North America; also naturalised in France and Germany, although on a smaller scale than in our area.
Impatiens glandulifera|This species is most frequent on the banks of waterways, where it often forms continuous stands, but is also established in damp woodland, flushes and mires. The tallest annual in Britain, its rapid growth can shade out even Urtica dioica. Lowland.|Neophyte|I. glandulifera was introduced as an ornamental garden plant in 1839 and was first recorded in the wild in 1855 (Middlesex). It became naturalised independently in many different places, but did not attain its most rapid rate of increase until almost a century later. There has been a significant increase in its frequency since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of the Himalayas; widely naturalised in temperate Europe.
Impatiens noli-tangere|Our only native Impatiens is an annual plant of nutrient-rich soils in damp but not waterlogged woodland, occurring on streamsides and in valley-side seepages. Lowland.|Native|The species has not shown any significant change in its native distribution in Britain over a long period, and remains rare and local. Most non-native records are probably of short-lived casuals, and it appears now to be rarely cultivated.|Eurasian Temperate element; also in western N. America. The British sites for this species are amongst several scattered western outliers detached from its continuous range from C. Europe eastwards.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Impatiens parviflora|This species is usually found as a well-naturalised alien in semi-natural woodland and plantations, especially along tracks, but it also occurs in N. and W. Britain along shaded river banks, and in E. Scotland on unshaded river shingle. There are also scattered records of casual plants in timber yards. Lowland.|Neophyte|I. parviflora was introduced in 1823. It was recorded in the wild in England in 1851 (Surrey), and in Scotland in 1864. Since then it has increased steadily.|Native of C. Asia; widely naturalised in temperate Europe, all European populations possibly originating from a single introduction.     © P. Shannon
Inula conyzae|A biennial or perennial herb of dry sites, mainly on chalk or limestone, less frequently on sands and gravels, typically in places where the vegetation cover is broken or in areas of open soil or stony ground. It occurs in dry grassland, on banks, woodland margins, rides and scrub, in quarries and pits, screes (but rarely on cliffs), on the more vegetated parts of sand dunes, on roadsides and rough ground. Most sites have a southerly aspect and are unshaded. 0-305 m (Kingsdale, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of I. conyzae since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; it reaches its northern limit in Jutland.
Inula crithmoides|A perennial herb of two distinct types of habitat. On sea-cliffs it grows on ledges, in crevices and in open turf on calcareous or base-rich rocks, where it is often rooted in soil enriched with calcareous shell sand. In S.E. England it also occurs in saltmarshes, growing in low-marsh sites on coarse sand and above this on moderately organic soils, frequently where drift-litter accumulates. Lowland.|Native|This species is much better recorded now than in the 1962 Atlas. Its distribution is stable, with most losses from outlying squares having occurred in the 19th century.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; it reaches its northern limit in Scotland.
Inula helenium|A rather robust, conspicuous and persistent perennial herb, widely if sparsely established from garden outcasts on road- and lane-sides and by woodland margins, but seldom far from habitation. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|I. helenium has been grown in gardens for its medicinal and ornamental value since at least 995 (Harvey, 1981). It is very persistent but it may be in gradual decline.|Native of W. & C. Asia; widely naturalised in temperate Europe and elsewhere.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Inula salicina|This perennial herb is known only from the northern half of Lough Derg, where it has been recorded along the limestone shoreline and on the islands, occupying an intermediate, stony habitat between the flood level and the surrounding scrub. Lowland.|Native|Populations of I. salicina have progressively declined. It disappeared from the S.E. Galway side of Lough Derg in the 1960s and there is now only one population in N. Tipperary. Its decline has been tentatively attributed to increased eutrophication of the lake and lake shore. It has been transplanted to one former native site.|Eurasian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Iris foetidissima|A perennial herb, highly tolerant of drought and shade, found in hedge banks and woods, and on sheltered scrubby sea-cliffs, mostly on calcareous substrates. Reproduction is by seed and by rhizomatous extension. Lowland.|Native|The native range of I. foetidissima is much obscured by garden escapes and introductions. It is treated here as alien throughout Ireland. Its overall distribution has not changed since the 1962 Atlas, although it is now much better recorded.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Iris germanica|A rhizomatous perennial herb found in rough and waste ground, on roadsides and railway banks and in derelict gardens. It rarely produces seed in Britain, but spreads vegetatively. Lowland.|Neophyte|I. germanica has been grown in gardens since at least 995 (Harvey, 1981). It is frequently cultivated in gardens and becomes naturalised when planted or discarded in suitable habitats. It has been known in the wild since at least 1905.|This cultivated species is probably a hybrid of garden origin, but if so its parentage is very obscure.
Iris pseudacorus|A rhizomatous perennial herb of wet meadows, wet woods, fens, the margins of lakes, ponds and watercourses, wet dune-slacks, and, in N. and W. Britain, also of coastal streams, shingle, upper saltmarshes and raised beaches. It reproduces by seed and by vegetative spread. Plants have occasionally been planted in the wild or have escaped from cultivation. Generally lowland, but reaching 480 m at Nenthead (Cumberland).|Native|The 10-km distribution of I. pseudacorus has been stable since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Isatis tinctoria|A biennial or perennial herb, found only in ruderal habitats such as quarries, bare cliffs, arable fields, docks and waste places. It is usually casual, but persists at a few sites including Guildford, Surrey (first recorded in 1814) and Tewkesbury, E. Gloucs. (1818). Lowland.|Archaeophyte|I. tinctoria has been used as a dye plant in Britain since the Iron Age. In the 1930s, however, the world`s last two woad mills, in Lincolnshire, were closed and since then it has been a rare casual.|I. tinctoria sens. lat. is widespread across Eurasia; subsp. tinctoria may be native to S.W. Asia but is now widely naturalised in Europe. It is expanding around the Baltic coast.
Isoetes echinospora|A submerged aquatic perennial usually found in nutrient-poor lakes over a wide range of substrates, from rocks and stones to silt and peat. It also grows in more mesotrophic water, such as coastal lakes enriched by wind-borne base salts, lowland reservoirs, slow-flowing rivers and flooded gravel- and clay-pits. It often grows with I. lacustris, and not infrequently hybridises with it. 0-500 m (Loch Callater, S. Aberdeen).|Native|I. echinospora is now known from many more sites than in the 1962 Atlas, and probably remains under-recorded.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.
Isoetes histrix|A small, summer-deciduous perennial, growing from a `corm`. It prefers skeletal acidic soils that are moist or flooded in winter but experience summer drought. A poor competitor, it is most frequent on pans of bare soil over S.-facing rock outcrops, but also grows on erosion pans and footpaths. It sometimes occurs in short turf, and in dune-slacks in Guernsey. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of this species is stable. A few sites have been lost due to a lack of grazing, to fire and to conversion to cultivation, but it has colonised areas from which turf has been stripped.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © Shannon, P
Isoetes lacustris|A submerged aquatic perennial found in oligotrophic lakes with a rocky or skeletal substrate. It frequently forms extensive lawns of many square metres at depths up to 2.5 m and rarely deeper (6 m in Loch Lundie, Westerness). I. lacustris also occasionally colonises artificial reservoirs. 0-850 m (Carn nam Sac, S. Aberdeen).|Native|I. Iacustris was under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas, and may still be so in some areas. There is little evidence of change in its actual distribution, although a few lowland sites have been lost through agricultural eutrophication.|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element; also in N. America.
Isolepis cernua|A perennial found in wet, coastal grassland, in bare or open sites over damp sand, peat and mud, in short turf and sometimes in flushes and trickles on rocky cliffs. In the New Forest (S. Hants.), where it is locally common, it occurs inland in flushed acidic or base-rich turf and in old marl-pits. Lowland.|Native|Some sites for I. cernua were lost before 1930, but the distribution appears to be little changed since the 1962 Atlas, though the recording of this inconspicuous species has improved.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; also in N. America.     © F. Cameron
Isolepis setacea|A perennial herb of open, damp, generally acidic sites, especially those subject to winter flooding. It occurs on sandy or gravelly tracks, on the shores of lakes or ponds, in short grassland, on eroding streamsides and occasionally on the coast in sand dunes or in turf in the upper zones of saltmarshes. 0-590 m (High Cup Nick, Westmorland).|Native|I. setacea was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that most of the lowland losses have occurred since 1950, probably as a result of drainage. It is, however, a pioneer species of disturbed ground and can be easily overlooked.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Jasione montana|A biennial herb of acidic, shallow, well-drained soils. It occurs on sea-cliffs, in maritime grasslands and heaths and on stabilised sand dunes, and inland on heathland, stone walls, hedge banks and railway cuttings. Propagation is by seed and disturbed, open sites and recently burnt ground are frequently colonised. 0-955 m (Mt Brandon, S. Kerry).|Native|Many sites in C. and E. England were lost before 1930, and J. montana has further declined in the English Midlands and S.E. England since the 1962 Atlas. Reasons for losses include the loss of lowland heaths and the growth of coarser vegetation following a decline in rabbit grazing. Its distribution is more stable in Ireland.|European Temperate element.
Juglans regia|A large deciduous tree, commonly planted in urban areas and sometimes also in the wild in secondary woodland and hedgerows, and on river banks, field-borders and roadsides. It is often self-sown or buried by grey squirrels, especially in the south and west, with plants appearing on waste ground, in copses, rough grassland, gravel-pits and on railway embankments. Lowland.|Neophyte|J. regia has been grown in British gardens since Roman times and was certainly present by 995 (Godwin, 1975; Harvey, 1981), but it was not recorded formally in the wild until 1836. Its distribution is likely to be stable.|Thought to be native of S.W. & C. Asia, perhaps west to the Balkans; widely planted elsewhere.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Juncus acutiflorus|This species is usually tall and erect, and more extensively rhizomatous than J. articulatus. It occurs in wet or damp habitats on acidic soils, frequently at a lower pH than is tolerated by J. articulatus, particularly in damp meadows and pastures, marshes, bogs, wet heathland, and by ditches and ponds. 0?685 m (Mangerton, S. Kerry).|Native|J. acutiflorus was under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas. It often closely resembles the more robust growth-forms of J. articulatus and this might have produced some inaccuracies in the records of both species. However, they are both so frequent that this would be unlikely to affect the distributions shown on the maps.|European Temperate element; also in N. America.
Juncus acutus|A tall, tussock-forming perennial herb typically occurring in saline or brackish dune-slacks, in the uppermost levels of dry saltmarsh and on shingle banks. There is often little competing vegetation. Lowland.|Native|J. acutus seems to be an efficient coloniser and, in Britain, sometimes quickly appears in newly available sites. There have been very few 10-km square losses since the 1962 Atlas. Local losses have resulted from sea-defence works or changing coastlines.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; also in western N. America.     © L. Rooney
Juncus alpinoarticulatus|This montane, rhizomatous herb occurs in rather open wet turf in marshes and flushes and by lakes and streams, usually on base-rich soil and often over limestone. It is often found with a range of other less common montane calcicoles in bryophyte-rich habitats. From 150 m near Pitlochry (E. Perth) to 880 m on the Ben Alder range (Westerness).|Native|J. alpinoarticulatus has been much confused with variants of J. articulatus, and sometimes grows and hybridises with them. New finds in recent years are due to better identification skills rather than to natural range extension.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Juncus ambiguus|This dwarf, annual, spring-germinating member of the J. bufonius aggregate occurs in bare damp brackish places near the coast and sometimes inland, often with J. bufonius. It is typical of coastal mud- and sand-flats above high-water mark and of the margins of saline and brackish lakes, and is also found on bare mud and waste ground associated with inland salt-flashes and salt-workings, and on highly basic lime-waste tips. Lowland.|Native|J. ambiguus was not separated from J. bufonius in Britain until 1978 and is often confused with variants of J. bufonius. It is almost certainly still under-recorded, especially in Scotland and W. Ireland.|European Southern-temperate element; also in N. America.
Juncus articulatus|This very variable, erect to decumbent, clumped to extensively rhizomatous herb is found in a wide range of wet or damp habitats, both freshwater and brackish. It is characteristic of damp fields, marshes, ditches, flushes, rutted woodland rides, margins of ponds, lakes and streams and dune-slacks, avoiding only the most acid soils. 0-810 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|There is no change in the overall range of J. articulatus since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Juncus balticus|J. balticus usually grows in dune-slacks and other damp areas in maritime sand, mud or peat, frequently beside river estuaries, in open or closed vegetation. The plant is rhizomatous and rarely forms dense patches. It also occurs inland in N.E. Scotland on river-terraces or flood plains or in marshes. Generally sea level, but reaching 405 m on Slochd Mor (Easterness).|Native|The distribution of J. balticus seems stable, and it is probably still present in many of its Scottish sites that have no post-1986 records. There has been an increase in abundance in its very restricted sites in S. Lancashire over the past thirty years.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Juncus biglumis|This short, tufted perennial herb occurs in damp rocky or gravelly places, ranging from well-watered rock faces and flushes to marshes with short open vegetation. It is confined to base-rich, but relatively competition-free, habitats in species-rich localities. From 460 m on Rum (N. Ebudes) to 1100 m in the Breadalbanes (Mid Perth) and Aonach Beag (Westerness).|Native|J. biglumis is probably present in most of its pre-1987 sites, and new sites have been found in N.W. Scotland. Its distribution is stable. Old records for Upper Teesdale are considered doubtful in the absence of convincing herbarium material.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Juncus bufonius|An annual of habitats where the water-table is at least seasonally high and there is little competition, including the margins of ponds, lakes, streams and rivers, marshes and dune-slacks, and rarely acid bogs. It also grows around brackish lakes and on estuarine mud- and sand-flats, and is often a weed of disturbed ground, including tracks and roadsides. 0?595 m (Mangerton, S. Kerry).|Native|J. bufonius sens. str. was not separated from other members of the J. bufonius aggregate until 1978, and it is under-recorded in some areas. It is, however, the most frequent species of the aggregate, and probably occurs throughout the range of J. bufonius sens. lat.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Juncus bufonius sens.lat.|These annuals are found in a wide variety of habitats which are moist or flooded in winter, and where there is some disturbance and little or no competition. This includes the edges of ponds, lakes and marshes, dune-slacks, estuaries, saltmarshes, sandy seashores, and tracks and gateways. 0?595 m (Mangerton, S. Kerry).|Native|The range of J. bufonius sens. lat. is stable. Although the taxonomy of the British and Irish species included in the J. bufonius complex (J. ambiguus, J. bufonius sens. str. and J. foliosus) was elucidated in the 1970s and 1980s, they remain under-recorded as some botanists only record the aggregate.|The distribution of the segregate species is given in the following accounts.
Juncus bulbosus|A very variable herb, ranging from tufted, terrestrial plants to submerged, floating aquatics, often rooting at the nodes and with proliferating flowers. It occurs in or by water and in open, often seasonally wet habitats, in acidic to neutral soils. Unusually, it grows in some calcareous turloughs in the Burren. 0-960 m (Caenlochan, Angus).|Native|The distribution of J. bulbosus is stable, with slight declines at the edges of its range. Some authorities recognise two segregates (J. bulbosus and J. kochii), but opinions differ widely on their taxonomic status and distribution.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.
Juncus capitatus|A diminutive, autumn-germinating annual of barish ground often kept open by standing water in winter and always droughted in summer. It grows around serpentine rock outcrops, on ledges of granite sea-cliffs, in dune-slacks and sometimes in quarries. Lowland.|Native|Populations vary greatly in size from year to year, and reports of extinction have sometimes proved to be premature, notably on Anglesey where it was re-discovered in 1995. The main threat to the Cornish sites is the cessation of grazing.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Juncus castaneus|This short, tufted perennial herb often occurs in species-rich localities with one or both of J. biglumis and J. triglumis, although it is more characteristic of wetter and more calcareous habitats, and can better withstand competition from grassy vegetation. From 610 m on Sgurr na Lapaich (Easterness) to 990 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|J. castaneus might still be present in some of its pre-1987 sites, but few of these have been updated since it was mapped by Stewart et al. (1994). Since many populations are small and often in sites where there is heavy grazing, there is some cause for concern.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Juncus compressus|A compact to spreading, rhizomatous perennial herb found in marshes, wet meadows and pastures, often near the sea and sometimes in brackish conditions, occasionally with J. gerardii. 0-370 m (above Dent station, N.W. Yorks.).|Native|J. compressus has always been confused with J. gerardii, especially on the coast. It could well be under- or over-recorded. Many recent county floras record a decline because of drainage and the loss of permanent pastures. Conversely, it has appeared in new sites on the edges of reservoirs. It is mapped as native in Ireland, but its status there is uncertain (Scannell & Synnott, 1987).|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Juncus conglomeratus|J. conglomeratus tends to occur in slightly drier habitats than J. effusus, avoiding the wetter places and the more acidic soils, being characteristic of damp fields, ditches, open woodland and margins of still or running water. 0-840 (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth), and 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|Despite the well-documented differences between J. effusus and J. conglomeratus, they are still frequently confused. The latter species might be over-recorded, but this is unlikely to affect the map which indicates a stable distribution.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Juncus effusus|J. effusus occurs by rivers, ponds and lakes, and in marshes, wet fields, ditches and open wet woodland. It avoids base-rich soils and is most characteristic of sandy and peaty substrates, especially open heaths and moors, where it can be dominant. 0?845 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland) and 850 m Co. Wicklow.|Native|The range of J. effusus is unchanged since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element; also disjunctly in C. and E. Asia and N. America and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Juncus filiformis|A rhizomatous perennial herb, restricted in Britain to the edges of lakes or reservoirs, mostly in a narrow fringing zone of periodically flooded wet marshy pasture or more open ground. Lowland.|Native|J. filiformis is evidently effectively dispersed, as it can appear in newly available habitats far from known sites. It is, however, very easily overlooked due to its thin, often short (and heavily grazed) stems rather sparsely distributed on extended rhizomes, and for this reason may be somewhat under-recorded. It was known from only five squares outside the Lake District in the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Juncus foliosus|This spring-germinating annual is the most robust member of the J. bufonius aggregate, occurring in wet fields, marshes and ditches and on the muddy margins of lakes and ponds, sometimes with J. bufonius sens. str. Although often found near the coast, this species seems to shun brackish water. 0-365 m (Corndon Hill, Monts.).|Native|J. foliosus was recognised in Britain as a subspecies in 1959 but did not become widely known until Cope & Stace (1978) treated it as a species. It is almost certainly under-recorded. However, the current map indicates a predominantly south-western distribution which fits in with its wider European range and is almost certainly a true reflection of reality.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Juncus gerardii|This species is apparently confined to saline habitats, mostly in the uppermost parts of coastal saltmarshes, but also around coastal rock pools, in spray-drenched cliff-top turf and at saline sites inland. Lowland, although unintentionally but successfully introduced with other halophytes on a bank below a roadside car park at 575 m at the Hartside Cafe, Cumberland (Corner, 1997).|Native|There is little change in the overall distribution of J. gerardii since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element.
Juncus inflexus|A clump-forming perennial herb of wet places by rivers, ponds and lakes, and in marshes, wet fields, ditches and occasionally dune-slacks and fens. It is almost always on base-rich soils, frequently on heavy clays, where it replaces J. effusus. 0-550 m (Mattergill Sike, Westmorland).|Native|There is no change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas. The absence of J. inflexus from some areas of England, Wales and Ireland indicates a lack of sufficient base-richness, whereas most of Scotland lies beyond its northern limit in Europe.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Juncus maritimus|A rhizomatous, clump-forming perennial herb of saltmarshes and saline dune-slacks. It also occurs in areas subject to freshwater seepage on low, exposed rocky cliff-tops and stony sea-loch shores. It is tolerant of a wide range of salinities and soil moisture, occurring at all levels in saltmarshes and in both silty and sandy substrates. Lowland.|Native|J. maritimus has been lost since the 1962 Atlas from a number of sites on the S. and E. coasts of England, but the distribution is stable elsewhere.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Juncus pygmaeus|This diminutive, loosely tufted, spring-germinating annual occurs in seasonally wet, compacted open ground such as in gateways and on wheel tracks, less often in natural areas of erosion and in quarries, on serpentine heathland. Lowland.|Native|Populations of J. pygmaeus vary greatly in size from year to year, but there has been a strong decline since 1950, mainly due to tracks becoming abandoned and vegetated over, or infilled with hardcore.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Juncus squarrosus|A wiry, tufted perennial herb which is characteristic of wet peaty heath and moorland, raised and valley mires and upland flushes on acidic substrates. 0-1040 m (Carrantuohill, S. Kerry).|Native|J. squarrosus has been lost from many sites in S. and E. England since the 1962 Atlas, due to drainage and agricultural improvement. The distribution is stable elsewhere.|Suboceanic Temperate element; also in Greenland.     © L. Rooney
Juncus subnodulosus|A strong, rhizomatous perennial herb growing in dense stands in fens, marshes, wet meadows, ditches and by water, usually in more base-rich conditions than any of the other jointed-rushes (sect. Septati); it also sometimes occurs in brackish water. Lowland.|Native|J. subnodulosus has been lost from many sites in S. England both before 1930 and subsequently, because of drainage of its habitat. However, it is now known to be more frequent in Wales than was suspected. This species is very distinct from other jointed-rushes and the map should indicate its true distribution.|European Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Juncus tenuis|A slender, tufted perennial herb found in damp open ground by roads and lakes, on paths and in woodland and forest rides. 0-430 m (above Dent station, N.W. Yorks., and in the Caulderbeck Fells, Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species was first recorded from Angus in the 1790s, but did not begin to spread widely until the late 19th century. Claims for native status in Ireland are unproven. It has consolidated rather than extended its range since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of N. & S. America.
Juncus trifidus|A small, densely tufted perennial herb found in bare or bryophyte- or lichen-rich places on mountains on shallow soil or in rock crevices, on both acidic and calcareous substrata. J. trifidus is one of the principal angiosperms of wind-swept, often almost snow-free plateau edges over c. 1000 m, but it also occupies sites that are snow-covered for several months. From 240 m on Ronas Hill (Shetland) to 1310 m in the Cairngorms.|Native|The distribution of J. trifidus is stable.|Eurosiberian Arctic-montane element; also in N. America.     © Pete Stroh
Juncus triglumis|A short, tufted, montane perennial herb of base-rich damp rocky or gravelly places, flushes and small marshes with little competing vegetation. It occupies the same habitats as the rarer J. biglumis, and often grows near or with it, but is less restricted to high altitudes, descending from 1065 m on Snowdon (Caerns.) to, formerly, 60 m in Shetland.|Native|J. triglumis was lost from Orkney and Shetland before 1930. The overall distribution elsewhere has changed little since the 1962 Atlas, and it is probably still present in those squares where it has not been seen since 1987.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.     © Pete Stroh
Juniperus communis|J. communis is a dioecious evergreen conifer found on basic and acidic soils in a wide range of habitats, including chalk downland, heather moorland, oceanic heaths, rocky slopes and in Betula, Quercus and Pinus woods. Regeneration is inhibited by continuous grazing. 0-975 m (Braeriach, S. Aberdeen).|Native|The decline in S. Britain was already apparent in the 1962 Atlas and since then losses in other areas have become apparent. Burning has largely eliminated it on grouse moors, and the scrub communities in which it regenerates have declined severely due to grazing, burning, succession to woodland and afforestation.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Kickxia elatine|An annual of basic soils, including light soils over chalk and calcareous boulder-clay, found on the headlands and margins of arable fields (particularly cornfields), and less commonly on tracks, waste ground and in gardens. It is also found on sandy soils, and has been recorded on open peaty ground (Co. Cork). Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Although this species is often only present in small and scattered populations, its overall distribution shows only limited losses. Simpson (1982) suggests that some Kickxia seeds germinate in late summer and may therefore escape herbicides.|As an archaeophyte K. elatine has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Kickxia spuria|An annual of arable land and open waste ground, usually on calcareous soils, in similar habitats to K. elatine and often growing with it. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Like K. elatine, this species has a similar range to that mapped in the 1962 Atlas. Although both species are often thought to be declining, they have never been abundant weeds and the distribution may be more stable than is often supposed.|As an archaeophyte K. spuria has a European Southern-temperate distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Knautia arvensis|A perennial herb of calcareous and neutral grassland on well-drained, especially basic soils. It is found in chalk and limestone grassland, in rough pasture, open hedgerows and wood borders, and as a colonist on roadside verges, railway embankments and grassy waste ground. It is also a locally common weed of cultivation, especially in field-borders on the chalk. 0-365 m (Derbys.).|Native|K. arvensis was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that most of the losses have occurred since 1950. It is included in some wild-flower seed mixtures.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Kobresia simpliciuscula|A densely tufted perennial herb of open situations, occurring in stony flushes, base-rich mires and wet, grassy or sedge-rich turf on limestone or calcareous mica-schist. Generally montane, occurring as low as 360 m in Teesdale (N.W. Yorks.) but reaching 1065 m on Meall Garbh (Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of K. simpliciuscula is stable. Even when common, however, it is easy to overlook and it probably still occurs in most sites for which there are only pre-1987 records. Some populations are very extensive with tens of thousands of plants.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Koeleria macrantha|A perennial herb of grasslands on infertile, mainly calcareous substrates; also around rock outcrops, screes, quarry heaps and old lead workings. In many areas it is most frequent in dry, sandy, base-rich grassland on cliff-tops and dunes. Generally lowland, but reaching at least 680 m on Mt Brandon (S. Kerry).|Native|The map suggests little appreciable change in the distribution of K. macrantha since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`, but K. macrantha is known to have declined in many squares due to habitat destruction and intensification of grassland management.|Circumpolar Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Koeleria vallesiana|A tufted perennial grass of open, sheep-grazed turf around rock outcrops on S.-facing Carboniferous limestone slopes. Its sites are characterised by high levels of insolation and summer drought. Lowland.|Native|In the British Isles K. vallesiana has always been restricted to the Mendip hills (N. Somerset). It was first collected in this area in 1726, but not recognised until it was rediscovered by Druce in 1904. It was introduced to Goblin Combe (N. Somerset). Its distribution is stable.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Koenigia islandica|A tiny annual of bare, intermittently flushed or constantly moist, basaltic gravel pans and screes, mainly with a northerly or easterly aspect. Frost action and wind erosion assist in keeping the habitat open. 300-715 m near summit of Storr, Skye (N. Ebudes).|Native|The species was first collected in Britain in 1934 and not correctly identified until 1950. There has been no change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas, but severe declines in some populations on Mull (Mid Ebudes) since 1994 are linked to unusually dry weather over several years, especially in the spring.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Laburnum anagyroides|A small tree, much planted in parks, gardens and on waysides, thriving mainly on acid soils and frequently self-seeding into waste ground and by roads and railways. In W. Britain it was formerly used in hedging, and persists locally. Generally lowland, but reaching 425 m near New Radnor (Rads.).|Neophyte|L. anagyroides was introduced into cultivation in Britain before 1596 and was known from the wild by 1879. The likely explanation for the huge increase in records since the 1962 Atlas appears to be the increased interest in recording alien trees.|Native of the mountains of C. Europe.
Lactuca saligna|This autumn- or spring-germinating annual occurs on disturbed, sandy shingle and old sea walls, growing on sparsely vegetated ground; also formerly on the banks of rivers and ditches in East Anglia, and, rarely, on paths and cliffs in Essex. Lowland.|Native|L. saligna has suffered a severe decline owing to sea-wall refurbishment and river engineering. It was extinct at about half its known sites by 1930, and survived in East Anglia until 1953. Inundation by sea water caused a dramatic decline in the present Sussex population in the 1990s, but the Essex population is thriving, and benefits from cattle grazing. It was re-found on the Isle of Grain (W. Kent) in 1999.|European Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Lactuca serriola|An annual or biennial herb of roadsides, waste ground, gravel-pits and sea walls, often rapidly colonising newly turned soil. Also occasionally in semi-natural habitats, such as shingle banks and sand dunes. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|L. serriola, first recorded in Britain in 1632, spread rapidly during the 20th century, often with road development. Since the 1962 Atlas it has spread northwards and westwards, and greatly consolidated its range. It was first recorded in Ireland in 1996.|As an archaeophyte L. serriola has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © P. Shannon
Lactuca virosa|An annual or biennial herb, sensitive to grazing, occurring as a native on coastal cliffs, inland rock outcrops and perhaps sand dunes, but much more widespread as a plant of rank calcareous grassland, woodland margins, road-banks, quarries, tracks and rough ground. Lowland.|Native|L. virosa was first recorded in Britain in 1570 but it was often recorded in error for L. serriola forma integrifolia before 1930, so it may have been rarer then than records suggest. Road development has greatly assisted its spread since 1980. Recorders have not distinguished the alien sites and all records are therefore mapped as if they are native.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Lagarosiphon major|L. major is a submerged aquatic which grows in standing waters, including lakes, ponds and flooded mineral workings, and in canals. It may be abundant in small ponds. Only female plants have been recorded, and reproduction is by vegetative fragmentation. Lowland.|Neophyte|This commonly cultivated aquatic was first recorded as naturalised in Britain in 1944. Although it was not common enough to map in the 1962 Atlas, it has spread in recent decades, probably from the initial release of discarded material from garden ponds or aquaria into the wild and subsequent vegetative spread.|Native of southern Africa; locally established in Europe and extensively naturalised in New Zealand.     © G.

Lamiastrum galeobdolon||||
Lamium album|A rhizomatous or sometimes stoloniferous perennial herb of secondary woodland, hedge-banks, waysides and rough ground, often growing on fertile soils close to habitation. 0-345 m (Garrigill, Cumberland).|Archaeophyte|There is no evidence for an overall change in the range of L. album since the 1962 Atlas.|As an archaeophyte L. album has a Eurasian Boreo-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © P.

Lamium amplexicaule|An annual of open, cultivated and waste ground, usually found on light, dry soils. It also occurs on walls, by railways and in cracks in pavements. 0-455 m (Atholl, E. Perth).|Archaeophyte|Although now much better recorded than it was in the 1962 Atlas, the map suggests a slight decline in this species, especially in S. England and N.E. Scotland. It is decreasing as a weed of cultivated land because of the increased use of herbicides (Brewis et al., 1996).|As an archaeophyte L. amplexicaule has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © P.

Lamium confertum|An annual of cultivated and waste ground. Generally lowland, but formerly recorded as a casual at 320 m in Derbyshire.|Archaeophyte|The map suggests a decline in the frequency of L. confertum in Scotland. Elsewhere, the decline apparent in the 1962 Atlas has continued; naturalised populations no longer exist in England, where it is now present only as a casual.|As an archaeophyte L. confertum has a European Boreal-montane distribution; it also occurs in Greenland.
Lamium hybridum|An annual of cultivated, waste and disturbed ground on dry soils, often occurring as a weed of heavily fertilised, broad-leaved crops. 0-320 m (Derbyshire).|Archaeophyte|L. hybridum shows a considerable increase in distribution compared with the 1962 Atlas, presumably due to its ability to exploit conditions of high fertility. However, it is often confused with L. purpureum, so may previously have been under-recorded. It is possibly still overlooked in some areas, and may be more common than the current map suggests.|As an archaeophyte L. hybridum has a European Temperate distribution.
Lamium maculatum|This rhizomatous or stoloniferous perennial herb is naturalised on rough ground, rubbish tips, roadsides and waste places, usually close to habitation. Generally lowland, but recorded at 490 m above Garrigill (Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species was introduced into cultivation from Italy in 1683, and recorded in the wild by about 1730. It is still widely grown as a garden plant. It is certainly increasing in many areas.|A European Temperate species, absent as a native from much of W. Europe.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Lamium purpureum|This annual is a frequent colonist of fertile and disturbed soils, and is found in cultivated and waste ground, gardens, hedgerows, on roadside verges, along railways, around rock outcrops and in rough grassland. 0-610 m (Grasshill, Co. Durham).|Archaeophyte|As in the 1962 Atlas, L. purpureum is present in nearly all lowland areas but the map suggests a decline in Scotland, possibly due to the abandonment of marginal arable land.|As an archaeophyte L. purpureum has a European Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Lapsana communis|An annual to perennial herb, typically occurring in disturbed and shaded places, and thriving over a wide range of soil acidity and moisture. Habitats include open woodland, scrub, hedgerows, waste and cultivated ground, railway banks, roadsides and old walls. 0-440 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Native|There has been no discernible change in the range of L. communis since the 1962 Atlas.

Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Larix decidua|A deciduous tree of plantations, shelter-belts and parkland, grown in open situations, but not in very dry or waterlogged sites. It regenerates from seed freely, especially onto disturbed soil or rocky ground, and may become naturalised on crags. 0?660 m (S. of Garrigill, Westmorland).|Neophyte|L. decidua was introduced to Britain by 1629, and was formerly much grown in plantations. It was first recorded from the wild in 1886. It was greatly under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas. Though still planted for its timber, it is susceptible to larch canker and other species are now generally preferred.|Native to the Alps and Carpathians; widely planted elsewhere.
Larix decidua x kaempferi (L. x marschlinsii)|A deciduous tree of plantations and woodland. It is fertile and can back-cross with either parent, and regeneration from seed is frequent. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Neophyte|This hybrid has proved to be a very vigorous tree. F1 plants are much favoured for forestry and are widely planted. It was not recorded from the wild, however, until 1983. Its distribution is very similar to that of L. kaempferi; both taxa are widespread but under-recorded.|A hybrid tree which often originates when the parents are grown together, as at Dunkeld where it arose in about 1897 and was first noticed in 1904.
Larix kaempferi|This tree is planted mainly as a forestry crop, but is also found in parks and large gardens. It grows in open situations, but does not thrive in either dry or waterlogged sites. Regeneration from seed can be frequent. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Neophyte|Introduced to Britain in 1861, this species is less susceptible than L. decidua to larch canker, grows faster and tolerates poorer ground. It is therefore preferred by foresters, and is widely planted for timber, especially fencing. It was known in the wild by at least 1957. Like L. x marschlinsii, it is under-recorded.|Native of Japan; widely planted in N.W. Europe.
Lathraea squamaria|An annual or perennial herb, parasitic on the roots of a range of woody plants, especially Corylus, Fraxinus and Ulmus glabra. Its typical habitats include deciduous woodland, hedgerows, and river and stream banks. Generally lowland, but reaching 350 m at Alston (Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of L. squamaria is similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas. There have been 10-km square losses throughout its range, the reasons for which are unclear.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Lathyrus aphaca|The only persistent populations of this annual are in open grassy habitats on chalk, limestone and calcareous clay soils, especially near the coast. The species is possibly native in such habitats, but it also occurs as a casual in waste places, and as an arable weed where it may have been introduced as a contaminant of legume crops. Lowland.|Native|L. aphaca was first recorded in 1632. It can be difficult to distinguish between possibly native and introduced populations. Its distribution is stable in its persistent sites; many losses are referable to casual records.|Submediterranean?Subatlantic element; also in C. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lathyrus japonicus|A long-lived perennial herb, forming large and conspicuous patches on shingle beaches, or rarely, in smaller quantities on blown sand. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of L. japonicus is stable within its core areas, although some populations in the north and west are transient, perhaps arriving as drift seeds from America, or reappearing after long intervals from buried seed.

Lowland.|Native|There has been a considerable increase in 10-km square records since the 1962 Atlas, particularly in C.S. and S.E. England. Several recent county floras suggest that it is spreading in ruderal situations, and there are also records from restored open-cast mine sites where it may have been introduced as a constituent of commercial seed mixtures. It is unclear whether recent records in N.W. England are introductions or represent a northerly expansion of its native range.|European Temperate element.
Lathyrus palustris|A perennial herb of base-rich fens, reed-beds and fen-meadows; also, rarely, on marshy ground by rivers. Lowland.|Native|L. palustris was lost from many sites in E. England before the end of the 19th century, and is still declining there due to drainage and lack of management. New populations have been discovered in Wales and Kintyre since 1970. One of these, which grew at Tywyn Burrows (Carms.) but has since disappeared, was the American var. pilosus, which probably originated as a drift seed. L. palustris is thought to be increasing in Ireland and is certainly better recorded there than in the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Lathyrus pratensis|A rhizomatous perennial herb of moderately fertile soils on roadside and railway banks, hedges, unimproved pastures, hay meadows and other grassy habitats. Seed production is not abundant, and vegetative propagation from the rhizome is an important mechanism of reproduction, particularly in disturbed sites. Generally lowland, reaching 450 m in Co. Durham, and with an exceptional record at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of L. pratensis appears to be stable.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lathyrus sylvestris|A scrambling perennial herb found in hedges, wood-borders, scrub, and on rough banks and sheltered sea-cliffs. It is sometimes cultivated in gardens and can occur as an escape in habitats such as roadsides and railway banks. Away from the coast it seems to prefer calcareous soils. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of L. sylvestris is stable. It is often difficult to know whether inland populations are native or alien and some of those mapped in the English Midlands may only be casual.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lathyrus tuberosus|A scrambling perennial herb of hedgerows, rough grassland and waste places; also occasionally found in arable field margins where its tubers allow it to persist. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. tuberosus was being cultivated in gardens by 1596, but it is a common cornfield weed in Europe and may have been introduced before this date as a seed contaminant.

Laurus nobilis|A dioecious evergreen shrub or small tree, arising from bird-sown seed or found as a garden throw-out in woodland and scrub and on sea-cliffs, dunes, roadsides and river banks; it also occurs as a relic of cultivation. Many populations are well-naturalised and reproduce from seed, especially those on coastal cliffs. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species, very popular in gardens for its aromatic leaves, has been cultivated in British gardens since at least 995 (Harvey, 1981). It may fruit prolifically, especially in hot summers, although many plants are highly pruned and may not fruit freely. It was not recorded in the wild until 1924, but appears to be increasing.|Native of the Mediterranean region.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Lavatera arborea|A monocarpic herb, rarely native more than 100 m from the coast. It usually grows in shallow, nutrient-enriched soils, occurring most frequently amongst vegetation in sea-bird roosts, and on ground enriched by garden waste. Plants are killed by severe frost and the species is therefore restricted to mild micro-climates near the sea. Lowland.|Native|It is difficult to define the native range of L. arborea, as it is taken from the wild into gardens in some areas and escapes from gardens in others. Although there are local losses, these are more than offset by the spread of plants from coastal gardens into nearby ruderal habitats.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Lavatera cretica|An annual or biennial herb occurring in mostly open habitats near the sea, including bulb fields, old quarries, roadsides and disturbed ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. cretica was introduced to cultivation in Britain in 1723. It has apparently increased in frequency in Guernsey in the 20th century. In the Isles of Scilly its range has not changed markedly since its discovery in 1873, and its population appears to be relatively stable at present. It occurs only sporadically in W. Cornwall. Some authorities regard L. cretica as a native in the Channel Islands and S.W. England, but it is treated here as an introduction.|L. cretica has a Mediterranean-Atlantic distribution.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Leersia oryzoides|A rhizomatous perennial herb of nutrient-rich mud around the cattle-trampled margins of lakes and ponds, in ditches, on canal banks and riversides; also formerly in wet meadows. Lowland.|Native|L. oryzoides has decreased since the 1962 Atlas. Several populations have been lost in the last twenty years, including those in Somerset which were last seen in the early 1990s, and it is now apparently restricted to just three native sites in S.E. England, though it has been re-introduced into two others. The drainage and infilling of ponds and ditches, and possibly the over-zealous maintenance of canal banks, are thought to have contributed to its decline.|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia and N. America.
Legousia hybrida|This annual of arable fields is usually found on calcareous soils, especially on chalk. Outside its core areas, it occurs as a casual in disturbed sites such as motorway embankments. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|L. hybrida has significantly declined since the 1940s because of the use of herbicides and changing methods of arable cultivation. However, the seed is long-lived and populations can reappear after long periods of absence.|As an archaeophyte L. hybrida has a European Southern-temperate distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Lemna gibba|This buoyant duckweed is a plant of still or slowly flowing, eutrophic water in ponds, canals, ditches or the quiet backwaters of rivers; it can also grow in brackish water. In very eutrophic sites it may form dense masses which exclude other aquatics. It reproduces by vegetative budding, though it flowers slightly more freely than our other Lemnaceae. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of this species is similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas. It was then described as `casual only in Scotland` but it is now frequent in the Forth & Clyde and Union Canals, where it may have arrived by natural dispersal.|European Southern-temperate element; also in C. Asia and N. America.
Lemna minor|This is our most widespread and frequent floating aquatic plant, often abundant on a wide variety of still or slowly flowing, mesotrophic or eutrophic waters. It also occurs terrestrially on exposed mud, or damp stonework and rocks. Plants rarely flower and reproduction is by vegetative budding. 0-500 m (Brown Clee Hill, Salop).|Native|There is no evidence that the distribution of this species has changed since the 1962 Atlas, as the overall range is similar and the extra squares in which the species is known have almost certainly resulted from more detailed recording.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Lemna minuta|L. minuta occurs, often in abundance, as a floating aquatic on the surface of lakes, ponds, slowly flowing rivers, streams, canals and ditches. It is sufficiently shade-tolerant to occur on ponds shaded by marginal trees or woodland. Reproduction is by vegetative budding. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was first recorded in Britain in 1977, when it was discovered in Cambridge, and it has spread rapidly especially since the late 1980s. It is probably under-recorded, as it is easily overlooked as L. minor. It was first found in Ireland at Blarney Castle (E. Cork) in 1993 and Ballyconnell (Co. Sligo) in 1995.|Native to temperate and subtropical N. & S. America; now widely naturalised in Europe where it was first discovered in France in 1965.
Lemna trisulca|The only submerged species of Lemna in our area, L. trisulca is frequent in mesotrophic to eutrophic, still to slowly flowing waters where low nutrient levels or exposure prevent the development of a dense blanket of floating Lemna species. Reproduction is by vegetative budding; flowering is very rare. Generally lowland, but reaching 340 m at Kingside Loch (Selkirks.).|Native|There have been some local losses, but the distribution of L. trisulca is otherwise stable.|Circumpolar Temperate element.
Leontodon autumnalis|A perennial herb of meadows and pastures, open scrub, heaths, moorland, saltmarshes, fixed dunes and roadsides in the lowlands, and also of screes, flushes and lake margins in the uplands. 0-975 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|L. autumnalis is tolerant of trampling and competes well in taller vegetation. It has increased on roadsides, but its overall national range is stable. It is very variable, with several ecotypes ranging from tall, hairy plants on montane cliff ledges to small, virtually glabrous plants in saltmarshes.|European Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Leontodon hispidus|A perennial herb of dry, neutral or calcareous soils, occurring in hay meadows, pastures and other grasslands, on roadside verges, railway banks, rock ledges and in quarries. It readily spreads by wind-dispersed seeds into open habitats. 0-575 m (Harwood Dale, Cheviot) and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|There has been no discernible change in the distribution of L. hispidus since the 1962 Atlas. It is possibly over-recorded in some areas in error for L. saxatilis; almost all Scottish Highland records have been treated as dubious. Almost or wholly glabrous plants (var. glabratus) occasionally occur.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Leontodon saxatilis|A perennial or biennial herb of often heavily grazed and trampled grassland, dry moorland, stony banks, limestone and other basic rock outcrops, fixed dunes, tracks, and sand- and gravel-pits. It prefers well-drained, calcareous to mildly acidic soils, but also occurs in periodically wet habitats such as dune-slacks, rutted tracks and pond margins on sandy soils. 0-500 m (Brown Clee Hill, Salop).|Native|L. saxatilis was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It is now much better recorded but has apparently declined in some areas since 1950. It can be confused with L. autumnalis and L. hispidus.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lepidium campestre|An annual, or occasionally biennial, herb of open grassland and arable fields, particularly on sandy or gravelly soils; also found on roadsides and walls, in gardens and waste places. It is often persistent, but occurs just as frequently as a casual. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|L. campestre was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that most of the losses have occurred since 1950, with a marked decline in some areas.|As an archaeophyte L. campestre has a European Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Lepidium draba|A perennial rhizomatous herb of roadsides, and on dry limestone or clinker ballast of railways. It also grows on waste ground, in arable fields on light soils, on sand dunes and other sandy ground, particularly near the sea, and in the uppermost zone of saltmarshes. Lowland.|Neophyte|Accidentally introduced to Swansea (Glamorgan) in 1802, and subsequently to other ports, L. draba spread rapidly in the 19th century, particularly in urban and industrial areas. Its range has expanded in Britain since the 1962 Atlas, but not in Ireland.|Native of S. Europe and S.W. Asia; naturalised throughout temperate W. Europe, N. America and the S. hemisphere.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Lepidium heterophyllum|A perennial, or rarely biennial, herb of acidic soils in dry heathy and gravelly places. It is also frequent on shingle, railway ballast and embankments, and, less commonly, in arable fields. It is tolerant of grazing. Generally lowland, but reaching 425 m (Sow of Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|L. heterophyllum was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There is little evidence of any change in its distribution except in S.E. England where it appears to be decreasing.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Lepidium latifolium|A rhizomatous perennial herb native on creek-sides, ditches, sea-walls, open brackish grassland and the upper fringes of estuarine saltmarshes. It is also naturalised in disturbed areas such as waste ground, dockland, railways and roadsides. Lowland.|Native|L. latifolium was cultivated up to the 17th century as a hot flavouring before Armoracia rusticana was used for that purpose. Its ruderal habitat and the persistence of relics of cultivation make its native range difficult to delimit. The coastal distribution remains stable, but there are many more inland records than in the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lepidium ruderale|An annual, or rarely biennial, herb of banks and bare waste land near the sea, and of salted road verges. It is also frequent as a casual of roadsides, rubbish tips, gardens and waste places. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|L. ruderale is increasingly found as a halophyte along trunk roads, but is apparently less frequent as a casual than it was before the Second World War.|As an archaeophyte L. ruderale has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Leucanthemum lacustre x maximum (L. x superbum)||||
Leucanthemum vulgare|A perennial herb found in many grassy habitats, especially meadows and pastures which are cut or moderately grazed, preferring well-drained, neutral to base-rich soils; also on coastal cliffs, stabilised dunes, waste ground, by railways and newly sown roadsides. It can quickly colonise open ground. 0-845 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|Throughout much of its range this species has been spread by human activities, sometimes being sown in grass mixtures. However, the map suggests a decline in Scotland, presumably in semi-natural habitats.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.
Leucojum aestivum|A bulbous perennial herb, occurring as a native mostly in winter-flooded riverside Alnus or Salix carr, but occasionally found in other damp habitats such as meadows and woodland rides. It also occurs as a garden escape near habitation and on rubbish tips. Lowland.|Native|L. aestivum subsp. aestivum is native in some areas and subsp. pulchellum is an alien (which was in cultivation by 1596) but they have long been confused and the true subspecific identity of some records is in doubt. However, the presumed native distribution of subsp. aestivum in Britain and Ireland is stable. As aliens, both subspecies readily become naturalised in suitable situations and appear to be increasing.|European Southern-temperate element.     © David Roy
Leucojum vernum|A bulbous perennial herb of damp soils, thoroughly naturalised in woodland and scrub, by watercourses and in grassy places. Lowland.|Neophyte|Although sometimes considered native at two localities in S.W. England, all British populations are almost certainly relics of cultivation or result from surplus garden plants being discarded into suitable habitats; it was being cultivated in Britain by 1596 and was first recorded in the wild in 1866. There has been little change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|A European Temperate species, absent as a native from much of W. Europe.
Leycesteria formosa|A deciduous shrub, locally established as a garden escape in woodland, hedgerows, shrubberies and on waste ground. It is sometimes planted as cover for pheasants, and also arises from bird-sown seed. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was introduced into cultivation in Britain in 1824, and was known from the wild by at least 1905. Its range is said to be increasing nationally (Clement & Foster, 1994) and locally (Bowen, 2000; French et al., 1999), but the species was not mapped for the 1962 Atlas, so such trends are difficult to assess.|Native of the Himalayas.
Leymus arenarius|A rhizomatous perennial herb growing on coastal sand dunes, sometimes also on fine shingle; it is well known as an important species in the stabilisation of mobile dunes and widely planted as a sand binder. It is a rare casual or naturalised garden escape inland. Lowland.|Native|There is no evidence of appreciable change in the distribution of L. arenarius since the 1962 Atlas, though there are some losses in S. England. The widespread planting of L. arenarius on eroding dunes appears to have had little impact on its overall distribution.|European Boreo-arctic Montane element; also in E. Asia and N. America.
Ligusticum scoticum|A perennial herb of coastal rock crevices and free-draining skeletal soils by the sea. Habitats include cliffs, rocky shores and platforms, spray-drenched shingle, stabilised sand dunes and stone sea-defence walls. The seeds float and retain some viability even after a year in sea water. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of L. scoticum in Scotland is little changed, but there are losses in N. Ireland, some since the 1962 Atlas. Drought sensitivity and the requirement for cold, wet conditions for germination may be important in limiting the southern range of this species in our area.|European Boreo-arctic Montane element; a coastal species also found in E. Asia and N. America.
Ligustrum ovalifolium|A semi-evergreen or evergreen shrub, abundantly planted for hedging and found as a persistent relic in old gardens, or a garden throw-out in hedges, rubbish tips, waste land and on railway banks. Plants very occasionally arise from bird-sown seed. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. ovalifolium has been cultivated in Britain since 1842, and was first recorded from the wild in 1939. Trends in its distribution are difficult to assess, but it is probably increasing through the continued disposal of garden rubbish. It is unevenly recorded.|Native of Japan.
Ligustrum vulgare|A deciduous to semi-evergreen shrub found as a native in hedgerows, woodland and scrub, preferring well-drained, calcareous or base-rich soils. It is also often planted, particularly in hedges and woodland, and occurs as a garden escape and a relic of cultivation. 0-490 m (Craig y Cilau, Brecs.).|Native|There has been no significant change in the native range of L. vulgare since the 1962 Atlas, although alien records are mapped here for the first time. It can be difficult to decide if some populations are alien or native; in Ireland it is mapped as alien but may be native at some coastal sites. Some records may be errors for L. ovalifolium.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lilium martagon|A bulbous perennial herb, usually occurring in small clumps near woodland edges or in coppiced woodland. It may be abundant in newly coppiced areas. It is also known from less natural sites, including old orchards and derelict gardens. The seeds are wind-dispersed but the bulbs may be carried by jays. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. martagon was introduced into British gardens by 1596. It was first recorded in the wild in 1782, and not until 1883 in the Wye Valley, where it was once considered to be native in ancient woodland. There is little evidence of significant distributional change since the 1962 Atlas.|A Eurosiberian Temperate species; naturalised in N. Europe north of its native range.
Limonium auriculae-ursifolium|"An apomictic perennial herb, now restricted to a single locality (Plémont Point, Jersey) where it grows in rock crevices on the side of a bare granite gully. It used to occur at a second site on Jersey (Rouge Nez), on nearly inaccessible cliffs. Lowland.

Limonium binervosum||||
Limonium binervosum agg.|A group of apomictic perennial herbs comprising the following nine species and numerous infraspecific taxa, many of which are British and Irish endemics. They occur in a wide range of coastal habitats including sea-cliffs, dock walls, shingle banks and saltmarshes. Lowland.|Native|Many of the taxa included here were not recognised at the time of the 1962 Atlas. However, the map shows that there has been no appreciable change in distribution of the aggregate in the last 30?40 years. Most colonies occur in places unlikely to be damaged by human activities, although losses from some artificial habitats have been noted.|The aggregate has an Oceanic Temperate distribution.
Limonium britannicum||||
Limonium dodartiforme|A perennial herb found mainly on chalk sea-cliffs, but with a few small outlying populations on stabilised shingle (Chesil Beach), on limestone at Lulworth and on Purbeck, and on breakwaters in Portland Harbour (all in Dorset). Lowland.|Native|This taxon was not recognised at the time of the 1962 Atlas and there are no indications of any recent changes in its distribution.|Endemic.
Limonium humile|A perennial herb of ungrazed or lightly grazed muddy estuarine saltmarshes, often growing in close proximity to its commoner relative, L. vulgare, but replacing it in some areas. It rarely occurs on rocky cliffs. Lowland.|Native|There has been very little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas, though a few local losses have been noted as a result of land-use changes or invasion by Spartina. Intermediates between L. humile and L. vulgare are frequent (including the hybrid L. x neumanii), and some populations are difficult to assign to either species.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Limonium loganicum|A perennial herb of granitic sea-cliffs, coastal rocks and screes. Lowland.|Native|This taxon was not recognised at the time of the 1962 Atlas. It is thought to be one of the most endangered of the members of the L. binervosum aggregate. The short stretch of coastline on which it occurs is a popular climbing resort and many colonies are small and vulnerable to trampling.|Endemic.
Limonium normannicum|"A perennial apomictic herb of stabilised sand dunes (St Ouen`s Bay, Jersey) and coastal rocks (St Esquère Bay, Alderney), in the latter site growing with L. binervosum subsp. sarniense. Lowland.
 



      Trends    

Native. L. normannicum was first distinguished as a separate taxon in 1985, having previously been included within L. auriculae-ursifolium.

Limonium paradoxum|A perennial herb restricted to a single site where it occurs on basic igneous rock outcrops, along the seaward edge of cliff-tops and on inaccessible cliff ledges. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of L. paradoxum has remained largely unchanged since the species was first described in 1931, and the population size has been remarkably stable for at least the last twenty years.

Limosella aquatica|An annual of the muddy edges of rivers, lakes, reservoirs, pools, ditches, rutted tracks and roadsides. In the Burren (Co. Clare) it also occurs in limestone solution hollows. It may prefer mildly acidic, nutrient enriched soils. Plants reproduce by seed and also spread by stolons. 0-455 m (Malham Moor, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|Though this species is erratic in appearance, there have been many losses, mainly before 1930 but still continuing. Reasons for this include drainage, the infilling of ponds, and lack of grazing. The remarkable increase in Scottish records since the 1962 Atlas may result from better recording or a genuine spread.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Limosella australis|An annual to short-lived perennial of mudflats and saltmarsh pools, occurring as scattered plants or in dense swards. Reproduction by seed occurs, but plants spread mostly by stolons. Lowland.|Native|This species was first recorded in 1897 in Glamorgan, but colonies in S. Wales had probably died out by the 1940s. It was not found in N. Wales until 1921. It can be locally abundant, but numbers fluctuate markedly annually. It has been suggested that it might be a recent arrival, or even a ballast-alien (Jones, 1991), but the evidence for this is inconclusive.|Oceanic Boreo-temperate element; in Europe restricted to Wales, but widespread in coastal regions of eastern N. America.
Linaria pelisseriana|An annual of hedge banks, rough ground and rocky places. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. pelisseriana was first cultivated in Britain in 1640. It was recorded from the wild in Jersey in 1837, where it was seen sporadically at scattered localities until 1955. It is often regarded as a native to the island, but its history suggests that it is more likely to be an alien. It is only casual elsewhere.|A Mediterranean-Atlantic species.
Linaria purpurea|A perennial herb, occurring as a garden escape or outcast on waste ground, roadsides and banks, along railways, on pavements, walls and rubbish tips, and in quarries. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. purpurea was introduced into cultivation by 1648 and is a popular garden plant with several named cultivars. It was known from the wild by c. 1830 (Middlesex), and its distribution has greatly increased since the 1962 Atlas, probably due to both better recording and a genuine spread.|Native of C. & S. Italy and Sicily.
Linaria repens|This rhizomatous perennial herb is found on rough and waste ground, stony and cultivated land, grassy banks and along railway tracks, usually on dry, calcareous or base-rich soils. 0?335 m (near Brassington, Derbys.).|Archaeophyte|There are many more records now of L. repens than in the 1962 Atlas, but the overall range is unchanged. It has gone from some 10-km squares, perhaps reflecting the tendency for it to behave as a transient colonist of open habitats.|As an archaeophyte L. repens has a Suboceanic Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Linaria vulgaris|This perennial herb is found in open grassy places, on stony and waste ground, hedge banks, road verges, railway embankments and cultivated land, especially on calcareous soils. It reproduces by seed and also spreads by creeping rhizomes. 0-360 m near Alston (Cumberland).|Native|The overall range of L. vulgaris is stable, although there have been local losses in the north of its British range and in some areas of Ireland. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.     © P. Shannon
Linnaea borealis|A creeping perennial, woody at the base, of both native and planted Pinus sylvestris woodland, where it occurs in slight to moderate shade, on barish ground or leaf litter, sometimes with an acidic heathy herb flora. It spreads vegetatively and by seed, though seedling establishment seems largely restricted to disturbed ground. 0-730 m (Easterness).|Native|There were severe losses of L. borealis before 1930, mostly through the clearance of native woodland. It may still be decreasing, although it has been better recorded recently. All English records are probably introductions, perhaps with tree seedlings.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.     © Pete Stroh
Linum bienne|An annual, biennial or short-lived perennial herb of dry grassy places and grassland-scrub mosaics, chiefly near the sea; its habitats include cliff-slopes and coombes, path and field margins, roadsides, railway banks and old quarries. It appears to favour warm, sheltered, S.-facing slopes and relatively infertile, drought-prone soils. Lowland.|Native|L. bienne is much more frequent, or much more frequently recorded, than in the 1962 Atlas. The additional records are balanced by losses from some inland squares due to habitat destruction and intensification of grassland management.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Linum catharticum|An annual or bennial herb of dry, infertile calcareous or base-rich substrates, but also found in flushed sites on neutral or mildly acidic soils. It occurs in a wide range of calcareous grasslands, mires and flushes, in short-sedge fen-meadows, on outcrops and ledges of basic rock, road cuttings, quarry spoil and lead-mine debris, and very locally on dry heaths. 0-840 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|L. catharticum was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has probably declined in many areas, particularly in S. England where local losses are beginning to show at the 10-km square scale.|European Temperate element; also in N. America.
Linum perenne|A perennial herb, growing in open, well-drained situations on base-rich substrates, including lightly-grazed grassland, dry banks and roadsides. From near sea level in Kirkcudbrightshire to 340 m near Crosby Ravensworth (Westmorland).|Native|This species has become extinct at several localities in the last hundred years, but its current distribution is similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas. However, many surviving populations are very small and presumably vulnerable to land-use change.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution. The L. perenne group is taxonomically complex; our plant is subsp. anglicum which is a British endemic.     © Shannon, P
Linum usitatissimum|A robust annual found on road verges, rubbish tips and waste ground and locally, rather surprisingly, on stone reservoir banks. It is also a moderately frequent bird-seed alien. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. usitatissimum has been cultivated since at least 1240 (Harvey, 1981), and was formerly widely grown for fibre. Since the early 1990s it has been increasingly planted for linseed oil production. It was known from the wild by 1632 (Kent). Escapes from cultivation have become much more common, but are usually transient.|Originated in cultivation; perhaps derived by selection from L. bienne.
Liparis loeselii|In East Anglia this pseudobulbous perennial herb is restricted to species-rich fens on infertile soils, and to old peat cuttings. Elsewhere, it grows in young dune-slacks. Lowland.|Native|This species declined greatly, especially before 1930, due to habitat destruction and, in East Anglia, scrub encroachment and the cessation of peat cutting.

Listera cordata|A perennial herb found in moorland and on peat bogs, often growing in Sphagnum or in the moss layer beneath Calluna and Vaccinium, always in wet, acidic conditions. It also grows in moss in damp, heavily shaded wood-carr, and occasionally under Pinus. Reproduction is by seed and root-buds. 0-1065 m (Stob Coire an Easain, Westerness).|Native|Although lost from many lowland sites before 1930, presumably due to habitat destruction, this species is much better recorded than it was in the 1962 Atlas. It is an inconspicuous plant which may still be under-recorded.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © Pete Stroh
Listera ovata|A rhizomatous perennial herb found on a wide range of calcareous to mildly acidic soils. Its habitats include grassland, woodland, hedgerows, scrub, sand dunes, dune-slacks, limestone pavement and heathland; in Anglesey and Ireland it also grows in fens. It frequently occurs, sometimes as large colonies, on railway embankments and in disused quarries and sand-pits. 0-670 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, although some lowland sites have been lost to agricultural activities, including ploughing of grassland and hedgerow removal.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Lithospermum arvense|An annual of arable fields, occasionally found on waste ground and in other disturbed habitats, favouring light, dry, calcareous soils. Seed is short-lived and populations depend upon regular disturbance for survival. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Archaeological evidence suggests that this species has been an arable weed in Britain since the Bronze Age. It has declined substantially since the 1950s because of agricultural intensification, and in many areas it is now uncommon in arable fields. Seed can be transported with grain, resulting in casual populations outside its core range.|As an archaeophyte L. arvense has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Lithospermum officinale|A shortly rhizomatous perennial herb which grows in grassland, hedgerows and wood margins, mostly on base-rich soils. Lowland.|Native|There seems to have been something of a decline in this species in England since the 1962 Atlas. Most of the losses in Scotland and N. England occurred before 1930. It has been considered alien in Scotland, but its long occurrence (from 1764 in Angus) at some sites and its semi-natural, base-rich habitats (for example, rocky riversides and limestone scree) suggest otherwise.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Lithospermum purpureocaeruleum|A perennial herb with creeping woody stems occurring in chalk and limestone districts in two distinct habitats. Inland, it grows in woodland edges and rides, and on lanesides and banks in partial shade. On the coast, it is found amongst naturally dwarfed, open scrub on slumped cliffs, slopes and crags. It spreads by seed and from the stems rooting at nodes. It also occurs as a garden escape on roadsides and waste ground. Lowland.|Native|The native distribution of this species seems to have been more or less stable since 1930, though some populations have been shaded out in neglected or unmanaged woodland. It has increased as an alien since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element.
Littorella uniflora|A perennial herb of oligotrophic or mesotrophic waters, found in lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, ponds and winter-flooded dune-slacks, growing on stones, gravel, sand, peat, marl or soft mud. It grows to a depth of about 4 metres and can form a dense band in the draw-down zone around lakes and reservoirs. It reproduces by seed and vegetatively by rooting stolons. Seeds remain viable for decades. 0-825 m (Ffynnon Llyffant, Caerns.).|Native|Drainage had resulted in the loss of many lowland sites for L. uniflora before 1930, especially in S. England, and further losses have occurred since then. It is now much better recorded that it was at the time of the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Temperate element.
Lloydia serotina|A bulbous perennial herb confined to damp ledges and crevices of mildly acidic rocks, usually on N.- to N.E.-facing cliffs, frequently in shaded sites and often sheltered by overhangs. Seeds are rarely produced and most reproduction is by rhizome-like structures. 550-760 m (Snowdonia, Caerns.).|Native|L. serotina appears to be a glacial relic in the British Isles. Populations have long been restricted to relatively inaccessible ground, perhaps because of over-grazing by sheep, and have been further reduced by collection since its discovery in the late 17th century. They now seem stable.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element, but absent from the European Arctic and from eastern N. America.
Lobelia dortmanna|"A small, rosette-forming perennial herb of oligotrophic lakes with acidic substrates. It is slow-growing, with little ability to withstand shade or competition and is therefore confined to shallow water less than 2 metres deep. Reproduction and dispersal is by seed, which can remain viable for thirty years. 0–745 m (Llyn Bâch, Caerns.).
 



      Trends    

Native (change -0.05). L. dortmanna is still frequent in the north and west but has declined, largely before 1930, from the eastern edge of its range in both Britain and Ireland through eutrophication.

Lobelia urens|A rhizomatous perennial herb of rough pastures and grassy heaths. It is confined to infertile acidic soils that are often seasonally waterlogged. Reproduction is by seed, which may be long-lived, and germination seems to be stimulated by disturbance. Most populations fluctuate erratically in size. Lowland.|Native|L. urens has decreased gradually and it is now known from only six localities.

Lobularia maritima|An annual, biennial or perennial herb, naturalised on sea-cliffs, sand dunes and open ground near the sea, and occurring as a casual inland in a variety of waste ground habitats. It sets seed readily but persists only in mild regions. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. maritima was cultivated in Britain by 1722 and is very widely grown in gardens. It was known from the wild by 1807. It is now much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas, but is probably also increasing.|Native of the coasts of S.W. Europe and the Mediterranean region; naturalised elsewhere in Europe, especially in coastal areas.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Loiseleuria procumbens|This procumbent, calcifugous dwarf shrub is found on exposed, stony mountain heaths on dry ridges and plateaux. Reproduction is mainly by seed, but it also spreads by rooting of the procumbent stems. Generally found from 500 to 900 m, but descends to 240 m on Ronas Hill (Shetland) and reaches 1100 m on Ben Macdui (S. Aberdeen).|Native|The distribution of L. procumbens is essentially stable, and it is probably still extant in many of the 10-km squares for which there are no recent records.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.
Lolium multiflorum|An annual or short-lived perennial found in leys, on field margins, in gateways, along farm tracks, on roadsides and rough ground. It often persists for a few years, but rarely becomes naturalised. Generally lowland, but reaching 410 m above Garrigill (Cumberland).|Neophyte|L. multiflorum began to be used in quantity in agriculture after about 1830, and until recently it was often grown in temporary leys for hay or silage. It was known from the wild by 1840. Its range is similar to that in the 1962 Atlas, but it is more frequent in Ireland than previously thought.|Probably native of the Mediterranean region, but widely used for fodder and now widespread in Europe and other temperate regions.
Lolium perenne|L. perenne is predominantly a species of improved lowland pasture, leys, and hay meadows, but is found widely in other habitats, including downland, rush-pasture, inundated grasslands, amenity grassland and road verges; also in open ruderal habitats. It favours fertile, heavy, neutral soils, but is also found on those which are mildly acidic or basic. 0-570 m (Alston Moor, Cumberland).|Native|L. perenne has been cultivated since at least the 17th century, and cultivars developed by plant breeders are currently amongst the most commonly sown agricultural grasses. Its distribution is stable.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lolium temulentum|An annual, formerly often a persistent weed of arable land. It is now a rare casual of waste places, originating from grain, bird-seed and wool shoddy. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|L. temulentum, first recorded in Britain by 1548, was formerly a serious weed of arable land. It had almost disappeared from this habitat before the Second World War. It continues to be recorded as a casual, but less frequently now than in the 1950s and 1960s. It is sometimes toxic to humans and livestock (Cooper & Johnson, 1998).|Perhaps native of the Mediterranean region and S.W. Asia, but native range obscured by its spread with cultivation; once widespread in Europe and naturalised in Japan, N. & S. America, Australasia and elsewhere.
Lonicera periclymenum|A perennial deciduous twining shrub or woody climber, found in woodland, scrub and hedgerows, and on shaded rocks. It prefers freely-drained, moderately basic to acidic soils, but also grows on poorly-drained base-rich clays. 0-610 m (Fairfield, Westmorland, and in Co. Down).|Native|The current distribution of L. periclymenum is similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Lonicera xylosteum|A deciduous shrub, growing on basic or neutral soils in woodland, hedgerows and scrub, generally occurring in small populations. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. xylosteum was being cultivated in Britain by 1683. First recorded in the wild as a casual in 1770, it has been known from the chalk scarp of the South Downs near Amberley (W. Sussex) since 1801, where it grows in ancient woodland, hedgerows or scrub. Although arguably native at these localities, it is more likely to be an introduction (Webb, 1985). It was lost before 1930 from many sites where it is an undoubted garden escape.|A Eurosiberian Temperate species; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lotus angustissimus|An annual of thin, drought-prone soils on sea-cliffs, growing around rock outcrops, on sunny banks by tracks and footpaths, and in open areas amongst scrub. In Devon, it occurs in similar habitats inland. The outlying sites in Hampshire and Kent are associated with sand- and gravel-workings. It often grows with L. subbiflorus. Lowland.|Native|Recent surveys have shown that L. angustissimus is more widespread in Devon and Cornwall than was previously thought. However, many colonies are small and at risk from scrub encroachment. The persistent seed bank may enable it to respond to a resumption of grazing or disturbance.|European Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Lotus corniculatus|A perennial herb of grasslands, including well-drained meadows, chalk and limestone downs, hill pastures and montane rock ledges; also on coastal cliff-tops, shingle and sand dunes. It is absent from only the most acidic and infertile soils. Alien genotypes, introduced from seed mixtures, occur on roadsides. 0-915 m (Stuich an Lochan, Glen Lyon, Mid Perth).|Native|The overall distribution of this species is unchanged since the 1962 Atlas, despite the fact that it is suppressed in improved pastures and is possibly a poor competitor where grazing ceases.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lotus glaber|A perennial herb of coastal grazing marshes and sea-walls; inland it occurs in rough grassland, gravel-, sand-, chalk- and clay pits, and on railway banks and roadside verges. It is found on a range of neutral to calcareous soils, but shows a preference for estuarine silts and heavy clays. Lowland.|Native|On the coast the distribution of L. glaber appears to be stable, apart from losses in Devon and Cornwall where it may only ever have occurred as a casual. In many areas inland it is thought to be a casual or recent colonist of disturbed habitats, and the limits of its native range are not clear.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Lotus pedunculatus|A perennial herb of rushy pastures, wet meadows, marshes, ditches, the margins of lakes, ponds and rivers, wet road verges and other marshy places. It is probably more frequent on acidic soils than calcareous ones. Generally lowland, but reaching 490 m on Dartmoor (S. Devon).|Native|"The distribution of L. pedunculatus shows no change since the 1962 Atlas

Lotus subbiflorus|An annual or short-lived perennial herb typically occurring around rock outcrops and in dry, open grassland on coastal cliffs; often on relatively sheltered, sunny banks alongside cliff-top paths and trackways, and thriving on shallow, drought-prone neutral to moderately acidic soils. It often occurs with Lotus angustissimus. In Dorset, Hampshire and Wexford it occurs inland in open, sandy grassland and on verges. Lowland.|Native|This species is much better recorded than for the 1962 Atlas. Increasing scrub is restricting its habitats in Devon and Cornwall, but the seed seems viable for long periods and colonies can reappear when conditions improve.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © K.J.

Ludwigia palustris|A perennial herb found by or in seasonally-inundated pits or pools overlying base-rich clays. It also occurs in runnels within valley mires and in poached areas in pasture or woodland glades. Lowland.|Native|The range of L. palustris continues to expand in the New Forest (S. Hants.), where it benefits from disturbance by livestock but soon disappears when enclosed. The Dorset colony, found in 1996, has been confirmed as this species.

America and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Lupinus arboreus|A short-lived, semi-evergreen shrub, widely planted on sand dunes and (in Cornwall) on china-clay tips, where it can cover large areas by virtue of its copiously produced seed, which is long-lived. It also occurs on roadsides and railway banks and in waste places. Lowland.|Neophyte|When first introduced to cultivation in 1793, this species was thought to need greenhouse protection. It was known from the wild by at least 1945, and had become well established by the time of the 1962 Atlas. It has considerably increased its range since then, and is considered a threat to native vegetation in some areas, for example on sand dunes in Hampshire and Norfolk.|Native of western N. America (California).     © L. Rooney
Lupinus polyphyllus|A biennial or short-lived perennial herb, found on roadside and railway banks, river shingle, rubbish tips and waste places. Populations are often naturalised. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species, introduced to cultivation in 1826, is now rarely grown, its hybrid with L. arboreus (L. x regalis) being the common garden plant. For this reason it is likely that a large proportion of modern records, at least south of Scotland, are misidentifications of the hybrid. It was known in the wild by 1900.|Native of western N. America.
Luronium natans|A stoloniferous perennial of mesotrophic or oligotrophic lakes, pools and slow-flowing rivers, and abandoned or little-used canals. In deep water it persists as rosettes of submerged leaves, sometimes with cleistogamous flowers, but it produces floating leaves and flowers freely in shallower water or on exposed mud. 0-450 m (Bugeilyn, Monts.).|Native|In Britain, L. natans has been lost from many of its lowland sites because of eutrophication. However, some populations, particularly of the submerged form, have been overlooked until recently in both Britain and Ireland; it may still be under-recorded.|Suboceanic Temperate element.
Luzula arcuata|A dwarf, tufted, shortly rhizomatous and stoloniferous herb of bare windswept rocky summit ridges and plateaux that are mostly kept free of winter snow, where it often grows with Juncus trifidus. In high altitude corries it can occur in areas of snow-lie with greater vegetation cover. From 760 m (Slioch, W. Ross) to 1290 m (Cairn Toul, S. Aberdeen).|Native|L. arcuata has been found at new sites since the 1962 Atlas, but it seems likely there has been little change in its distribution, and it is probably still present in 10-km squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|European Arctic-montane element, but absent from mountains of C. Europe; also in E. Asia and western N. America.
Luzula campestris|An early-flowering, low-growing, tufted but shortly rhizomatous herb characteristic of short, unshaded, relatively infertile grassland. It is found in a range of grazed or mown, often trampled, grassy places, particularly pastures, meadows, grassy verges and lawns which are moderately acidic to slightly alkaline. Taller grassland, rocky ledges and slopes, and quarries and spoil heaps are also colonised. 0-1005 m (Carnedd Dafydd, Caerns.).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Luzula forsteri|A tufted, grass-like perennial herb of woods and other moist but well-drained shaded places, often on roadside banks and in hedgerows. It is most frequent on acidic soils, but avoids the most acidic. Competition is rarely tolerated, and plants usually occur in leaf-litter or moss-dominated sites. It often grows with L. pilosa, and appears to have very similar ecological requirements in S. England. Lowland.|Native|There have been some local losses of L. forsteri, particularly in S.E. England, but the overall distribution is stable.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Luzula multiflora|An early-flowering tufted but shortly rhizomatous herb of various grassy habitats, preferring more acidic soils and more shaded places than L. campestris. It occurs on heaths and moors and in the drier parts of bogs, in meadows and other grassy places, and in open woods and wood margins. 0-1020 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|Because of past and present confusion with L. campestris, it is difficult to assess the validity of the apparent decline of this species in C. &. E. England. Subsp. multiflora and subsp. congesta are difficult to distinguish and are unevenly recorded; they are not mapped here.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Luzula pallidula|A tufted but shortly rhizomatous plant of fens, open peat, and banks, rides and glades in damp peaty woodland, particularly in disturbed ground. Lowland.|Native|L. pallidula is possibly now extinct, having been last recorded in 1992 at Woodwalton Fen (Hunts.). However, it is likely that a soil seed bank still exists and this might give rise to populations following renewed peat disturbance. A record from Co. Antrim requires confirmation (Hackney, 1992).|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; also in N. America and widely naturalised outside its native range.
Luzula pilosa|A tufted, grass-like perennial herb of woods and other moist but well-drained shaded places, often on roadside-banks and in hedgerows, generally on fairly acidic soils but not confined to them. Plants usually occur in leaf-litter or moss-dominated sites, and competition is rarely tolerated. In upland areas, more exposed sites such as quarries, pastures and rough ground are occupied. 0-670 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. A decline, especially in C. & E. England, has taken place and analysis of the database reveals that most of these losses have occurred since 1950.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Luzula spicata|A dwarf, tufted, shortly rhizomatous and stoloniferous calcifuge of barish, open stony ground on mountains, both on flat areas and on cliffs and ledges, occasionally washed down rivers and on bulldozed hill tracks. It usually occurs in species-poor localities. From 275 m (Ronas Hill, Shetland) to 1220 m (Ben Macdui, Banffs.)|Native|There is virtually no change in the distribution of L. spicata. Two pre-1900 records from the Lake District shown in the 1962 Atlas are not supported by any herbarium material and are now considered dubious.|European Arctic-montane element; also in C. Asia and N. America.
Luzula sylvatica|Characteristic of a range of damp, acidic, usually shaded habitats, this rhizomatous patch-former is found in lowland woods, often beside streams, on peaty heaths and moors, and on rock ledges and rocky streamsides in mountainous regions. It is intolerant of grazing and it is often confined to woods or, in the uplands, rocks. 0-1040 m (Carrantuohil, S. Kerry).|Native|The distribution of L. sylvatica is stable, except in C. & S.E. England where it appears to have been lost from many sites before 1970.|European Temperate element.
Lychnis alpina|L. alpina is a montane rosette-forming perennial herb. In Angus, it grows on serpentine debris rich in magnesium and other metals, and in Cumberland on copper-rich soil over Skiddaw slate. Reproduction is exclusively by seed. At 600-700 m in Cumberland, and 870 m on Meikle Kilrannoch (Angus).|Native|There has been no change since the 1962 Atlas. Although regarded as an indicator of metal-rich substrates in Britain, it is not restricted to metalliferous soils in Scandinavia.|European Boreo-arctic Montane element; also in N. America.
Lychnis flos-cuculi|L. flos-cuculi is a herb of damp habitats, found in wet grassland, rush-pasture, fen-meadow, ditches, tall-herb fen and damp woodland margins. A dwarf form (var. congesta), known from exposed coastal grassland in E. Kent, Caithness, Sutherland and Shetland, apparently retains this character in cultivation. 0-750 m (Cross Fell, Cumberland).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of L. flos-cuculi since the 1962 Atlas, in which it was mapped as `all records`. However, many county floras record local declines due mainly to drainage and agricultural improvement of wet grassland.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Lychnis viscaria|A tufted evergreen perennial herb which grows on rocks and steep dry slopes of predominantly southerly aspect. It prefers mildly acidic to moderately basic soils and many stations are on the more basic volcanic rocks such as basalt and dolerite. From near sea level on undercliffs in Kirkcudbrightshire to 425 m at Kinloch Rannoch (Mid Perth); most populations are above 300 m.|Native|The losses shown on the map took place before 1930 and there has been no significant change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas. It is widely cultivated and sometimes escapes.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Lycium|The two supposed species of Lycium in our area (L. barbarum and L. chinense) are suckering, deciduous, spiny shrubs which are grown as hedges, particularly in coastal areas. Both grow readily from bird-distributed seed and become established on shingle, waste land, hedge banks and walls. 0?350 m (near Brassington, Derbys.).|Neophyte|The species were introduced before 1696, and they have always been confused in our area. Since many records are unreliable, both species are mapped here together. They have been recorded from the wild since 1848. There has been no change in the distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|Both L. barbarum and L. chinense are natives of China.
Lycium barbarum||||
Lycium chinense||||
Lycopersicon esculentum|A scrambling annual of waste ground, rubbish tips and sewage works. The species behaves as a perennial in its native range, but both the plant and, to a lesser extent, its seeds are frost-sensitive. Most populations are therefore killed each year, with new plants arising from seeds discarded as fresh fruit or from human sewage. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. esculentum was introduced into Britain by 1595, and is very widely cultivated. It was known from the wild by at least 1905. Casual plants have not been recorded systematically until recently and are still ignored by many recorders.|Native of C. & S. America; a frequent casual in Europe but not truly naturalised here.
Lycopodiella inundata|A prostrate perennial herb of wet, bare, peaty or sandy margins of lakes, pools, flushes and trackways. It can rapidly colonise substrates kept open by winter inundation, cattle poaching or peat cutting. 0-390 m (Llyn Cwmffynnon, Caerns.).|Native|Many sites for L. inundata were lost before 1930, and losses have continued due to drainage, a lack of grazing and other disturbance, and conversion to scrub, especially in England. However, it is easily overlooked and new sites have been found outside England since the 1962 Atlas.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in E. Asia and N. America.
Lycopodium annotinum|A sprawling, evergreen herb typically found on mountains and moorlands amongst deep Calluna on hill slopes, and sometimes in Pinus sylvestris woods. It usually grows on acidic peaty soils, often overlying boulders, or in hollows where snow accumulates. From 45 m on Mull (S. Ebudes) to 1000 m (Coire Cheap, Westerness).|Native|There have certainly been losses of this species over the past century due to changes in moorland management, although its distribution now appears to be stable. It may still be present in remote squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Lycopodium clavatum|A prostrate, evergreen perennial herb of heaths, moors and mountains. It is often frequent on base-rich micaceous soils, but also occurs on more acidic Calluna heath and Nardus grassland. Propagation is mostly vegetative, but spores can colonise new sites, particularly the disturbed soil of roadside embankments and quarries. Lowland to 840 m in Atholl (E. Perth).|Native|Many lowland sites of L. clavatum were lost before 1930. Populations elsewhere are somewhat transient, with losses owing to overgrazing, heather burning, conversion to scrub and agricultural improvement being offset by the establishment of new populations.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Lycopus europaeus|A rhizomatous perennial herb of wet habitats on organic and mineral soils, including the banks of rivers, streams, lakes and ditches, fens, fen carr, the top of beaches and dune-slacks. It is tolerant of temporary flooding, and is often an early colonist of exposed mud and shallow standing water in newly created wetlands. 0-485 m (Lochan Learg nan Lunn, Mid Perth).|Native|The current distribution of L. europaeus is apparently stable. Though the species may have disappeared from some sites as a result of drainage and clearance of watercourses, these losses are likely to have been balanced by colonisation of new sites, particularly gravel-pits.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lysichiton americanus|A perennial herb that is often planted beside ponds and streams in parks and gardens. It reproduces from seed and can quickly become established as an escape in carr and on swampy ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|L. americanus was introduced into cultivation in 1901 and was known in the wild by 1947 (Surrey). It is difficult to assess changes in distribution, but the species is likely to be increasing.|Native of western N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Lysimachia nemorum|An evergreen perennial of herb-rich, usually deciduous, woodland; also in old hedges, glades, damp grassland, fens and marshes, and shaded gullies and cliffs in upland areas. It is typical of mesic brown earth soils kept relatively open by slope, shade, vernal herbs and disturbance, and avoids places where litter accumulates. 0-820 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|Mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, analysis of the database reveals that the widespread decline of L. nemorum in S. England has taken place since 1950. Losses have resulted from woodland destruction and replanting with conifers.|Suboceanic Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Lysimachia nummularia|An evergreen perennial of open, damp, often clay-rich soils in shaded woodland and hedges, especially the sides of streams, and damp grassland and path-sides. It can spread rapidly from stem fragments. Seed set is rare, and some clones may be sterile. 0-365 m (S. of Buxton, Derbys.).|Native|L. nummularia is probably native in many southern sites, but is usually alien in the north. The limits of its native range are uncertain due to garden escapes, which can be well-naturalised.

Shannon
Lysimachia punctata|An evergreen perennial herb naturalised in rough grassland and on woodland edges, roadsides and waste ground. It spreads by short, thick rhizomes, but is apparently self-incompatible and rarely sets seed. Generally lowland, but reaching 430 m W. of Nenthead (Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species has been cultivated in British gardens since 1658. Its vigour means it is often thrown out with garden rubbish. It was recorded in the wild in 1853 (Angus), and is much more frequent now than shown in the 1962 Atlas.|Native of S.E. & E.C. Europe and W. Asia, east to Iran and the Caucasus; the western L. punctata and the eastern L. verticillaris do not appear to be specifically distinct.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Lysimachia thyrsiflora|The small colonies of this perennial herb grow in shallow water in permanently wet places. Typical habitats are fens on the flood plains of rivers, lake margins, ditches, canalsides and colliery subsidence ponds. Generally lowland, reaching 310 m at Lily Loch (Dunbarton).|Native|This species is maintaining its range in its Scottish strongholds, but in Yorkshire it has declined since the 1962 Atlas. These losses may be attributed to drainage and the degradation or loss of its habitat. It can be shy-flowering, and may be overlooked in places where it is infrequent.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Lysimachia vulgaris|A semi-evergreen perennial spreading vegetatively by very long thin rhizomes to form large colonies in permanently wet places on organic (less commonly, mineral) soils. Habitats include river banks and streamsides, marshes, tall-herb fens, fen-carr, ponds and ditches. It withstands some shade in wet open woodland. Lowland.|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that most losses, resulting from drainage and the clearance of watercourses, have taken place since 1950. It can, however, readily colonise suitable new sites, perhaps assisted by waterfowl.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Lythrum hyssopifolium|An annual of disturbed ground which is flooded in winter, including hollows and ruts in arable fields, and damp pastures disturbed in winter by numerous waterfowl. It sometimes occurs as a casual from seeds introduced with grain or from other sources. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|L. hyssopifolium has been rare since the middle of the 19th century. It may appear erratically at some sites, and can quickly colonise new ones, making trends difficult to judge. The population at Slimbridge (E. Gloucs.) was discovered in 1985 and had expanded by 1993 to an estimated 600[#]000 plants.|As an archaeophyte L. hyssopifolium has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Lythrum portula|An annual of acidic or calcium-deficient silty soils at the muddy margins of pools and in temporarily flooded habitats such as rutted tracks, woodland rides, heathland pools and the draw-down zone of reservoirs. It avoids the most acidic and nutrient-poor soils and is rarely found over peat. 0-460 m (source of R. Teme, Herefs.).|Native|L. portula was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that many losses have occurred since 1950. Reasons for this decline include ponds being drained or becoming overgrown, and rutted tracks being resurfaced or filled in. It is now much better recorded, particularly in W. Britain.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Lythrum salicaria|A perennial herb growing on the margins of slow-flowing rivers, canals, lakes, flooded gravel-pits, in tall-herb fens and willow carr. It thrives in permanently wet, or periodically inundated, fertile soils and tends to avoid acidic conditions. 0-440 m (Lake Ferta, S. Kerry).|Native|Although there have been local losses due to habitat destruction, this species is a good coloniser and can quickly become established in new sites. It is sometimes introduced to ponds and newly created wetlands. Its overall distribution is probably stable.|Eurasian Temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Mahonia aquifolium|An evergreen shrub which spreads rapidly by stolons and can become well established in hedgerows, road verges and woodland. Lowland.|Neophyte|M. aquifolium was introduced in 1823. It is commonly cultivated, and frequently planted in some areas for game-cover. It was known from the wild by 1874. It has increased since the 1962 Atlas, probably due to widespread planting and escapes from gardens.|Native of western N. America; widely naturalised in W. &. C. Europe.
Maianthemum bifolium|A rhizomatous, perennial herb of free-draining acidic soils in Quercus-Betula woodlands, but also persisting at sites replanted with conifers. Flowering and seed-set is poor. Lowland.|Native|M. bifolium was known in both cultivation and the wild by 1597. Records from the 17th century suggest that it was formerly more abundant and widespread, but extant populations tend to be isolated and very small, although stable. It is native or long-established in N. & E. England, and is usually short-lived at those sites mapped as alien, other than in Norfolk where it has been known since 1955.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Malus domestica||||
Malus sylvestris sens.lat.|These are small trees of hedgerows, scrub, copses, roadsides and rough ground, usually occurring as single trees. 0?380 m in Swindale (Westmorland).|Native|This map covers both the native M. sylvestris sens. str. (Crab Apple) and the alien M. domestica (Apple) and therefore equates to the map in the 1962 Atlas. Confirmed records of both taxa were mapped by Perring & Sell (1968). The two species hybridise and seem to be connected by a range of intermediates, which are included on the map. It can be difficult to separate native and alien populations, and all records are mapped as if they are native.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Malus sylvestris sens.str.||||
Malva moschata|A perennial herb of roadsides, hedge banks, woodland edges, pastures, field-borders, river banks and grassy waste places, preferring well-drained soils in unshaded or lightly shaded situations. It is tolerant of moderate levels of grazing or mowing, and seed is persistent in the soil. Predominantly lowland, but reaching 305 m at Scarth Nick (N.W. Yorks.), with an exceptional record at 845 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|M. moschata is native in S. England, but is probably introduced in N. Britain and Ireland. The distribution is stable, although it may be increasingly introduced with wild-flower seed mixtures and as garden escapes.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Malva neglecta|An annual which sometimes overwinters, occurring in waste places, gateways, paths, rough ground and on roadsides (often near habitation), occasionally on coastal drift-lines. It favours shallow, dry soils, and is tolerant of grazing and mowing, but not of competition with more vigorous species. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|M. neglecta was present in Britain in Roman times. It is often casual in N. England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that most of the losses have occurred since 1950, and it is probably declining in the west and north of its range.|As an archaeophyte M. neglecta has a European Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © Shannon, P
Malva pusilla|An annual of roadsides, farmyards, waste ground, gravel-pits, rubbish tips and foreshores. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species, first recorded in the wild in 1700, is usually a casual introduction with wool, grain and bird-seed, but populations sometimes persist. It appears to have declined recently and is now of only occasional occurrence.|A Eurosiberian Temperate species, extending west as a native to Scandinavia, Belgium and Italy.
Malva sylvestris|A drought-tolerant perennial herb of well-drained, often nutrient-enriched soils in unshaded situations, found on roadsides, railway banks, waste ground and field-borders, often near settlements, around farms and in the shelter of walls, occasionally on sea-cliffs. It reproduces freely from seed. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|There has been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|As an archaeophyte M. sylvestris has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © P. Shannon
Marrubium vulgare|A perennial herb, probably native only near the sea on open, exposed cliff-top grasslands and slopes overlying limestone and chalk, and on sandy banks and verges in Breckland. It is cultivated for tea and its medicinal properties, and is naturalised in rough and waste places; it also occurs as a wool-shoddy alien. Lowland.|Native|The distinction between native and alien populations, particularly in coastal areas, can be difficult. However, native sites seem to have declined since the 1962 Atlas due to lack of grazing, and its decline as an alien, already apparent by 1962, has also continued.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Matricaria discoidea|This annual of disturbed, usually fertile ground is found on roadsides, waste ground, tracks and in field gateways, and in arable crops. Generally lowland, but reaching 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Neophyte|Although cultivated in 1781, this species was first recorded in the wild in Britain as an escape from Kew Gardens in 1871 and in Ireland in 1894, and it became one of the fastest spreading plants in the 20th century. Its spread was aided by the transport of seeds on tyres and footwear. The distribution is now stable.|Probably native of N. & S. Asia and perhaps adjacent parts of N. America; in the 19th and 20th centuries it spread to boreal and temperate zones throughout the N. hemisphere.     © P. Shannon
Matricaria recutita|An aromatic annual of arable land, especially in cereal crops, and waste places. It usually occurs on light soils, but is sometimes found on loams and heavy clays. 0-365 m (Kirkstone, Westmorland).|Archaeophyte|It is difficult to account for the apparent increase in this species. In arable fields it has decreased because of herbicides, and is now more frequent in field gateways and margins than actually within the crop. However, it may now be better recorded. It is only casual in Scotland and Ireland.|As an archaeophyte M. recutita has a European Southern-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Matteuccia struthiopteris|A large deciduous fern found growing in damp woodland, by streams and lakes, and in fen carr under Betula. It tolerates a range of soil pH, but prefers waterlogged clay substrates. It spreads through the production of stolons. Lowland.|Neophyte|M. struthiopteris was introduced to cultivation in Britain in 1760 and is frequently grown for its distinctive shuttlecock shape. It has been known in the wild since at least 1834, and may be increasing through a rise in its popularity in water garden plantings.|A Circumpolar Boreal-montane species; absent as a native from much of W. Europe.
Matthiola incana|A short-lived perennial, well-naturalised on sea-cliffs, shingle and other habitats by the sea, and occasionally inland where it is more obviously a garden escape. Lowland.|Neophyte|M. incana has been widely cultivated in Britain since at least 1596, but may have been introduced long before that date. It has been considered to be native, but it was not recorded in the wild until 1808. It is now more frequent than when mapped in the 1962 Atlas.|A Mediterranean-Atlantic species; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Matthiola sinuata|A biennial or short-lived perennial herb of sand dunes and sea-cliffs. Most colonies are on young, fairly mobile dunes, and it has probably spread in the past by seeds floating in sea-water to new sites. Lowland.|Native|or alien. M. sinuata was first recorded in Britain in 1633. It seems to have declined slowly over the historical period, but its overall distribution is currently stable. However, large populations often disappear for reasons that remain uncertain; the species was thought to have become extinct in Glamorgan in 1848 until it was rediscovered there in 1964.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Meconopsis cambrica|A long-lived perennial herb, native in damp, rocky woodlands and on shaded cliff ledges. It is also grown in gardens and has become naturalised on hedge banks, walls, roadsides and waste ground. Native plants range from the lowlands to 640 m (Cwm Idwal, Caerns.).|Native|Native populations rarely spread into apparently suitable habitat and are probably in slow decline. In contrast, garden plants can spread rapidly and the species is increasing as an established alien. Within its core native areas, it can be difficult to separate native from alien occurrences, particularly in Ireland.|Oceanic Boreo-temperate element; confined as a native to W. Europe but widely naturalised outside its native range.
Medicago arabica|A winter-annual of grassy places, often on light, sandy and gravelly soils, particularly near the coast. It grows as a weed in lawns and frequently occurred as a casual in fields manured with wool shoddy. It is able to persist as small plants in mown lawns, and can grow as very robust plants in nutrient-rich habitats. Lowland.|Native|There has been a marked increase in M. arabica since the 1962 Atlas, particularly in S. England and the Midlands. Recent county floras suggest it has become more common in inland areas, for reasons that are not clear. For example, it was very rare in Oxfordshire before 1930, but is now widespread.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Medicago lupulina|An annual or short-lived perennial herb of dry grassland and disturbed places on relatively infertile neutral or calcareous soils; often in sunny S.-facing pastures and on roadside banks, waste places and walls. Its has a long-lived seed bank. Generally lowland, but reaching 440 m at Nenthead (Cumberland).|Native|The overall distribution of M. lupulina is stable. It declined during the 20th century in some areas of W. Scotland (Pearman & Preston, 2000) but some pre-1970 records in Scotland may result from confusion with Trifolium dubium.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.     © L. Rooney
Medicago minima|A winter-annual of dry, open, sandy or gravelly places; also occasionally found as a casual, introduced with wool shoddy. Lowland.|Native|M. minima is now less frequent on the coast due to habitat destruction and lack of grazing, allowing sites to become too rank for this low-growing species. It is now only rarely recorded as a casual.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Medicago polymorpha|An annual found in open sandy and gravelly habitats by the coast. It occurs in short, open grassland on summer-parched banks and cliffs with other annuals, particularly in S.W. England. Inland, like other Medicago species, it occurs as a casual, especially with wool shoddy. Lowland.|Native|M. polymorpha has declined at its coastal stations through scrub encroachment and lack of grazing, although it may be overlooked or confused with M. arabica. It is much scarcer nowadays as a casual inland.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © L. Rooney
Medicago sativa||||
Medicago sativa subsp.falcata|A perennial herb of grassy heaths, sea-walls, roadsides and tracks, chiefly found on calcareous soils and sands. It is often confined to the rear of roadside verges as it is sensitive to mowing. Lowland.|Native|This subspecies has declined on the coast and adjoining heaths through habitat loss. It is intolerant of livestock and rabbit grazing (Trist, 1979), and it hybridises with M. sativa subsp. sativa. Some of the casual records are probably variants of subsp. varia which approach subsp. falcata.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.
Medicago sativa subsp.sativa|A deep-rooted perennial herb naturalised on field margins, tracksides, rough grassland and waste ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|M. sativa subsp. sativa was first cultivated as a fodder and green manure crop in Britain in the 17th century and was recorded from the wild by 1804. It was more frequently grown in a period of world protein shortage in the 1950s, especially on dry sandy soils, than it is now. Some relict populations, however, are very persistent and long-lived.|A cultivated plant of obscure origin, perhaps native to S.W. Asia but widely naturalised in both N. & S. hemispheres. A wide range of forms has been developed for different climates.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Melampyrum arvense|An annual hemiparasite, mainly on the roots of grasses. Formerly an arable weed, it now occurs in open grassland beside hedges and ditch-banks, field-borders, in a disused brick-pit and on slumping chalk cliff-faces. Lowland.|Neophyte|Although an archaeophyte in parts of N. Europe, this conspicuous species was not recorded in Britain until 1724. Originally introduced with crop-seed, it has declined due to improved seed cleaning, agricultural intensification and a lack of disturbance at some sites. It was rare by 1930, and has continued to decline since then. It has been deliberately planted at some sites.|M. arvense has a European Temperate distribution, although it is absent from much of W. Europe.     © K. Marston, IWNHAS
Melampyrum cristatum|An annual hemiparasite of various woody and herbaceous species; mostly found on the margins of ancient Quercus robur woodlands, their clearings and rides and in associated field hedge banks on chalky boulder-clay soils. It is very rarely found in open grassland. Lowland.|Native|Much of the loss of M. cristatum had taken place before 1930, but the range has further contracted since then, with losses occurring through the cessation of traditional woodland management, and herbicide spraying of verges and field-borders. It has apparently been lost from its sole grassland site, in S. Essex, through trampling by horses.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Melampyrum pratense|An annual hemiparasite of woods, scrub, heaths and upland moorlands on well-drained, nutrient-poor acidic soils; more rarely in scrub, hedgerows and deciduous woodland on chalk and limestone. The large seeds are distributed by ants. Lowland to 960 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|M. pratense was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Many of the losses apparent on the map occurred before 1930, but the decline has accelerated since then. This is probably due to habitat loss and the cessation of traditional woodland management.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Melampyrum sylvaticum|An annual hemiparasite found in humid, lightly shaded situations on damp, usually somewhat enriched, acidic soils; in wooded ravines, in grassy hollows and on banks in woodlands and on upland cliff ledges. Near sea level to 760 m on Aonach air Chrith (W. Ross).|Native|This species has declined most in the southern and lowland parts of its range, and especially in N. Ireland where many losses occurred before 1930. Afforestation, nutrient enrichment, grazing and trampling by livestock have contributed to its decline. However, it is almost certainly under-recorded. It has been confused with some forms of M. pratense.|European Boreal-montane element.
Melica nutans|A rhizomatous, perennial grass of basic soil over limestone and other base-rich rocks, occurring in shady places in deciduous woodland, on woodland margins, in the grikes of limestone pavement and on rock ledges. Lowland to 820 m in Glen Isla (Angus).|Native|The 1962 Atlas showed some decline in M. nutans before 1930, especially in S. Scotland, but other than local losses the distribution is unchanged. It is now much better recorded.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Melica uniflora|A rhizomatous perennial grass of woodland rides and margins, of shady hedge banks and rock ledges, mainly on free-draining, base-rich soils. It often grows in localised patches, suggesting that regeneration is mainly by rhizomatous spread. 0-395 m (Ysbyty Ifan, Denbs.), and up to 485 m in the Scottish Highlands.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of M. uniflora since the 1962 Atlas, although the increase in records from N. Ireland is a remarkable example of improved recording. It has been lost from the Isle of Man, where it may have been originally introduced.|European Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Melilotus albus|An annual or biennial herb principally occurring as a casual on waste or disturbed ground, in railway sidings and by roadsides. Generally lowland, but reaching 335 m near Brassington (Derbys.).|Neophyte|M. albus, first recorded in the wild in Britain in 1822, is occasionally grown as green fodder, but it also arrives as a contaminant of lucerne, and as a wool and bird-seed alien. The distribution is probably stable but it is difficult to generalise about trends as some populations are short-lived; it may be increasing in some areas.|A native of Eurasia (perhaps S. Europe, W. & C. Asia) which has now spread to temperate and warm-temperate regions almost worldwide.
Melilotus altissimus|A biennial or short-lived perennial herb occurring in disturbed grassland and on roadsides, field-borders and waste places. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|M. altissimus has been known in Britain since the 16th century, and seems much more rural in its distribution than the other species of Melilotus. Its distribution is probably stable, but nomenclatural confusion in the past with M. officinalis may have obscured earlier trends.|A European Temperate species, with a native range now completely obscured by introductions.     © Shannon, P
Melilotus indicus|An annual usually occurring as a casual on waste ground and rubbish tips, and sometimes on cultivated ground. It is principally an alien of wool shoddy and bird-seed. Lowland.|Neophyte|M. indicus originally arrived in this country with S. American clover seed and was the latest of the four Melilotus species mapped to be recorded in the wild, in 1852. (It had apparently been cultivated in Britain in 1680 but did not spread from this source.) There has been a considerable decline in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas. Unlike the other Melilotus species, it does not seem to have spread far from rubbish tips.|Native of S. Europe, N. Africa, S.W. & C. Asia; widely naturalised further north in Europe and elsewhere.
Melilotus officinalis|A biennial herb, widely naturalised on roadsides, field-borders and grassy banks, but also occurring as a casual on rubbish tips and waste ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|M. officinalis came here as seeds introduced with clover from America, first being recorded in 1835. It is now better recorded than it was in the 1962 Atlas, but its overall distribution is stable.|Probably native from C. & S. Europe eastwards to C. Asia, but this distribution is obscured by alien occurrences; a widespread alien in N. America.
Melissa officinalis|A lemon-scented perennial herb, found on banks and road verges close to habitation, and on rubbish dumps and waste ground. This species is much grown in gardens where it seeds prolifically, often becoming a weed and escaping into nearby habitats. Lowland.|Neophyte|M. officinalis was being cultivated in British gardens by 995 (Harvey, 1981) and was recorded in the wild by 1763. It is a culinary herb which seems to be increasing as a garden escape.|Native of S. Europe, the Mediterranean region and S.W. Asia, but its native range is obscured by naturalised populations further north.
Melittis melissophyllum|A strong-smelling perennial herb of woodland, wood-borders, hedge banks and scrub on base-rich soils. In the New Forest (S. Hants.), it is a plant of ancient woodland. It favours light shade and can be abundant in cleared or coppiced woodland. It is intolerant of grazing. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of M. melissophyllum in Devon and Cornwall is apparently stable. However, it has declined markedly in the New Forest and Dorset over the past twenty years as a result of overshading and pony grazing, although at some sites it has reappeared after scrub clearance and coppicing.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Mentha aquatica|A rhizomatous perennial herb, typically associated with permanently wet habitats adjacent to open water, often partially or wholly submerged. It grows by ditches, ponds and rivers, in marshes, wet pastures, dune-slacks and fens, and in wet woods. It spreads clonally by extensive rhizomes, and by detached rhizome fragments, which are often dispersed by water. 0?455 m (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|The current map for M. aquatica is similar to that in the 1962 Atlas. There is no evidence for a change in its overall distribution.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Mentha arvensis|A rhizomatous perennial, rarely annual, herb of arable fields, woodland rides, marshy pastures and waste places; overlapping in habitat with M. aquatica but typically replacing it in drier habitats or where water levels fluctuate markedly. 0?390 m (Drumore Loch, E. Perth).|Native|M. arvensis was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that a substantial decline has occurred since 1950. It has declined as a weed of cultivated land, and this may partly account for the significant loss from the English Midlands northwards. Some early records may refer to M. x verticillata.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Mentha pulegium|A short-lived perennial herb of seasonally inundated grassland overlying silt and clay. The majority of native populations are now confined to pools, runnels, ruts and poached areas on heavily grazed village greens, but habitats also include damp heathy pastures, lake shores and coastal grassland. Lowland.|Native|M. pulegium was lost from many sites before 1930, but has declined further since then due to habitat destruction and the loss of traditional grazing on village greens. A robust variety has been introduced with N. American seed mixtures to a number of sites (Briggs, 1997b), and the species certainly appears to be increasing as an alien.|European Southern-temperate element.
Mentha spicata|A rhizomatous perennial herb naturalised in a variety of damp or wet habitats, and on rough and waste ground, usually close to habitation. Generally lowland, but reaching 350 m at Alston (Cumberland).|Archaeophyte|M. spicata was probably under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas because of confusion with M. longifolia, M. suaveolens and their hybrids. It is very commonly cultivated and spreads vigorously, so it is often discarded with garden rubbish. In some counties it is now the most common naturalised garden mint.|Origin unknown; derived from M. longifolia and M. suaveolens by hybridisation and chromosome doubling. It probably arose in cultivation.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Mentha suaveolens|A rhizomatous perennial herb of damp places. It is probably native only in S.W. England and Wales, and elsewhere occurs as a garden escape, often forming extensive colonies on roadsides and waste ground. Lowland.|Native|The apparent decline of M. suaveolens shown in the 1962 Atlas may have continued. However, its former abundance may be in part due to over-recording, as many early records of M. suaveolens (M. rotundifolia) are probably errors for M. x villosa (cf. Brewis et al., 1996; Halliday, 1997). It is possibly native as mapped, but its native range is obscured by garden escapes.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Menyanthes trifoliata|M. trifoliata is a rhizomatous perennial which grows as an emergent at the shallow edge of lakes, pools or slow-flowing rivers, or in swamps, flushes or dune-slacks. It tolerates a wide range of water chemistry, but is intolerant of shade. 0-1005 m (Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth).|Native|Although this species remains frequent over much of our area, it has decreased in S.E. England because of the drainage of wetlands in both historic and recent times. In some of these areas it is now more frequent as a planted ornamental than as a native.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Mercurialis annua|A dioecious annual of disturbed waste places, cultivated ground, particularly in allotments and gardens, rubbish tips, walls, and roadsides, thriving on light, nutrient-rich soils. It produces a long-lived seed bank. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|M. annua is known from archaeological deposits in Viking York. It has spread from ports and town gardens, and comparison of the current map with that in the 1962 Atlas suggests that is still increasing.|As an archaeophyte M. annua has a Submediterranean-Subatlantic distribution.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Mercurialis perennis|A rhizomatous, dioecious perennial herb usually growing on damp but free-draining base-rich soils. In the lowlands it is largely restricted to shaded sites, including ancient woodland, older secondary woodland, hedgerows and shaded banks, but in the uplands it occurs on unshaded basic crags, scree, cliff ledges and in ravines, particularly on moist N.-facing slopes, and it also grows in the grikes of limestone pavements. 0-1005 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of M. perennis since the 1962 Atlas. In Ireland, it is apparently native only in the Burren (Scannell & Synnott, 1987).|European Temperate element.
Mertensia maritima|A perennial herb, usually found on gravelly beaches and shingle but sometimes on sand. It can also colonise earth and rocks tipped at the coast (Randall, 1988). Seeds can survive prolonged immersion in sea water, and dispersion in sea currents enables colonisation of new, but sometimes transient, sites. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of M. maritima has varied markedly since 1800. In Britain expansion in the far north has been balanced by contraction in the south. In Ireland it declined during the last century, but is now increasing. Losses result from storms, recreational pressures, shingle removal and grazing.|European Boreo-arctic Montane element; a coastal species also found in E. Asia and N. America.
Mespilus germanica|A long-lived shrub or small tree occasionally found in hedges or woods, and as a relic of cultivation. In Britain, regeneration from seed appears to be very rare, but vegetative spread by suckering has been recorded. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|M. germanica has been grown in Britain since 995 (Harvey, 1981) and was later much planted in gardens and orchards for its fruits. It has apparently been less often planted in recent years, but trends in its distribution are difficult to discern.|Native of S.W. Asia and perhaps S.E. Europe; widely naturalised in C. Europe.
Meum athamanticum|A perennial herb of deep brown-earth neutral or mildly acidic soils occurring in dry, unimproved grassland in pastures, hay meadows and on roadside-banks. Mostly found below 300 m, though there are populations at 610 m at White Coombe (Dumfriess.) and Fealar (E. Perth).|Native|Many of the pre-1970 sites for M. athamanticum were lost before 1930 as a result of agricultural improvement of grassland and probably also through deliberate destruction because it can taint cows` milk. There have been further losses since the 1962 Atlas, though new sites have also been discovered, notably in N. Wales and Cumbria.|European Boreal-montane element, but absent from the Boreal zonobiome.
Mibora minima|A diminutive winter-annual of coastal sand dunes in Wales, on open nutrient-poor substrates which are free-draining but damp in winter; also, in the Channel Islands, on barish gravelly cliff-slopes. It is recorded at other dune sites in England and Scotland, and inland as a casual plant in nurseries and gardens. Lowland.|Native|Several new populations of M. minima have been discovered on dunes since 1980, and it is almost impossible to say whether they are native or alien. A Lancashire population, found in 1996, seems most likely to be the result of spread from the known native sites in Wales.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Milium effusum|A perennial herb of damp, deciduous woods and shaded banks, where it grows on winter-wet, calcareous to mildly acidic clay and loam soils, and also over rocks in W. Scotland. It is regarded as an indicator of ancient woodland in some parts of E. England. However, it is able to colonise open sites which are disturbed by felling or fire, and there is evidence of spread to more recent woodland in some upland areas. 0-380 m (W. of Dockray, Cumberland).|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It is now better recorded, and there is no evidence of a genuine change in its overall distribution.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Milium vernale|An inconspicuous, early-flowering, annual grass growing in small patches in the short, nearly closed turf of fixed dunes. Lowland.|Native|In our area, this species is known only from two localities on the north coast of Guernsey, where it was first recorded in 1899 but then remained unrecorded for fifty years. The Guernsey plant is a genetically distinct prostrate population which was described as subsp. sarniense by McClintock (1986).|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; it reaches its northern limit on the island of Terschelling, Netherlands.
Mimulus|A genus of vigorous, stoloniferous perennials which have become widely naturalised in damp places. 0?440 m (above Garrigill, Cumberland).|Neophyte|Mimulus taxa were cultivated as waterside garden plants by 1759. They have been known to be established in the wild since at least 1830 and some have hybridised both in cultivation and in the wild to form a critical complex of closely related taxa. Because of identification difficulties, the individual taxa are probably under-recorded. Many species and cultivars of Mimulus are now commercially available and further garden escapes can be expected.|An aggregate comprising alien species from western N. & S. America, and their hybrids.
Mimulus guttatus|This vigorous perennial herb is found in wet places by streams, rivers and ponds, in damp meadows, marshy ground and open woodland. It spreads both by seed and vegetatively, rooting from the nodes in wet mud or gravel. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Neophyte|M. guttatus is thought to have been introduced to cultivation in 1812. It soon became established in semi-natural habitats, being known in the wild by 1824. It continues to be a popular garden plant, but its distribution is probably stable. It has been much over-recorded for other taxa in the uplands.|Native of western N. America.
Mimulus guttatus x luteus (M. x robertsii)|A perennial hybrid of damp and wet places, including on mud and shingle by streams and rivers, in flushes and in marshy ground. This hybrid is partially fertile, and can spread vegetatively from stem fragments. It ascends to over 440 m above Garrigill (Cumberland) and probably to 610 m in the Ochils (W. Perth).|Neophyte|M. x robertsii was first recognised in Britain by Roberts (1964) but not named as M. x robertsii until 1990. The earliest record traced dates to 1872 (Berwicks.). It is the commonest taxon of high ground, and many records of Mimulus agg., M. luteus, and even M. guttatus are probably referable to this hybrid, which is therefore likely to be under-recorded.|A hybrid of garden origin.
Mimulus luteus|A creeping mat-forming perennial herb naturalised in damp or wet places such as marshes and flushes, and on riversides and river shingle. It reproduces by seed and vegetatively from stem fragments. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Neophyte|M. luteus was introduced into cultivation c. 1826. It is very local and has been much over-recorded for M. x robertsii (M. guttatus x M. luteus). The map may contain some errors, particularly amongst the pre-1987 records.|Native of S. America (Andes).
Mimulus moschatus|A decumbent perennial herb, casual or naturalised in damp, often shaded places, including the muddy edges of ditches, wooded swamps, damp woodland rides, by ponds and in damp pasture. Seed has considerable longevity in the soil. Lowland.|Neophyte|M. moschatus was introduced to gardens in 1826, spreading from there into semi-natural habitats; it was recorded from the wild by 1866. It is a very distinct species which has not hybridised with the other Mimulus taxa, and ought to be well recorded. Its distribution is stable.|Native of western N. America.
Minuartia hybrida|This annual grows on light soils in dry places. Its natural habitat is dry, rocky, calcareous grassland on chalk and limestone. However, it is more frequent in artificial habitats such as abandoned arable fields, quarries, old walls, trackways, railway banks and sidings. Mainly lowland, but reaching 400 m at Langcliffe in the Craven Pennines (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|M. hybrida has greatly declined in arable and grassland habitats through agricultural intensification, but this has been somewhat offset by records from railways. This loss had mainly occurred before the 1962 Atlas, but has continued since.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.
Minuartia recurva|This tufted, calcifugous perennial herb grows in thin humus in dry narrow cracks in slabs of siliceous rocks of Old Red Sandstone age. 510-610 m in the Caha Mountains (S. Kerry and W. Cork).|Native|M. recurva was discovered in 1964 in the Caha Mountains, where two populations are found straddling the Cork-Kerry border. These populations appear to be stable.|European Arctic-montane element; confined to the mountains of S.W. Asia, S. & S.C. Europe and Ireland.
Minuartia rubella|This cushion-forming montane perennial herb is always associated with strongly base-rich rocks, including limestone and soft calcareous schists. The vegetation is usually open, as the ground on which it usually grows is both easily eroded and subjected to frost-heave. It reaches an altitude of 1180 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth), and formerly descended to 120 m on Unst (Shetland).|Native|The national population of M. rubella is likely to be stable, but its discovery in 1990 in the Ben Alder range (Westerness) extended its known range.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.
Minuartia sedoides|M. sedoides is a mat- or cushion-forming perennial herb of base-rich rocks, flushed grassland, exposed montane heath, and mountain ledges and plateaux. From 335 m on Skye (N. Ebudes) to 1200 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth), but has been recorded at 215 m washed down in the stony bed of the R. Fillan at Tyndrum (Mid Perth).|Native|There has probably been little or no change in its 10-km distribution since the 1962 Atlas, since it is likely to be extant in most of the squares for which only pre-1970 records are available.|European Arctic-montane element; confined to the mountains of C. Europe and Scotland.
Minuartia stricta|A loosely tufted but slender perennial herb that has only ever been known in Britain from Widdybank Fell, where it grows in open, gravelly flushes and eroding margins of sikes on metamorphic sugar limestone. The plant is not a strong competitor and is mainly associated with hummock-forming mosses and species such as Carex capillaris, Juncus triglumis, Minuartia verna and Primula farinosa. Upland, from 490 to 510 m on Widdybank Fell (Co. Durham).|Native|There is no change in distribution from the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Minuartia verna|M. verna is a perennial, basicolous, cushion-forming herb, characteristic of Carboniferous limestone districts where it is found in short grassland, on scars, on limestone pavement and scree. It also grows on base-rich volcanic rock in N. Wales and basalt in N. Ireland, on metal-rich soils, including those derived from serpentine, and on mining spoil. It prefers open sites with reduced competition, but may suffer from drought in very exposed conditions. Although seldom above 600 m, it has been recorded at 875 m on Snowdon (Caerns.).|Native|The distribution of M. verna is broadly stable.|Eurasian Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Misopates orontium|A spring-germinating annual of light soils, found in arable and other cultivated ground including among horticultural crops, and in gardens and waste places. It reproduces by seed, but cold, wet summers inhibit its germination and growth. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|M. orontium has declined because of agricultural intensification and the more widespread autumn sowing of crops. Salisbury (1961) noted that it appeared to be less frequent than formerly, and since then it has declined sharply, disappearing from almost half of its 10-km squares in S.E. England in the last forty years.|As an archaeophyte M. orontium has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Moehringia trinervia|An annual of open, often moist, ground, generally found in woodland but also in shaded hedge banks, and rarely in unshaded places such as on walls and railway banks. It favours slightly acidic substrates, and there is a slight preference for warmer slopes in woodland, which hastens the successful completion of the plant`s life-cycle. 0-425 m (Mallowdale Fell, W. Lancs.).|Native|There appears no significant change since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`.|European Temperate element; also in E. Asia.     © Shannon, P
Moenchia erecta|This annual grows on summer-droughted soils in tightly-grazed grasslands and heaths, on cliff-tops, pathsides, coastal dunes and sandy shingle, usually in open patches where competition is limited. It is also found in quarries and sand-pits, and on other disturbed ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 410 m at Widecombe, Dartmoor (S. Devon).|Native|The species suffered a considerable decline before 1930, and this decline may still be continuing. The increased number of 10-km records since the 1962 Atlas must be attributed to a greater intensity of recording of this rather inconspicuous species.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Molinia caerulea|This deciduous perennial herb is found in a wide range of habitats, especially open heaths, moors, bogs and fens, but also in open birchwoods, mountain grassland and cliffs and stony lake margins. It is found on mildly basic to strongly acidic peats and mineral soils which are permanently or seasonally wet. 0-870 m (Meikle Kilrannoch, Angus).|Native|M. caerulea, mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, has declined in some lowland areas through habitat destruction. Conversely, it has increased in frequency where grazing has ceased. Subsp. caerulea is found throughout the range of the species, subsp. arundinacea is widespread but scattered in fens and by rivers and canals.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Moneses uniflora|A mycorrhizal, evergreen perennial herb, spreading by rhizomes within leaf litter and bryophytes in ericaceous dwarf shrub communities of old pine plantations, rarely now in native Pinus sylvestris forests. The solitary flower is insect-pollinated, but recruitment from seed is rare and most propagation is vegetative. Lowland, reaching 300 m (Castle Grant, Moray).|Native|Diminished by past collection, this attractive species has continued to decline through changes in land use and forest management. Much of this decline took place before 1970, but its future is dependent on sympathetic management. Most remaining populations are small and vulnerable.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Monotropa hypopitys|A saprophytic perennial herb of leaf litter in shaded woodlands, most frequent under Fagus and Corylus on calcareous substrates, and under Pinus on more acidic soils. It also grows in damp dune-slacks, where it is usually associated with Salix repens. 0-395 m (Buxton, Derbys.).|Native|A polyploid complex, with two subspecies in our area which are not easily separable morphologically. Although many sites were lost before 1930, the species has suffered a further marked decline in S. England since the 1962 Atlas. Though rare in Ireland, Curtis & McGough (1988) considered it to have been under-recorded in recent years.|Circumpolar Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Montia fontana|An annual to perennial herb of acidic or neutral, seasonally or permanently wet places, including springs and flushes, where it often grows in bryophyte-rich communities, the sides of lakes, rivers and streams, damp tracks and paths and winter-moist sand or gravel. 0-945 m (Mt Brandon, S. Kerry), with unlocalised records from 970 m in the Scottish Highlands.|Native|The species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There has probably been some loss in lowland England since then. The four subspecies in our area were mapped by Perring & Sell (1968) and are mapped separately here.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in C. & E. Asia and N. America.     © Shannon, P
Muscari neglectum|A bulbous perennial herb on free-draining soils, native or long-naturalised in grasslands, hedgerows, pine plantations and rough ground, and on roadsides on a wide range of nutrient-poor soils. It is also a short-lived garden escape or outcast near habitation, on roadsides, allotments and waste ground. Lowland.|Native|M. neglectum was first recorded in Britain in 1776. It is sometimes considered native in E. England, where its range has contracted in recent years, mainly as a result of development. As an alien this species has been confused with, and over-recorded for, M. armeniacum, which is more common in gardens and as an escape.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Mycelis muralis|A winter-green perennial herb of shaded walls, rock outcrops and hedge banks, and in woodland, wood margins and scrub, especially on chalk and limestone but also on acidic rocks in some areas. In the Burren (Co. Clare) it occurs on open limestone pavement. 0-500 m (Alston Moor, Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of M. muralis has remained largely unchanged since the 1962 Atlas, though there are now more records from Scotland and Ireland. It is almost certainly an introduction in Ireland, where it is now frequent in semi-natural habitats in the Burren, where it was not recorded until 1939, and southern Co. Down.|European Temperate element.
Myosotis alpestris|A perennial herb found in two contrasting habitats: heavily-grazed limestone grassland on base-rich well-drained soils in the Pennines, and both on and below mica-schist ledges on ungrazed cliffs in Perthshire, often in open communities. Reproduction is by seed. From 685 m in Teesdale (N.W. Yorks. and Westmorland) to 1180 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of M. alpestris is generally stable, though some populations in the Pennines appear to be in decline. The English and Scottish populations are ecotypically distinct (Elkington, 1964).|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Myosotis arvensis|An annual or biennial herb of open or disturbed ground, especially cultivated fields. Other habitats include woodland edges, open grassland, hedges, scrub, roadsides, walls and quarries. 0-610 m (Nenthead, Cumberland), and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Archaeophyte|Despite changes in agricultural practice, the distribution of M. arvensis has remained stable since 1900, due in part to its flexible life history and seed longevity. The larger-flowered var. sylvestris is often mistaken for M. sylvatica, but such errors are unlikely to have affected the map.|As an archaeophyte M. arvensis has a Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © Shannon, P
Myosotis discolor|An annual of open grassland and disturbed ground occurring in a wide range of habitats, including fen- and hay-meadows, pastures, moorland edges, marshes, dune-slacks, arable field margins, road verges, railway tracks, chalk- and gravel-pits, rocks and walls. Generally lowland, but reaching 610 m on Little Fell (Westmorland) and 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|M. discolor was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that the widespread decline in S. and E. England has taken place since 1950. It is, however, much more comprehensively recorded in the south and west.|European Temperate element.
Myosotis laxa|An annual or biennial herb of wet ground, often growing in open places trampled by livestock or where there has been other disturbance. It occurs in marshes, fen-meadows, rush-pastures, and by lakes, ponds, canals, rivers and streams. Lowland to 530 m in Atholl (E. Perth) and 550 m in Co. Londonderry.|Native|M. laxa was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, and apart from local losses in S.E. England, seems little changed in distribution.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.     © P. Shannon
Myosotis ramosissima|An annual of open habitats or bare ground on dry, relatively infertile soils. It is found in chalk and limestone grassland, on sandy heaths and banks, stabilised dunes, the borders of sandy cultivated fields, railway tracks, rocks, walls, gravel-pits, quarry spoil and waste ground. 0-430 m (above Swindale, Brough, Westmorland).|Native|M. ramosissima was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There have been some local losses since 1950, possibly caused by the loss of close-grazed semi-natural communities in inland areas.|European Southern-temperate element.     © Shannon, P
Myosotis scorpioides|A stoloniferous or rhizomatous perennial herb found in damp or wet habitats, usually in fertile, calcareous to mildly acidic soils. It is usually terrestrial, occurring by lakes, ponds, rivers and streams, in marshes and in fens, but may sometimes be aquatic, forming submerged patches or floating rafts. 0-600 m (Moor House, Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of M. scorpioides has been generally stable over many decades. It has sometimes been confused with M. secunda, and some errors may be included on the map.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Myosotis secunda|A stoloniferous annual to perennial herb found by streams and pools, in marshy pasture, moorland flushes and springs. It prefers acid peaty soils, and usually avoids calcareous soils. 0-805 m (Carnedd Llewelyn, Caerns.).|Native|This species has sometimes been confused with M. scorpioides and M. laxa, and the map in the 1962 Atlas certainly contained some errors. It is now more comprehensively recorded, and there appears to have been little change in its distribution, other than declines at the edge of its range in C. & S. England. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Myosotis sicula|"An annual only ever known from two sites on Jersey, in damp places on Ouaisné Common and by a small pool near the coast at Noirmont. Lowland.
 



      Trends    

Native. M. sicula was discovered at both its Jersey localities by A. J. Wilmott in 1922. It was last seen at Ouaisné Common in 1957. The Noirmont population disappeared in the 1980s when the pool became shaded by Salix species, but these were cleared in 1983 and it was rediscovered at the site in 1992. The very small population there maintains a precarious existence.

Myosotis stolonifera|A perennial herb growing by rills and along base-rich spring-lines and flushes. Mainly upland, reaching 820 m on Cross Fell (Cumberland), and down to 130 m in the Lune valley (Cumberland).|Native|This species was first collected in Britain in 1919, from the N. Pennines, and initially described as an endemic, M. brevifolia (Salmon, 1926). It was inadequately recorded for the 1962 Atlas, the plant not being sought in areas distant from the original sites. However, following a study of its characteristic features, M. stolonifera became better known and it has been found more widely, notably in S. Scotland. It may still be overlooked elsewhere.|Oceanic Boreal-montane element; confined to Portugal, Spain and Britain.
Myosotis sylvatica|An erect biennial or perennial herb growing as a native, at least in England, on damp, fertile soils in woodland and rocky grassland. It is much more widespread in a wider range of habitats as a garden escape. 0-485 m (East Stone Gill, N.W. Yorks.).|Native|The native range of M. sylvatica has been totally obscured by escapes, and all records are mapped as if they are native. Alien plants were once similar to the natives but are now often recognisable by their more varied, brighter flower colours. Such escapes were excluded from the map in the 1962 Atlas. Large-flowered variants of M. arvensis may have been reported as this species.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Myosoton aquaticum|This perennial herb usually grows in damp or wet habitats, including damp woods, Alnus and Salix carr, the banks of rivers, streams, canals and ditches, by ponds and in marshes and other wet places. It has been recorded on newly surfaced forestry rides, and can also tolerate occasional flooding by brackish water. Lowland.|Native|The distribution has been stable since the 1962 Atlas. Some records in the north of its range represent casual occurrences.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; also in E. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Myosurus minimus|An annual of seasonally flooded, nutrient-rich soils in areas disturbed by machinery or animals, such as hollows on ploughed land, rutted tracks and gateways in pastures. Its seeds appear to be long-lived. Lowland.|Native|It is difficult to assess trends in this inconspicuous and sporadic species, which was known in Britain by 1597. Many sites were lost before 1930, probably through the disuse of commons, re-surfacing of tracks and the drainage and filling of small ponds. It persists in areas such as coastal grazing marshes.|European Temperate element; also in N. America and Australasia and widely naturalised elsewhere.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Myrica gale|A small shrub which suckers to form dense thickets. It grows in organic soils in base-poor bogs and moorland, lowland raised bogs, wet heaths and acid carr; in all its sites, moving groundwater is a constant feature. It tolerates light shade and is not grazed. Generally lowland, but reaching at least 520 m in the Forest of Drumochter (Easterness).|Native|Some lowland populations have been lost to peat extraction and agricultural reclamation, whilst others have gone as woodland develops on bogs that have been drained or are drying out due to a falling water-table. In the uplands the distribution is stable.|Suboceanic Boreo-temperate element; also in E. Asia and N. America.
Myriophyllum alterniflorum|This submerged aquatic perennial occurs in both standing and flowing waters, including rapidly flowing, peaty streams and rivers in which few other macrophytes grow. In Scotland and Ireland it occurs in a wide range of habitats (including, occasionally, highly calcareous sites) but in S.E. England it is confined to acidic, mesotrophic or oligotrophic waters. 0-780 m (Lochan an Tairbh-uisge, Mid Perth).|Native|The map of this species is much more complete than that in the 1962 Atlas, with many more 10-km square records in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The losses in lowland England largely occurred before 1930.|Suboceanic Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.
Myriophyllum aquaticum|This perennial often grows in emergent masses in small, sheltered, eutrophic water bodies, especially ponds and ditches but also reservoirs, canals and flooded mineral workings. Only female plants are known in Britain and they spread clonally by vegetative fragmentation. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species, which has been grown in water gardens in Britain since 1878, was first recorded in the wild in 1960 in Surrey and in 1969 in E. Sussex; in Ireland it was first seen in Co. Down in 1990. It is introduced when surplus garden plants are dumped in the wild and the extent to which it spreads naturally to new sites is unknown.|Native of central S. America; female plants are now widely naturalised in warm temperate and tropical areas elsewhere.
Myriophyllum spicatum|This species grows in a wide range of meso-eutrophic or eutrophic and often calcareous waters. These include lakes, ponds, rivers, canals and ditches. It may persist in managed ditches and rivers and colonises newly flooded mineral workings. It also grows in slightly brackish sites. 0-390 m (Drumore Loch, E. Perth).|Native|This is the commonest Myriophyllum species in the eutrophic lowlands of Britain and in some areas of Ireland. Like many aquatic plants it is better recorded now than in the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.
Myriophyllum verticillatum|M. verticillatum is a robust, perennial plant of clear or slightly turbid, still or slowly flowing calcareous water in lakes, streams, canals and ditches. It occurs over both peaty and inorganic substrates. It flowers and sets seed, and also perennates by specialised turions which are produced in the leaf axils. Lowland.|Native|This species is probably more frequent in the calcareous central plain of Ireland than elsewhere in our area, and there it is probably still under-recorded. The decline in M. verticillatum in S. England began before the 1962 Atlas, and has continued since then.|Circumpolar Temperate element.
Myrrhis odorata|A perennial herb of hedge banks, woodland margins, roadside verges, river banks and other grassy places. Many sites are near houses or old settlements, indicating its origin in cultivation, but it is also often found in places remote from habitation. Generally lowland, but reaching 500 m in E. Allendale (S. Northumb.).|Neophyte|This species was first recorded from the wild in 1777. There has been little appreciable change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of the mountains of C. & S. Europe; widely naturalised elsewhere in temperate Europe.     © P. Shannon
Najas flexilis|This aquatic plant is an annual which is usually found in deep, clear, mesotrophic lakes where the water receives some base-enrichment from nearby basalt, limestone or calcareous dune-sand. Lowland.|Native|This is an elusive species which has been recorded at an increasing number of British and Irish sites in recent years as a result of lake surveys. It has, however, apparently been lost from its only English site, Esthwaite Water (Westmorland), and some lakes in E. Scotland because of eutrophication.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © O.L. Pescott
Najas marina|N. marina grows in meso-eutrophic water over deep substrates of peat or silty mud in the Norfolk broads. It is a dioecious annual, with both male and female plants in Britain. Lowland.|Native|First discovered in Britain in 1883 (Hickling Broad, E. Norfolk), N. marina decreased in the late 1960s as a result of pollution, but has since responded to action which has been taken to reduce nutrient levels in the Norfolk Broads.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W.

Narcissus pseudonarcissus||||
Nardus stricta|A densely tufted, shortly rhizomatous perennial found on winter-wet, base-poor, infertile and peaty soils, occurring in great quantity on upland hill-slopes, moorland and mountains, including snow-bed communities, but also found on lowland mires, heaths and acidic grasslands, and even sometimes in the upper reaches of saltmarsh turf. 0-1250 m (Ben Macdui, S. Aberdeen).|Native|Although the range of N. stricta has not changed appreciably since the 1962 Atlas, it continues to decline locally in lowland Britain because of habitat destruction.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in C. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Narthecium ossifragum|A rhizomatous perennial herb of wet, moderately basic to strongly acidic mineral soils and peats, in a wide range of raised, valley and blanket mire communities, and in wet heaths and flushes, especially where there is some water movement. It is intolerant of shade. Although it is slightly toxic, plants in the uplands may be heavily grazed. 0-1005 m (Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth) but reportedly to 1130 m elsewhere in Scotland.|Native|Many sites for N. ossifragum were lost from lowland England before the 1962 Atlas. There have since been further local losses, notably from Surrey and Sussex, but the distribution is stable elsewhere.|Oceanic Boreo-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Neotinea maculata|This tuberous perennial herb grows in a wide range of habitats on base-rich rocky or gravelly substrates. It can be found in the crevices of limestone pavement, in old pastures, hill grasslands, dunes and on road verges. Occasionally, it occurs on peat overlying more acidic rocks, and in Corylus-Fraxinus woodland. Lowland.|Native|Although this species has been lost from many sites in Ireland, it has recently been found at several new sites and its overall distribution is stable. It was found in the Isle of Man in 1967, but has not been recorded from there since 1986.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Neottia nidus-avis|This saprophytic herb is most frequent in the deep humus of densely shaded Fagus woods on chalky soils. Less commonly it occurs in mixed deciduous woodland and mature Corylus coppices, on soils derived from limestones and base-rich clays and sands. Lowland.|Native|N. nidus-avis suffered a considerable decline throughout the 20th century, but particularly between 1930 and 1970, and especially in S.E. England. It is very vulnerable to habitat disruption, and most losses are probably due to changes in woodland management and coniferisation. It has not declined to the same extent in Ireland.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; also in E. Asia.     © L. Rooney
Nepeta cataria|A perennial herb of open grassland, waysides, hedge banks, roadsides and rough ground on calcareous soils. In addition to such long-established populations, plants occasionally escape from gardens and give rise to casual populations which rarely persist for more than a few seasons. The seed is long-lived. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|The marked contraction in range of N. cataria shown in the 1962 Atlas has continued. In Northamptonshire it has declined as a result of hedgerow removal (Gent et al., 1995). Elsewhere, the intensification of agriculture and the growth of scrub have claimed many sites.|As an archaeophyte N. cataria has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © P. Shannon
Nuphar lutea|This perennial grows in mildly acidic or basic, mesotrophic or eutrophic water in lakes and slowly flowing rivers, canals and large ditches. Its submerged leaves allow it to persist in disturbed sites where the floating leaves are broken off. Generally lowland, but reaching 510 m at Llyn Crugnant (Cards.).|Native|Although N. lutea has been planted in some sites, it is less frequently introduced than Nymphaea alba and we have therefore attempted to map its native distribution. There is little evidence of change since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; closely related taxa occur in N. America.
Nuphar pumila|N. pumila grows in oligotrophic or mesotrophic water in lakes, sheltered bays, ditches and pools in marshes and bogs. It persists in one eutrophic lake in Shropshire. Lowland; upland records require confirmation.|Native|This species has long been confused with the hybrid N. lutea x N. pumila (N. x spenneriana), and the distribution of both is still poorly known. However, it is much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreal element; absent from western N. America and the eastern population is sometimes distinguished as N. microphylla.
Nymphaea alba|N. alba grows in lakes, ponds, the backwaters of rivers or large ditches, and occasionally in mires. It tolerates a wide range of water chemistry but lacks submerged leaves and is therefore vulnerable to disturbance by boats. Generally lowland, but reaching 405 m at Dock Tarn (Cumberland) and formerly 480 m at Angle Tarn (Westmorland).|Native|The native range of N. alba in our area has been obscured by introductions, and all records are mapped as if they are native. The increased frequency in S.E. England since the 1962 Atlas perhaps reflects the recording of such alien populations, which also include hybrids and cultivars.|European Temperate element.
Nymphoides peltata|A rhizomatous perennial which grows in water 0.5-2 metres deep in lakes, ponds, slowly flowing rivers, canals and large fenland ditches. As a native it is a plant of calcareous and eutrophic water. Lowland.|Native|N. peltata had declined as a native in the Thames valley by 1960, but remains frequent in the fenlands of East Anglia. It is popularly grown as an ornamental, and has become widely naturalised from material deliberately planted in the wild or discarded as surplus stock. These records obscure some of the older native occurrences.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Odontites vernus|An annual root-hemiparasite of short, often trampled grasslands, tracks, waste places, the edges of arable fields, gravelly and rocky seashores and saltmarshes. 0-540 m (Nenthead, Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of this species has not altered significantly since the 1962 Atlas. Three subspecies are represented in our area: subsp. vernus is widespread, subsp. serotinus is concentrated in S. Britain and Ireland, and subsp. litoralis is mapped separately.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Oenanthe aquatica|A tuberous perennial herb of still or slow-moving water, usually occurring on deep, silty, often eutrophic, substrates in shallow ponds and ditches, often where water fluctuates in depth. It also grows in open vegetation by sheltered lakes, reservoirs, canals, streams and rivers, and in marshes and seasonally flooded depressions. Lowland.|Native|O. aquatica has declined throughout its British range but particularly in the east. It is, however, better recorded now in its core areas than it was in the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; also in E. Asia.     © P. Shannon
Oenanthe crocata|A tuberous perennial herb of shallow water in ditches, the banks of streams, rivers, canals, lakes and ponds, roadside culverts, marshes and wet woodland, among boulders at the top of beaches and on dripping or flushed sea-cliffs. Reproduction is usually by seed, and it perhaps spreads when detached tuberous roots are washed downstream. Generally lowland, but reaching 320 m in The Paps (N. Kerry).|Native|Though highly poisonous to man and animals, this species is rarely eradicated from sites, and its national distribution is largely stable.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Oenanthe fistulosa|A perennial herb of damp or wet habitats, usually in areas of winter flooding. It occurs in meadows and pastures in the flood plains of rivers, in marshes and fens, and in emergent and fringing vegetation by rivers, streams, canals, ditches, lakes and ponds. It reproduces by seed, and spreads by stolons. In heavily grazed swards seed is produced virtually at ground level from secondary growth. Lowland.|Native|This species, mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, has appreciably declined because of drainage and the re-seeding of old grassland or its conversion to arable. Most losses appear to have occurred since 1950.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Oenanthe fluviatilis|An aquatic perennial herb, most frequent in clear, meso-eutrophic water of calcareous streams and rivers; also found in canals and ditches, but rarely in ponds. In flowing water, propagation is usually by plants rooting at nodes, or by vegetative fragmentation. Flowering is more frequent in still or sluggish water, but the frequency of reproduction from seed is unknown. Lowland.|Native|The decline in this species was evident in the 1962 Atlas and has continued. The main reasons are eutrophication from agricultural run-off, dredging, and canalisation of rivers. However, it was clearly under-recorded in 1962 and may still be overlooked in some areas.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Oenanthe lachenalii|In coastal areas this perennial herb occurs in the uppermost parts of saltmarshes, in rough grassland in drained estuarine marshes, by brackish dykes and the lower reaches of tidal rivers. Inland, it is found in base-enriched habitats, including marshes, fen-meadows and tall-herb fen. Lowland.|Native|O. lachenalii is still widespread and locally plentiful, especially around the coast, but inland sites have been lost to drainage and land-fill. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Oenanthe pimpinelloides|A tuberous perennial herb, found in hay meadows and pastures, especially those which are horse-grazed, and on roadsides. It grows in both damp and dry grassland, being the only Oenanthe which grows in dry habitats in our area. Lowland.|Native|Despite many losses, this species is still present in very large numbers on some roadsides and in unimproved fields. Many of its outlying sites have been discovered since 1960, due to an expansion of its range or the existence of previously overlooked sites. It was recently discovered in Co. Clare, where it may have been introduced in a seed mixture.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Oenanthe silaifolia|This perennial herb is found in damp grassland which receives calcareous flood-water in winter. It normally grows in hay meadows and may occur abundantly in lammas meadows, but only as depauperate individuals in more intensively farmed land. It also occurs on damp streamsides. Lowland.|Native|Many sites were lost before 1930, but new sites for this species have been discovered since the 1962 Atlas, and its known range has been extended to E. Yorkshire. It is eliminated by even quite modest agricultural intensification. All records from Dorset, mapped in both the 1962 Atlas and in Stewart et al. (1994), are now regarded as errors for O. lachenalii.|European Southern-temperate element.
Oenothera|Annual or biennial herbs of open habitats on sandy or waste ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|Oenothera taxa were cultivated in Britain by 1629. The taxonomic interpretation of this genus has changed considerably over the last fifty years. Hybridisation and backcrossing are frequent, reciprocal crosses often having different characters, making identification very difficult. Some records mapped as species may therefore refer to hybrids.|An aggregate of closely related species originally from N. & S. America, and their hybrids and derivatives.
Oenothera biennis|A tall biennial of open ground on sandy soils, found on sand dunes, river banks, waste ground, railway sidings and roadsides, in neglected cultivated fields, quarries, sand-pits and rubbish tips. Large numbers often occur on freshly opened ground, but they quickly decrease as the vegetation closes. Lowland.|Neophyte|O. biennis was cultivated in Britain by 1629 and was recorded in the wild in about 1650. It often grows with other Oenothera species, and hybrids may outnumber pure O. biennis. Losses since the 1962 Atlas are possibly due to the transient nature of some colonies and past misidentifications.|O. biennis was introduced either from N. America, or from Europe from N. American progenitors.
Oenothera biennis x glazoviana (O. x fallax)||||
Oenothera cambrica|A tall biennial of open ground on light soils, found on sand dunes, sandy seashores and river banks, waste ground, tracksides, railway land and roadsides, dockland, and in old cultivated areas, quarries and sand-pits. Lowland.|Neophyte|O. cambrica was introduced to cultivation in Britain in 1775, and was first recorded from the wild in Cardiff (Glamorgan) in 1833. Hybrids with both O. biennis and O. glazioviana form readily and can outnumber or replace pure O. cambrica. It is now considerably more common than when mapped in the 1962 Atlas.|Probably native of N. America, or evolved in Europe from ancestors originally from N. America.
Oenothera glazioviana|A tall, conspicuous biennial of open ground on sandy soils, often near the sea but also inland on waste ground, railway sidings and roadsides, in old cultivated areas, quarries and sand-pits. Large numbers are often found on freshly opened ground, though populations quickly decrease as the vegetation closes. Lowland.|Neophyte|O. glazioviana was first cultivated in Britain in about 1858, and recorded from the wild in 1866. It has spread and consolidated its range since the 1962 Atlas, and is now by far the commonest species of the genus in Britain. It readily hybridises with O. biennis and O. cambrica.|Native of N. America.
Onobrychis viciifolia|A perennial herb which occurs in a dwarf form in unimproved chalk grassland. Robust alien variants are found on grassy banks, roadsides and by tracks on chalk and less often on other calcareous soils. They can be abundant on newly sown roadsides. Generally lowland, reaching 335 m near Taddington (Derbys.).|Native|The chalk grassland form of O. viciifolia may be native, but the limits of its native distribution have been obscured by aliens. Agricultural variants were introduced in the 17th century and widely cultivated for fodder until the 19th century. The species is increasing as a constituent of wild-flower mixtures and as a contaminant of grass-seed.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Ononis reclinata|An annual of thin, dry, calcareous soils with a low organic content, especially on S.- or S.W.-facing coastal cliffs of limestone and, in Scotland, greywacke. In the Channel Islands it occurs in consolidated dune turf. Populations often fluctuate in size, sometimes very markedly. Lowland.|Native|The overall distribution of O. reclinata has not changed significantly since the 1962 Atlas. New sites have, however, been discovered near to known colonies, but the species was lost in Guernsey in 1956 through the growth of rank vegetation.|Mediterranean?Atlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Ononis repens|A rhizomatous perennial sub-shrub, widespread in grasslands on base-rich, well-drained, light soils, and also on calcareous boulder-clays. On the coast it occurs on sand dunes and shingle, and inland it is frequently a colonist of sandy or gravelly road verges. 0-365 m (Weardale, Co. Durham).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the overall distribution of O. repens since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`, although it does appear to have declined in parts of C. England and N.E. Scotland. Small, densely hairy plants from maritime sands in Devon have been referred to subsp. maritima, but their taxonomic status needs clarification.|European Temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Ononis spinosa|A woody perennial of infertile calcareous grasslands on chalk, limestone and heavy calcareous clay soils. It also occurs on the coast in grazing marshes and on earthen sea-walls. Lowland.|Native|O. spinosa is probably declining, especially in S.E. England, because of agricultural improvements. It is over-recorded for spiny forms of O. repens (var. horrida); some old records of O. spinosa in the 1962 Atlas are now regarded as dubious.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Onopordum acanthium|A tall biennial herb of fields, hedgerows, rubbish tips and other waste places, often near market gardens and farm buildings, and perhaps dispersed to new sites with manure or contaminated straw. 0-330 m (near Alston, Cumberland).|Archaeophyte|There is archaeological evidence for the presence of O. acanthium in Britain from the Iron Age onwards. It appears to have increased in frequency since the 1962 Atlas, possibly as an escape from gardens where it is frequently grown for ornament.|As an archaeophyte O. acanthium has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Ophioglossum azoricum|A small rhizomatous, deciduous fern of gently sloping grassland, cliff-tops, damp dune-slacks and sandy maritime heaths on both acidic and alkaline soils. Most sites are frost-free situations near to and facing the sea, with exceptions in the New Forest (S. Hants.) where it grows in highly-grazed damp grassland. Lowland.|Native|In the past small plants of O. vulgatum have been mis-identified as O. azoricum, and this has led to an unjustified impression that the species is declining. Although the number of sites is low, populations or single clones can spread over many square metres.|Suboceanic Boreo-temperate element.
Ophioglossum lusitanicum|A small, rhizomatous, summer-deciduous fern, growing in open therophyte communities and parched acidic grassland on sea-cliffs and rock promontories. It prefers thin peaty soils, but is also found over shallow blown sand over acidic rocks. All sites are unshaded and exposed, but are warm and S.- or S.W.-facing. Lowland.|Native|O. lusitanicum was first discovered in Guernsey in 1853, but not found on the Isles of Scilly until 1950. In Guernsey, many sites have been lost to encroachment by Ulex europaeus owing to under-grazing.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; also in C. Asia.
Ophioglossum vulgatum|A rhizomatous, deciduous fern found on mildly acidic to base-rich soils in open woodland, meadows and damp pastures, and on sand dunes, under Pteridium on heaths, and on peat in regularly mown fen. 0-660 m (Burnhope Seat, Cumberland).|Native|O. vulgatum is an inconspicuous species which is very much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas. It has been lost from many lowland sites where the intensification of agriculture, grazing and drainage have contributed to its decline.|Circumpolar Temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Ophioglossum vulgatum sens.lat.||||
Ophrys apifera|A tuberous perennial herb of calcareous, well-drained soils. Habitats include grasslands, scrub, railway banks, roadsides, lawns, sand dunes and limestone pavement; also disturbed sites such as quarries, gravel-pits and industrial waste ground. 0-335 m (near Parsley Hay, Derbys.).|Native|The overall distribution of this species in Britain is stable, but it has declined in Ireland, where many losses were before 1930. Declines are due to habitat destruction, especially ploughing of grassland and the in-filling of quarries. It is, however, much better recorded now, and readily colonises newly available sites.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Ophrys fuciflora|This long-lived, tuberous perennial herb grows on well-drained calcareous, chalky soil in species-rich, closely grazed grassland; it cannot compete in longer grassland. Some colonies are on previously disturbed areas, but rarely spread to adjacent sites. Lowland.|Native|Historically, sites for O. fuciflora have been lost due to grassland improvement, ploughing and the cessation of grazing. It was lost from two 10-km squares before 1950. Remaining populations, of which only five now produce plants regularly, are all protected and carefully managed.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Ophrys insectifera|A shade-tolerant tuberous herb usually found on chalk and limestone soils in open deciduous woodland and scrub, but also recorded from grassland, chalk-pits, limestone pavement, disused railways, spoil heaps and, rarely, unstable coastal cliffs. In Ireland and Anglesey it is found only in open calcareous flushes and fens. 0-390 m (Helbeck Wood, Westmorland).|Native|This species declined dramatically before 1930, especially in East Anglia. Since then the losses have continued, but at a reduced rate. Most losses are due to scrub encroachment, the closing of woodland canopies, woodland clearance and drainage of fens.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Ophrys sphegodes|A winter-green, short-lived perennial tuberous herb of ancient, species-rich, heavily grazed grassland on chalk and Purbeck limestone. It can, however, tolerate taller grassland, and has also been found colonising disturbed ground in limestone quarries, old spoil heaps and by tracks. Lowland.|Native|O. sphegodes declined severely before 1930, becoming extinct in twelve vice-counties. Most losses were due to ploughing of grassland and changes in grazing regimes, to which it is particularly vulnerable. Its distribution is now stable, and new sites are occasionally found.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.
Orchis laxiflora|A tuberous perennial herb of base-rich or calcareous wet meadows and marshy fields. Lowland.|Native|O. laxiflora has decreased since the early 20th century due to the intensification of agriculture and development, but sites in both Jersey and Guernsey are now protected and their populations have been stable since 1970. Recent molecular studies indicate that this species may be more appropriately treated under Anacamptis (Bateman et al., 1997).|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Orchis mascula|This tuberous perennial herb grows on a variety of neutral and calcareous soils, and is most frequent in woodland, coppices and calcareous grassland. However, it also occurs in hedgerows, scrub, on roadsides and railway banks and on limestone pavement and moist cliff ledges. 0-880 m (Caenlochan, Angus).|Native|This species, mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, has declined in some areas, particularly C. England and parts of Scotland. Most losses are due to woodland felling and coniferisation, intensification of grassland management and ploughing. However, it is much better recorded now, especially in Ireland.|European Temperate element.     © R. Stewart, IWNHAS
Orchis militaris|A tuberous perennial herb found on chalk in grassland, scrub, woodland glades and a chalk-pit. It was planted on industrial waste ground in S. Lancashire, and in new sites in Cambridgeshire and Kent. Lowland.|Native|Habitat destruction and collecting caused a decline in this species until it was considered extinct in the 1920s. It was re-found in Buckinghamshire in 1947 and Suffolk in 1954, where populations are stable, and it appears sporadically in two Oxfordshire sites.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Orchis morio|A tuberous perennial herb of damp to dry, base-rich to mildly acidic soils. It is most frequent in hay meadows and pastures, but also grows on sand dunes, heaths and roadsides, and in quarries, gravel-pits, churchyards and lawns. 0-305 m (Co. Dublin).|Native|The steady decline of this species due to the ploughing and improvement of grasslands has taken place throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. It is often present in only small numbers in 10-km squares where it was once more frequent. Molecular studies indicate that it may be more appropriately placed in Anacamptis (Bateman et al., 1997).|European Temperate element.     © IWNHAS
Orchis purpurea|This long-lived tuberous perennial herb is found on thin calcareous soils, typically over chalk but also on clay, ragstone and Carboniferous limestone. It grows in open Corylus, Fagus or Fraxinus woodland and scrub and, more rarely, in open grassland. Lowland.|Native|This species suffered losses in its core Kent area, largely before 1930, but now appears to be stable there. It was last recorded from Sussex in 1976. Elsewhere, it was recorded once in Herefordshire in 1967, it appears to be flourishing at its Oxfordshire site, where it was found in 1961, and it was discovered in W. Gloucestershire in 1991.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Orchis simia|This perennial, tuberous herb is found on S.-facing banks in grazed chalk grassland. It is tolerant of some degree of shade from scrub, and can also grow on woodland edges. Lowland.|Native|First recorded in 1777 in Kent, this species declined in the 19th century through the ploughing of downland, and was thought to have become extinct in Britain until the extant native Kent population was found in 1955. Seed from this site was used to established a second population in Kent. In 1974, a few plants appeared in S.E. Yorkshire, but these only persisted until 1983. The extant Oxfordshire and Kent populations are increasing, assisted by management of grazing.|European Southern-temperate element.
Orchis ustulata|This tuberous perennial herb requires warm, dry conditions and is often found in tightly grazed chalk and limestone grassland on S.-facing slopes. It also occurs on sandy and gravelly soils in river meadows and on sand dunes. Lowland.|Native|The spectacular decline of this species has been well-documented. Losses have been largely due to changes in agricultural practices, such as ploughing and the cessation of grazing, and through habitat destruction by building and quarrying. Recent molecular studies indicate that it may be more appropriately treated under Neotinea (Bateman et al., 1997).|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Oreopteris limbosperma|A fern of acidic, peaty or humus-rich soils in open woodland, along drainage ditches and streamsides, and on damp heaths, upland grassland and damp rock ledges. It is especially associated with the edges of watercourses, including man-made ditches, and is therefore more frequent on poorly-drained substrates. 0-1010 m (Ben Ime, Main Argyll).|Native|The distribution of this species in the uplands is stable. Many of the losses in the lowlands occurred before 1930, caused especially by the destruction of heathland.|European Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Origanum vulgare|This herbaceous perennial herb of dry, infertile, calcareous soils is found in grassland, hedge banks, and scrub, and is a colonist of bare or sparsely vegetated ground, including quarries and road verges. It is occasionally naturalised from gardens. It is intolerant of heavy grazing. 0-410 m (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|O. vulgare was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined slightly except in the main areas of chalk and limestone soils.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Ornithogalum angustifolium|A bulbous perennial herb of rough pasture, dry, grassy banks and open woods. Lowland.|Neophyte|O. angustifolium is treated here as an introduction, although some authors (e.g. Trist, 1979; Petch & Swann, 1968) consider it to be native on sandy soils in Breckland. It was cultivated in Britain by 1548 and was first recorded in the wild in 1650, but not in Breckland until 1772. It has long been confused with the closely related O. umbellatum, which may be the more commonly cultivated species. The relative frequency of the two species in naturalised populations of Ornithogalum requires further clarification.|A European Southern-temperate species; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Ornithogalum pyrenaicum|A bulbous perennial herb of Fraxinus-Ulmus woodland, hedgerows, road verges and rough grassy banks on calcareous soils, and a particular feature of green lanes on the borders of Somerset and Wiltshire. Lowland.|Native|There has been no significant change in the range of O. pyrenaicum since the 1962 Atlas, but some woodland populations appear to have succumbed to ecological changes following the loss of mature elms. It was formerly harvested, sometimes on a commercial scale, as a native equivalent to asparagus, and is occasionally grown in gardens, sometimes escaping and becoming naturalised.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.
Ornithopus perpusillus|A winter-annual of short, open grassland on free-draining acidic sands and gravels; also around rock outcrops, on sand dunes and in bare patches on dry heathland. It is frequently found on drought-prone, sunny banks beside tracks and paths, and can quickly colonise bare areas after fires and other disturbances. Generally lowland, but reaching 380 m at Ettrick (Selkirks.).|Native|There has been no significant change in the distribution of O. perpusillus in England since the 1962 Atlas, but it appears to be more widespread in Wales, Scotland and Ireland than previously thought.|Suboceanic Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Ornithopus pinnatus|An annual found on dry heaths and heathy grassland, around granite cairns, in consolidated dune turf and in disturbed areas such as gardens and bulb-fields with sandy soil. Inland it is a rare casual of docks and waste ground. Lowland.|Native|Populations of O. pinnatus in the Channel Islands and the Isles of Scilly appear to be stable. Reports of it growing on the Cornish mainland remain unconfirmed (French et al., 1999).|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Orobanche alba|An annual, or possibly perennial, root parasite of Thymus polytrichus. Its principal habitat is base-rich rocky coastal slopes, but it also occurs inland on stabilised scree below limestone outcrops in N. England. Generally lowland, but reaching c. 490 m at Nappa Scar, Wensleydale (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|Populations of O. alba can vary greatly in size from year to year, but the overall range of the species appears to be stable. It is probably still present in many of the Scottish squares where it has not been recorded since 1987.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Orobanche artemisiae-campestris|An annual or perennial occurring mainly on the ledges and fine calcareous debris of coastal chalk cliffs where it parasitises species of Asteraceae, especially Picris hieracioides. Lowland.|Native|This species is probably decreasing. Populations are usually quite small and some have been lost as a result of cliff falls and erosion. The inland records mapped in the 1962 Atlas are now thought to be erroneous (Stace, 1997).|European Southern-temperate element.
Orobanche caryophyllacea|A root parasite mainly of Galium mollugo and G. verum, probably perennial and sometimes long-lived. It occurs in stabilised dune grassland, and in scrub and hedge banks on chalk downs and undercliffs. Most populations are small, but some of those on dunes are of a considerable size. Lowland.|Native|Populations of this species on the North Downs (E. Kent) are vulnerable, and may be declining because of habitat change, but those on dunes seem reasonably secure. Native records from other parts of Britain, including Scotland, are now considered to be errors.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Orobanche elatior|Apparently perennial, this species is almost exclusively parasitic upon Centaurea scabiosa, and is mainly found in chalk and limestone grassland. It may also form substantial populations in man-made habitats such as road verges, railway banks and quarries. Lowland.|Native|There appears to have been a gradual contraction in the range of O. elatior, especially in areas outside its core range where populations tend to be small. Most losses are probably due to habitat destruction. The distribution is stable in its core areas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Orobanche hederae|An annual or perennial parasite which grows on the roots of Hedera helix, especially subsp. hibernica, and, rarely, on other cultivated Araliaceae. Its habitat is that of its host and includes coastal cliffs, open rocky woodland, quarries, hedge banks and other similar habitats. Lowland.|Native|Western populations of O. hederae in coastal habitats appear to be stable. In S.E. England it has been recorded with increasing frequency in artificial habitats, including gardens, where it is probably introduced, although the possibility of long-range dispersal of the light seeds cannot always be ruled out.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Orobanche minor|This usually annual root parasite occurs on a wide range of hosts, but mainly on species of Fabaceae and Asteraceae. Var. maritima is native on sand dunes and cliffs on the south coast (Stewart et al., 1994), with Daucus carota subsp. gummifer as its main host. Var. minor, the most frequent of several poorly differentiated varieties, is probably alien. It is usually found on cultivated land (often introduced with grass seed) and other disturbed ground. Lowland.|Native|The frequent introductions of this species give it a dynamic distribution, so that long-term trends in frequency are difficult to assess.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Orobanche purpurea|An annual or possibly perennial herb, parasitic on Achillea millefolium. It typically occurs on dry, somewhat basic soils in cliff-top grassland and on roadsides and grassy banks, usually near the sea. More rarely, it occurs in disturbed artificial habitats. Flowers can reappear after decades of absence, suggesting that the seeds are long-lived or that plants can persist without flowering for many years. Lowland.|Native|In recent years the loss or decline of some populations of this species has to some extent been balanced by the appearance, or re-appearance, of others. The population at Maryport docks (Cumberland) has increased rapidly since it was first found in 1983.|European Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Orobanche rapum-genistae|A perennial root parasite of leguminous shrubs, especially Ulex europaeus and Cytisus scoparius, but also known to occur occasionally on Genista tinctoria. Its habitat, governed by that of its hosts, is mainly scrub, but hedge banks and track-sides are also favoured. Lowland.|Native|This species suffered a dramatic decline in the 19th and early 20th century. This is largely unexplained, although changes in land-use were probably at least partly responsible. The decline appears to have halted by 1950, and subsequently populations have been found at a greater rate than they have been lost.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Orobanche reticulata|Probably perennial, this root parasite of thistles occurs in rough grassland, on road verges, and especially on river margins and flood plains where its frequent, sometimes transient, occurrence suggests that seed is readily dispersed by water. It is almost restricted to Magnesian limestone districts. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of O. reticulata appears to be stable, although many new populations have recently been found.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; also in C. Asia. Our plant is subsp. procera, which has a lowland distribution in Europe and is quite distinct from the montane subsp. reticulata.
Orthilia secunda|A rhizomatous, mycorrhizal, evergreen perennial herb, of damp Calluna and Vaccinium-dominated communities, mostly in Pinus and Betula woodland but also on open moorland. It also grows in clefts and on ledges in rocky gullies, and on rocky stream banks. Flowering is often erratic. From 30 Kirkhill, Easterness) to 690 m (Craig an Dail, S. Aberdeen).|Native|Poor recruitment means that the distribution has been reduced historically by fire, grazing and other moorland management practices. However, it is not clear whether it has continued to decline since 1970.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Osmunda regalis|A large fern found on neutral or acidic substrates in fen-carr woodland and ditches, and on riverbanks and rocky lake shores. In W. Ireland it also grows in wet fields, mires and, more rarely, on limestone sea-cliffs. It is often confined to inaccessible sites in grazed areas. Lowland to 365 m in S. Kerry.|Native|O. regalis was heavily collected in Victorian times for cultivation and osmunda fibre. This, and habitat loss, caused its decline, though it is now recovering in some areas and few sites have been lost since the 1962 Atlas.

Otanthus maritimus|A perennial herb of sand dunes and stabilised shingle. Lowland.|Native|First recorded in our area in the early 17th century, this species has undergone a major decline since 1850. It is now restricted as a native to just two sites in Co. Wexford, where populations appear to be stable; it has been introduced to a third locality. It is extinct in Britain, the last records being from Cornwall in 1933 and the Isles of Scilly in 1936. It was last recorded in the Channel Islands (on Jersey) in 1926.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; more frequent on stable Mediterranean beaches than on the stormy Atlantic coast.
Oxalis acetosella|A perennial creeping herb of woodland, hedgerows, banks, and other moist, usually shaded, habitats; also in rough montane grassland, grikes in limestone pavement, Vaccinium communities, bryophyte-rich block screes, and rock ledges. It grows on both calcareous and non-calcareous soils, though only those which are moisture-retentive. It is one of the few species able to survive the deep shade of conifer plantations. 0-1160 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of O. acetosella has little changed since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`.

Oxalis articulata|A vigorous rhizomatous perennial herb occasionally naturalised in disturbed areas, on waste ground, roadsides and seashores, but always associated with human habitation. It reproduces mainly by semi-woody rhizome fragments, though some seed-set is reported. Lowland.|Neophyte|O. articulata was introduced in 1870, and is now frequently grown in gardens as an ornamental. It was known from the wild by 1912, and is thought to be increasing, although such changes are difficult to assess.|Native of temperate S. America.
Oxalis corniculata|A scrambling annual or short-lived perennial herb which is often a pernicious weed of cultivated land, disturbed areas and paths. It is self-compatible and the seeds are explosively ejected up to two metres from the capsules. Its brittle stems readily root at the nodes. Lowland.|Neophyte|O. corniculata was cultivated in Britain by 1656 and was first recorded in the wild in 1770, but the main spread has been in the 20th century and this has continued since the 1962 Atlas. It has consolidated its range in the south, and is now more widely recorded in N. Britain and Ireland.|Native range unknown; now found in warm temperate and tropical regions throughout the world.
Oxalis debilis|A bulbous perennial herb, formerly widely grown as an ornamental and readily becoming naturalised in gardens and on waste ground. It spreads rapidly by easily detached bulblets that are resistant to all but the strongest herbicides, and in places it has become an almost ineradicable weed. Lowland.|Neophyte|Introduced in 1826, O. debilis has spread slowly, despite its weedy nature and ability to become naturalised. It was recorded in the wild by 1900.|Native of temperate S. America.
Oxalis exilis|A small, prostrate annual or short-lived perennial herb grown in garden rockeries, escaping into habitats such as disturbed ground, pathsides, the base of walls, and crevices in paved areas, in shaded or open situations. Most populations are casual, but in some sites it is known to have persisted for many years. Lowland.|Neophyte|As O. exilis is often mistaken for small forms of O. corniculata, and it was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas, it is difficult to assess changes in its distribution. It was first recorded in the wild in 1926, and may be under-recorded.|Native of Australasia.
Oxalis incarnata|A perennial bulbous herb with annual erect branching stems. It is cultivated in gardens, occasionally escaping to nearby disturbed, shaded sites, hedge banks, stone walls and pavement cracks. It does not set seed, but spreads by bulblets produced in the axils of the aerial stems. Lowland.|Neophyte|O. incarnata was cultivated in Britain by 1739 and recorded in the wild by 1912 (Middlesex). Changes in its distribution are not easily assessed.|Native of S. Africa.
Oxalis latifolia|A bulbous perennial which was formerly grown as an ornamental. It is a weed of nurseries and gardens, from which it spreads to rubbish tips and other sites where garden refuse is dumped. It does not set seed, but spreads vigorously by easily detached bulblets that are resistant to all but the strongest herbicides. Lowland.|Neophyte|O. latifolia was recorded in the wild by 1921. It is less frost-hardy than the similar O. debilis, and was very considerably reduced in Guernsey in the severe 1962-3 winter, although it soon recovered (McClintock, 1975). Changes in its distribution cannot be readily assessed.|Native of S. & C. America; now a notorious agricultural weed of mild climates worldwide.
Oxalis pes-caprae|This bulbous perennial herb is naturalised as a weed of agriculture, especially in bulb-fields, in milder areas. It does not set seed, but spreads vigorously by easily detached underground bulblets that are resistant to all but the strongest herbicides. Outside the Channel Islands and Isles of Scilly, populations are usually casual. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was introduced into cultivation in Britain in 1757. It was recorded from the wild in 1901 (Guernsey).|Native of S. Africa; widely naturalised in the Mediterranean region.
Oxalis stricta|An erect annual of cultivated ground, disturbed areas and paths, in shaded or semi-shaded situations. It spreads by seed or occasionally by underground rhizomes. Seed is freely set by self-pollination, and forcibly ejected from the capsules over a distance of up to two metres. Lowland.|Neophyte|O. stricta was cultivated in Britain by 1658 and has long been frequent in S. England; it was recorded from the wild by 1823. It has spread westwards since the 1962 Atlas. Most populations are casual, but is has been known to persist for many years in some places.|Native of N. America and E. Asia; extensively naturalised in temperate Europe.
Oxyria digyna|A tufted perennial herb of damp, ungrazed mountain ledges, wet, shaded gullies and the sides of gills and streams. In Scotland it sometimes descends to near sea level along streams, but usually occurs above 150 m, reaching 1190 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no change in distribution of O. digyna since the 1962 Atlas, and it is probably still present in many of the more remote 10-km squares in Scotland for which there are only pre-1970 records.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Oxytropis campestris|A tufted perennial herb, confined in Britain to limestone and calcareous schists, where it grows in open communities of a southerly to south-westerly aspect. Its two inland sites are upland, between 500 and 640 m at Clova (Angus), but its third site is on sea-cliffs between 25 and 180 m.|Native|Populations of this relict species seem quite stable, despite past collecting and current grazing regimes.|Eurasian Arctic-montane element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Oxytropis halleri|A perennial herb found on mountain rock ledges and grassy slopes on Dalradian limestone and schists, and on base-rich sandstone sea-cliffs and calcareous sand dunes. The larger populations occur at coastal sites in Sutherland. From sea level at Bettyhill (W. Sutherland) to 760 m on Ben Vrackie (E. Perth).|Native|Apart from losses in the 19th century, the distribution of this species appears to be stable, although some sites may be suffering from over-grazing and others from scrub encroachment.|European Boreal-montane element, but absent from the Boreal zonobiome. In mainland Europe O. halleri is strictly montane.
Panicum miliaceum|This large, tufted annual is a frequent bird- and oil-seed casual on rubbish tips, waste ground and in woodland around pheasant feeding areas; also occurring as a grain contaminant in arable crops, especially maize. Lowland.|Casual|P. miliaceum was introduced to cultivation by 1596 and was first recorded in the wild in Britain in 1872. It appears to be increasing in many areas, but probably remains under-recorded.|Originally domesticated in C. & E. Asia but now grown in warm-temperate and tropical regions throughout the world.
Papaver argemone|An annual of arable crops, usually found on field edges and in unsprayed corners, often in small numbers. It is most frequent on light sandy, gravelly and chalky soils. Rarely, it occurs on waste ground. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|P. argemone, mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, is susceptible to herbicides and has declined because of this. Some marginal losses may only have been casual populations.|As an archaeophyte P. argemone has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Papaver dubium|An annual found principally in arable fields, where it can occur on both light and heavy calcareous soils. It is also found on waste ground by roadsides and railways, and in gardens. The seed is very long-lived. Lowland, but with one record at 425 m in Atholl (E. Perth).|Archaeophyte|P. dubium was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined locally as a result of agricultural intensification, but its overall distribution is stable. Subsp. dubium and subsp. lecoqii are mapped separately.|As an archaeophyte P. dubium has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Papaver hybridum|This annual occurs in arable crops, and sometimes in other disturbed habitats. It is most frequent on chalky soils, but also grows on other limestones and on calcareous sands. The seed, which can be long-lived, germinates in both autumn and spring. 0-320 m (Buxton, Derbys.).|Archaeophyte|Many of the losses of this species took place before 1930. Although it is thought to have decreased in abundance since 1950 due to the increased use of herbicides, this is not reflected at the 10-km scale where its distribution is more or less stable.|As an archaeophyte P. hybridum has a Submediterranean-Subatlantic distribution.     © L. Rooney
Papaver rhoeas|An annual of arable fields and other disturbed and open habitats. It is most frequent on light, calcareous soils. It is sensitive to herbicide, but can be abundant in unsprayed strips in fields. Its seed can be very long-lived. It is also frequent in wild-flower seed mixtures and occurs as a garden escape. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Although there have been losses around the edges of its range, the overall distribution is remarkably stable.|As an archaeophyte P. rhoeas has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © Shannon, P
Papaver somniferum|An annual occurring as a casual garden escape on roadsides, waste ground and rubbish tips, and occasionally in arable fields as a relic of cultivation for poppy seed. Lowland, with one record at 410 m (Eisteddfa Gurig, Cards.).|Archaeophyte|This species is a medicinal, culinary and ornamental plant. Its seeds have been found in Bronze Age archaeological deposits and are frequently found from the Iron Age onwards. It is widely cultivated as a garden plant. Subsp. somniferum is the common taxon, whilst subsp. setigerum is a rare casual which might be a distinct species (Stace, 1997).|Probably native of the eastern Mediterranean region, but native distribution obscured by its spread in cultivation.
Parapholis incurva|An annual of bare places by the sea, including gravelly mud banks, shingle ridges, rock ledges and cliff-tops, and the uppermost parts of saltmarshes; also in artificial habitats such as sea walls and wooden mooring stays. There are rare occurrences around docks and inland as a wool and ballast alien. Lowland.|Native|P. incurva is an extremely inconspicuous species which is much better recorded than it was for the 1962 Atlas. It was discovered in Ireland in 1979. It has been lost from some sites due to coastal reclamation and the upgrading of sea defences.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Parapholis strigosa|An annual of damp barish places by the sea; especially characteristic of the upper parts of grazed Festuca rubra-Puccinellia maritima saltmarshes, but also on mud banks, shingle ridges, saltmarsh-sand dune transitions and sea walls. In W. Britain and Ireland it occurs along rocky coasts in beach-head saltmarshes. Rarely, it grows inland by salt-treated roads. Lowland.|Native|There is no evidence of any appreciable change in the distribution of P. strigosa since the 1962 Atlas. Apparent gains in some areas, especially in Ireland, may be due to it having been overlooked by earlier recorders. The species is inconspicuous and is probably still somewhat under-recorded.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Parentucellia viscosa|A hemiparasitic annual of damp, open grassy places on sandy soils, often by tracks. It normally occurs in drier dune-slacks and in reclaimed heath-pasture, but is also found on pathsides, rough and scrubby grassland and field-borders, and increasingly in re-seeded amenity grasslands and waste places. It thrives on disturbance. Lowland.|Native|This species has increased northwards and eastwards in Britain, largely through introductions from seed mixtures. Conversely, the re-seeding of old pasture has led to some decline over the same period at inland sites in S.W. England. In Ireland, it appears to be relatively stable in the north, but it has declined significantly in the south-west.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Parietaria judaica|A much-branched perennial herb growing from the cracks and mortar crevices of brick and stone walls, on building rubble, rocks, cliffs and steep-sided hedge banks. It prefers dry, sunny, sheltered spots, and is often found in built-up areas or not far from habitation. Lowland.|Native|There appears to have been little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`. Its frequent occurrence on the walls of abbeys and priories is possibly connected to its use by medieval herbalists as a remedy for urinary disorders.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element; also in C. Asia.     © Shannon, P
Paris quadrifolia|A rhizomatous, perennial herb of moist, calcareous, usually ancient, woodland, and occasionally found in grikes on open limestone pavement. It flowers and fruits most freely in the open stages of the coppice cycle, but persists in deep shade, and is well adapted to such conditions in managed woodland. Generally lowland, but reaching 360 m at Great Asby Scar (Westmorland) and Garrigill (Cumberland).|Native|Many sites for P. quadrifolia were lost in N. England and central Scotland before 1930, and since then there has been some decline in S.E. England through the destruction and coniferisation of woodland. It may spread into secondary woods which are adjacent to primary woodland.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Parnassia palustris|A perennial, shortly rhizomatous herb of base-rich flushes in short grassland, mires, fens, dune-slacks and machair. The last two habitats support the coastal ecotype, var. condensata. 0-1005 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|The marked decline in the southern part of its range, mainly due to land drainage, was evident in the 1962 Atlas, and appears to be continuing. This has chiefly affected diploid populations. Its distribution in N. and N.W. Britain and Ireland (tetraploid populations) appears to be stable, though the reasons for the paucity of recent records in N. Scotland are unclear.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Pastinaca sativa|This biennial herb occurs in neutral and calcareous grassland, especially in chalk and limestone districts. It is found in rank swards on downland, on roadsides, railway banks, and rough and uncultivated land. 0-380 m (Stainmore, Westmorland).|Native|There has been little appreciable change in the distribution of P. sativa since the 1962 Atlas, although there have been losses at the edges of its range. It may be increasing in some areas along new roads (Halliday, 1997; French et al., 1999).|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Pedicularis palustris|An annual to biennial root-hemiparasitic herb of a wide range of base-rich to acidic, moist habitats, including wet heaths, valley bogs, wet meadows, ditches, fens and hillside flushes. Its sites are usually more enriched than those preferred by P. sylvatica. 0-550 m (E. Highlands of Scotland).|Native|The decline of P. palustris in C. & S. England and many parts of Ireland was already apparent in the 1962 Atlas and the species has suffered a further substantial decline since then, mostly through habitat loss due to drainage and agricultural improvement. Elsewhere, there are only local losses.|European Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Pedicularis sylvatica|A perennial, rarely biennial, root-hemiparasitic of acidic soils, found on damp grassy heaths, moorlands, upland flushed grasslands and the drier parts of bogs and marshes. 0-915 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|P. sylvatica was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There has been a widespread decline in S. and E. England, which can be attributed to the loss of heathlands and unimproved grasslands. Analysis of the database reveals that most losses have occurred since 1950. Two subspecies occur in our area: subsp. sylvatica occurs throughout the range of the species; subsp. hibernica is mapped separately.|European Temperate element.
Pentaglottis sempervirens|This erect perennial herb is mostly found near habitation in lightly shaded habitats, including waste ground, roadside-banks, hedgerows, scrub and woodland, but it also grows on riversides. It reproduces prolifically from seed and can be very invasive. Generally lowland, but reaching 380 m at Upper Glenlivet (Banffs.).|Neophyte|P. sempervirens, introduced to British gardens before 1700, is frequently grown in gardens. It was known from the wild by 1724. Already widespread at the time of the 1962 Atlas, it has increased further during the past forty years.|Native of S.W. Europe, but naturalised in W. Europe north of its native range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Persicaria amphibia|A floating aquatic perennial herb, which sometimes grows in considerable quantity in lakes, ponds, canals, slow-flowing rivers and ditches, or a terrestrial plant found in damp places on watersides, in marshes, wet meadows and dune-slacks, and as a weed of cultivated land. Reproduction is by seed and fragments of rhizome; terrestrial plants are much less floriferous than aquatic ones. 0-570 m (Blind Tarn, Westmorland).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Persicaria bistorta|A perennial herb of base-poor soils in damp pastures, hay meadows and river-banks, in tall-herb communities in river valleys and on mountain ledges and roadsides. Many colonies originate as garden escapes or throw-outs. 0-430 m above Garrigill (Cumberland).|Native|The native range of P. bistorta is now largely obscured by alien occurrences, and all records are mapped as if they are native. It was lost from many sites in S. England and Ireland before 1930. Although now better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas, its overall range is stable.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, in N. America native in west and naturalised in east so now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Persicaria hydropiper|An annual of damp mud on the margins of ponds and lakes, canals, rivers and streams, or shallow depressions such as vehicle tracks and hoof-marks in woodland rides, around field gateways and in wet meadows. It is almost invariably in sites which are waterlogged in winter, often on base-poor soils and sometimes in partial shade. 0-505 m (Llyn Crugnant, Cards.).|Native|The distribution of P. hydropiper has not changed markedly since the 1962 Atlas, although there have been losses at the eastern edge of its range.|Circumpolar Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Persicaria lapathifolia|An annual of open and disturbed ground on a wide range of soils ranging from sand to clay and peat. It is a poor competitor, found in cultivated fields, on the open margins of lakes, ponds, streams and rivers, and on waste ground. Robust adventive variants have been recorded in waste places and fields treated with wool shoddy. 0-450 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Native|The distribution of P. lapathifolia has not changed appreciably since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Persicaria maculosa|An annual of open ground on a wide range of soils, particularly those which are rich in nutrients. It is found by ponds, lakes, streams and ditches, in waste places, on roadsides and railways, and is sometimes a pestilential weed of cultivated land. Mainly lowland, but ascending to at least 450 m near Garrigill (Cumberland) and in Clun Forest (Salop).|Native|The overall distribution of this species is stable since the 1962 Atlas, although there have been some losses at the northern edge of its range.|Eurasian Temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.
Persicaria minor|An annual of wet marshy places, winter-flooded ground beside ponds, lakes and ditches, or damp pastures trampled by stock. It is found on a wide range of soils, from nutrient-rich muds in pastures to sandy and gravelly lake shores. 0-315 m (Skeggles Water, Westmorland).|Native|While there has been little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas, P. minor is now known from many more 10-km squares. New records from Ireland, S.W. Scotland and Wales increase the known distribution slightly westwards and northwards.|Eurasian Temperate element.
Persicaria mitis|An annual of wet places growing beside ponds, lakes and rivers and in shallow ditches, damp hollows in fields, cattle-trampled places in pasture and abandoned peat cuttings. It grows in nutrient-rich soils, but appears indifferent to soil reaction. Lowland.|Native|P. mitis has been confused with P. hydropiper and P. minor, making interpretation of the map difficult. It is now known from many more 10-km squares since the 1962 Atlas. In Britain, however, populations have been lost through the regulation of water levels, the fencing of ditches, and the filling in of ponds. Webb (1984) suggests that this species is a recent introduction to Ireland.|European Temperate element.
Persicaria vivipara|A short, tufted perennial herb, usually found on base-rich substrates and less frequently in acidic conditions. It grows on wet rocks, consolidated screes, in grassland and in damp flushes in the mountains, and it is often abundant in montane pastures. Reproduction is mostly by bulbils at the base of the inflorescence, frequently carried down to lower levels by streams. It reaches 1210 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth), but descends to near sea level in N. Scotland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Persicaria wallichii|A tall, rhizomatous perennial herb of streamsides, hedge banks, roadsides, railway banks and waste ground, growing in dense stands. Its flowers are heterostylous and seed is only occasionally set in Britain, but it establishes readily by vegetative reproduction from outcast rhizomes. Generally lowland, but reaching 330 m at Simonsbath (S. Somerset).|Neophyte|P. wallichii was introduced to Britain just before 1900, and was first recorded in the wild in 1917. Its distribution has expanded considerably since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of the Himalayas.
Petasites albus|A dioecious rhizomatous perennial herb found established in woods and waste places, on waysides and shady riversides, occasionally forming large stands. The male plant is much more common than the female in our area. Lowland.|Neophyte|P. albus was introduced to Britain by 1683, and naturalised by at least 1843 (W. Yorks.). It shows little overall change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of the mountains of Europe and S.W. Asia.
Petasites fragrans|This dioecious rhizomatous perennial herb is naturalised on streamsides, banks, rough ground and roadsides, where it sometimes forms large, very persistent stands. Lowland.|Neophyte|P. fragrans was introduced in 1806, and the male plant is grown as an ornamental in gardens and some churchyards. It was known in the wild by at least 1835 (Middlesex), and was well established by the start of the 20th century (Dunn, 1905). It appears to be still spreading in Britain and Ireland. Female plants are unknown in our area.|Native of the C. Mediterranean region in Europe (Italy, Sicily, Sardinia) and of N. Africa.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Petasites hybridus|A dioecious rhizomatous perennial herb of moist, fertile, often alluvial, soils by watercourses, in wet meadows, marshes, flood plains and copses, and on roadsides. It spreads mostly vegetatively from rhizome fragments. Female plants are frequent only in N. and C. England. Male-only colonies are probably single clones, many perhaps from deliberate plantings for a source of pollen and nectar for hive bees (Stevens, 1990). 0-380 m (near Garrigill, Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of P. hybridus is little changed since the 1962 Atlas. Although many populations may be alien, they are rarely recorded as such.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Petrorhagia nanteuilii|As a native plant, this annual is recorded from thinly vegetated, stabilised shingle in Britain and from stabilised dunes in Jersey. It is also recorded as an introduction around dockyards, in re-seeded grassland and as a garden weed. Lowland.|Native|The map in the 1962 Atlas combined records of P. nanteuilii and P. prolifera; P. nanteuilii sens. str. was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968). Some P. nanteuilii sites were lost to building development between 1850 and 1930. It was last seen in Kent in 1960 and was thought to have become extinct in Hampshire in 1968, until refound there 30 years later. It is, however, still locally frequent in Jersey.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Petrorhagia prolifera|An autumn-germinating annual of freely-draining substrates. In Norfolk, it has most recently been recorded from the open edge of sandy grass-heath where it abuts a roadway, and in Bedfordshire from a sand-pit. Lowland.|Neophyte|Early British records of Petrorhagia cannot be identified to the two species currently recognised. Current populations in Norfolk date from 1835; it was known at several sites until the 1950s, but not seen again until 1985. Although it is treated here as an introduction, it is arguably native in Norfolk and possibly in Suffolk (Akeroyd & Beckett, 1995). It is well-established in Bedfordshire but a casual elsewhere.|A European Temperate species.
Petrorhagia prolifera sens.lat.||||
Petroselinum crispum|A biennial herb which forms small but persistent colonies on cliffs, banks and waste ground in coastal areas. These colonies usually have uncrisped leaves. The crisped form which is commonly grown in gardens occurs as a casual close to habitation both near the sea and inland. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|P. crispum has been cultivated in British gardens since at least 995 (Harvey, 1981). Although most records are casual, it is very persistent in many of its coastal sites. It is difficult to assess any changes in its distribution.|A cultivated species of uncertain origin which is now widely naturalised in Europe and other continents.
Petroselinum segetum|This slender biennial of well-drained calcareous soils on clay or chalk is found on arable fields margins, on grassy banks, roadsides, railway banks, river banks, by sea walls, in drained estuarine marshes, on rough waste ground and occasionally as a garden weed. Lowland.|Native|P. segetum was thought to be declining at the time of the 1962 Atlas. Whilst it has undoubtedly been lost from some 10-km squares, many more new records have been added since 1962.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Peucedanum officinale|This perennial herb of coastal grassland occurs in rough grassland and scrubby places adjoining saltmarsh or brackish grazing marsh, on creek sides and on sea walls; also on waste ground and, rarely, on roadsides. Plants spread by rhizomatous growth, but seed ripens only in warm years. Lowland.|Native|This species was recorded in 1666 in Sussex, but has not been seen there subsequently. It appears to have become more frequent in Essex since 1950, though some outlying populations have been lost. Its discovery in 1990 at Southwold, E. Suffolk, is a significant extension of its range.|European Southern-temperate element.
Peucedanum ostruthium|A perennial herb naturalised in moist or damp grassy areas, including marshy pasture, on hillsides and by streams and rivers, and sometimes established around farm buildings. Generally lowland, but reaching 385 m at Langdon Beck (Co. Durham).|Archaeophyte|P. ostruthium was formerly cultivated as a pot-herb or for veterinary purposes. It is very persistent and shows no sign of a change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of the mountains of C. & S.W. Europe.
Peucedanum palustre|A biennial or short-lived perennial herb, mainly growing on permanently damp peat, often in sites flooded in winter. It is most characteristic of tall-herb fen, being found in both cut and uncut stands. It can survive in fen scrub and alder-carr, and it occurs rarely in marshes and damp pasture. Lowland.|Native|Many sites of P. palustre were lost in the 19th century, following drainage and reclamation. Since 1930, further sites have been lost in East Anglia, principally to scrub invasion. Most extant sites are in nature reserves.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Phalaris arundinacea|A rhizomatous perennial herb of ditches, river banks, Alnus-Salix carr and the margins of canals, reservoirs, lakes and ponds, growing especially well where the water-table fluctuates widely. It prefers slightly drier sites than Glyceria maxima and Phragmites australis, and can occur on roadsides. 0-475 m (Llyn y Figyn, Cards.) and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|There is no evidence of any change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas. Its ability to tolerate summer-dry conditions has enabled it to survive in the modern landscape.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G.

Phalaris canariensis|An annual of waste ground, rubbish tips, walls, roadsides and pavement cracks, especially in built-up areas. It is a casual, rarely persisting, from bird-seed, grain and, possibly, wool shoddy. Generally lowland, but reaching 430 m at Nenthead (Cumberland).|Neophyte|P. canariensis was recorded in the wild as early as 1632. Comparison with the 1962 Atlas suggests that losses have been balanced by new records.|Perhaps native to N.W. Africa and the Canary Islands; widely naturalised in the Mediterranean region and in other continents.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Phalaris minor|This annual is usually found as a casual on rubbish dumps and waste ground, but is sometimes established amongst arable crops, including bulb-fields in the Isles of Scilly and carrot fields in East Anglia. It mainly originates from grain, bird-seed, wool and esparto. Lowland.|Neophyte|P. minor was noted by Ryves et al. (1996) as possibly native in the Channel Islands, where it was known in the wild as early as 1791, but most Phalaris species were spreading by then and it is probably alien there. It is almost certainly under-recorded.|A Mediterranean-Atlantic species; very widely naturalised outside its native range.
Phegopteris connectilis|A creeping, rhizomatous fern, most common in ancient woodlands dominated by Quercus petraea on neutral to acidic soils, where it frequently occurs on deeper soils on gully sides where base-rich water percolates. It can also be found amongst boulders and on wet rock faces in the uplands where it is afforded protection from grazing. 0-1120 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of P. connectilis is stable.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Phleum alpinum|A loosely tufted perennial herb usually found over damp, calcareous or base-enriched substrates in the mountains. It occurs in a variety of habitats, including moist or dry cliff-faces, corrie rock ledges and wet grassy slopes. From 610 m on Braeriach (S. Aberdeen) to 1220 m on Cairntoul (S. Aberdeen).|Native|P. alpinum normally occurs in lightly grazed or ungrazed habitats, and heavy grazing may be partly responsible for its present restriction in some areas. However, there is no evidence of widespread decline, and it probably still persists undetected in some squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.     © Linda Robinson
Phleum arenarium|An annual of coastal sand dunes and sandy shingle, usually on mobile or semi-fixed Ammophila dunes and frequently associated with winter-annuals such as Aira praecox, Myosotis ramosissima and Vulpia fasciculata; also inland in Breckland, on open grass-heaths, wind-blown sand banks and other disturbed, open, sandy areas. It is a rare casual inland, sometimes arriving with imported sea-sand. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of P. arenarium since the 1962 Atlas, other than a continuing decline in the Breckland which may be caused by the decrease of mobile, sandy habitats.|European Southern-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Phleum bertolonii|A perennial herb of old meadows and pastures, downs, roadside-banks and waste places; often with P. pratense, but showing a preference for slightly thinner swards and drier, less fertile soils. It occasionally occurs as a wool-alien, on shoddy fields and rubbish tips. Lowland.|Native|This taxon was not separately mapped in the 1962 Atlas. There is much confusion between P. pratense and P. bertolonii, and distributional trends cannot be assessed using existing data; robust agricultural strains of P. bertolonii are distinguishable from small P. pratense only by their differing chromosome number (Halliday, 1997). It is particularly under-recorded in Ireland.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Phleum phleoides|A perennial herb of open habitats on free-draining sandy or chalky soils, especially in Breckland where it occurs on grazed grass-heaths, road verges and track-side banks, and in the vicinity of pits, rabbit warrens and other disturbed places. Lowland.|Native|Most losses of P. phleoides occurred before 1930. Since then, its known range has been extended eastwards; its easternmost site, at Stuston Common (E. Suffolk), was first discovered in 1991. It is thriving in open habitats in Breckland.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Phleum pratense|A perennial herb growing in a wide range of grassy habitats, including meadows, pastures, rough grassland, field margins and waysides; also sown in grasslands and as a casual from wool shoddy, bird-seed and other sources. P. pratense sens. str. tends to occur on rather heavier, damper soils than P. bertolonii. 0-445 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Native|P. pratense sens. str. was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas, being included with P. bertolonii within the map of P. pratense sens. lat. These two taxa are still much confused. Native and alien records have seldom been distinguished.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.
Phleum pratense sens.lat.|These grasses grow in a wide range of grassy habitats, such as meadows and pastures, rough grassland, field margins, verges and waste places. They are common in sown grasslands and frequent casuals from wool shoddy, bird-seed and other sources. 0?445 m (Clun Forest, Salop), and exceptionally at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|This aggregate comprises P. pratense sens. str. and P. bertolonii. There has been little change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas. Much seed sown as leys comes from N. America. It has not been possible to distinguish native and introduced records, except in S. W. Ireland and the Northern Isles.|The distributions of the two component species are given in the following accounts.
Phragmites australis|A rhizomatous and stoloniferous herb of swamps and fens, forming large stands in shallow water in ditches, rivers, lakes and ponds; also in brackish swamps and lagoons, and in freshwater seepages on sheltered sea-cliffs. It is frequently planted beside artificial water bodies. Generally lowland, but reaching 470 m on Brown Clee Hill (Salop).|Native|The distribution is broadly stable, though local losses have been noted, such as the die-back of reed-beds in Broadland in the last fifty years. However, it has increased in some areas due to eutrophication, and some reed-beds have been created for breeding birds.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Phyllitis scolopendrium|An evergreen perennial fern of sheltered, humid, moist habitats, including rocky woodlands, stream and hedge banks, grikes in limestone pavement, and on brickwork and walls, where it often grows in a stunted form. It avoids the most acidic substrates. 0-700 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|The range of this species appears to be unchanged since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`, although it is now better recorded. Although treated here as Phyllitis scolopendrium, it is clear from molecular evidence that the genus Phyllitis should be subsumed into Asplenium.|European Temperate element; also in E. Asia and N. America.
Phyllodoce caerulea|This low shrub occurs in acidic, free-draining sites on steep, usually N.- to E.-facing rocky mountain slopes. It is usually found in dwarf shrub communities, though it sometimes occurs in herb-rich grassland. All sites have a prolonged snow-lie. Flowering is irregular, and seed production generally poor. 670-800 m (Ben Alder Forest, Westerness).|Native|P. caerulea was discovered in Britain in 1810. The 10-km distribution is stable, but negligible recruitment, together with losses from erosion, means that populations have somewhat declined since detailed studies began in 1985.|European Arctic-montane element; also in C. and E. Asia and N. America.
Physospermum cornubiense|This rhizomatous perennial herb is often found in substantial, loose colonies in open woodland, in Ulex scrub on heaths, on rough grassy slopes (often in stream valleys), in Molinia grassland, and on shaded roadside banks. Reproduction is by seed, and the plant regenerates strongly after burning or clearance. Lowland.|Native|Since the late 1970s the number of sites of P. cornubiense has fallen from nearly fifty to about twenty, and populations have also strongly declined. This may be attributed to factors rendering its habitats more densely shaded or destroying them altogether, including the lack of woodland management, afforestation, scrub clearance and the loss of grazing.|European Temperate element.
Phyteuma orbiculare|A perennial herb of species-rich chalk grassland, open scrub, earthworks and verges. It is tolerant of grazing, and seems to prefer grazed areas, but also grows in neighbouring ungrazed grassland. Propagation is mostly by seed but it also spreads by stoloniferous growth. Lowland.|Native|This species was last recorded before 1930 in most of the squares for which there is no recent record. Its 10-km square distribution now appears to be stable, although some sites have been lost through ploughing of chalk grassland or its agricultural improvement.|European Boreo-temperate element; at low altitudes in W. Europe and in mountains of C. Europe.
Phyteuma spicatum|A long-lived perennial herb of damp, fertile, acid soils on road verges, streamsides and in coppiced woodland. Reproduction is by seed, which is long-lived, but recruitment at some sites is negligible. Lowland.|Native|P. spicatum has been grown for centuries as a medicinal plant, and was first recorded in the wild in 1640. Plants in Sussex were first recorded in 1824, suggesting that although traditionally regarded as native, it might be an introduction there. It was formerly more widespread and more abundant within this stronghold. It cannot tolerate shade and has disappeared from many sites through a lack of coppicing.|European Temperate element.
Picea abies|An evergreen tree of plantations and shelter-belts, grown in a wide variety of soils but not suited to deep peat, dry soils and exposed situations. It seeds freely, and natural regeneration occurs in open ground, in clear-felled areas and on heathland. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Neophyte|P. abies, native to Britain in previous interglacials, has been cultivated in gardens since 995 (Harvey, 1981) and was recorded in the wild by 1927. Although less popular than P. sitchensis, it is still much planted for timber, pulping and Christmas trees.|A Eurasian Boreal-montane species; absent as a native from W. Europe.
Picea sitchensis|An evergreen tree of plantations, especially on wetter ground, in high rainfall areas and in exposed sites. It regenerates freely in open ground, in areas of clear felling, and on Calluna heath. 0-690 m (where it has been reported as regenerating near Stuc a` Chroin, W. Perth), and probably higher.|Neophyte|Introduced in 1832, P. sitchensis is now the most frequently planted conifer in our area, dominating huge areas of former moorland and bog. However, it is now being planted more often at lower altitudes. It was known from the wild by 1957.|Native of coastal forests in western N. America; widely planted in N.W. & C. Europe.
Picris echioides|An annual or biennial herb of open grassland, roadsides, field margins, cliffs and scree slopes, river banks, sea walls and waste places, especially on lime-rich clay soils. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|P. echioides was mapped with a somewhat patchy distribution in the 1962 Atlas, being found mainly south of a line from the Severn to the Humber. Since then it has consolidated within that range. It is only casual in Scotland.|As an archaeophyte P. echioides has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Picris hieracioides|A biennial or perennial herb, mainly of calcareous soils, occurring in the less heavily grazed swards in chalk and limestone grassland, on roadsides and railway banks, and in quarries and lime-pits. It is intolerant of heavy grazing and is a poor competitor in dense vegetation. Lowland.|Native|P. hieracioides has shown little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas, though there have been some losses in the northern and eastern parts of its range. It has been introduced to Ireland, where it has spread towards the south and west along railways.|Eurasian Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Pilosella aurantiaca|A stoloniferous or rhizomatous perennial herb, which has escaped from gardens and become naturalised on railway and roadside banks, on walls and in churchyards and other grassy and waste places. 0-445 m (Nenthead, Cumberland).|Neophyte|P. aurantiaca was grown in gardens by 1629 and recorded from the wild by 1793. Two subspecies are recognised in our area, subsp. aurantiaca and subsp. carpathicola. Although expertly determined records of these were mapped by Perring & Sell (1968), they have not been comprehensively recorded since then and are not mapped separately here.|P. aurantiaca has a European Boreal-montane distribution; it is naturalised outside this range in Europe, N. America and elsewhere.
Pilosella flagellaris||||
Pilosella flagellaris subsp.bicapitata|An endemic perennial herb of grassy limestone rocky outcrops, heathy granulitic gneiss and feldspathic rocky sea-banks in three localities in Shetland, where it was first described in 1962. Lowland.|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of this subspecies at the 10-km scale. However, two of its three localities are accessible to sheep, and the increased grazing in recent years has suppressed flowering and might have reduced the populations. The occurrence of this endemic subspecies in Shetland at such a distance from native populations of subsp. flagellaris in C. & S. Europe presents a fascinating problem in plant distribution.|Endemic.
Pilosella flagellaris subsp.flagellaris|A perennial, stoloniferous herb, sometimes grown in gardens and found naturalised on roadsides and railway banks. Reproduction is by seed and vegetative spread. Lowland.|Neophyte|This subspecies has been cultivated in Britain since 1816. It was first recorded in the wild in 1869 on railway banks at Granton, Edinburgh (Midlothian), where it may have escaped from the Botanic Garden. Trends in its distribution are difficult to assess.|P. flagellaris subsp. flagellaris has a European Boreo-temperate range, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Pilosella officinarum|A stoloniferous, perennial herb of dry habitats, including short grassland, heaths, sand dunes, screes, rock outcrops, quarries and cliffs. It grows on both base-rich and acidic substrates. 0-915 m (Ben Macdui, S. Aberdeen).|Native|There has been no discernible change in the distribution of P. officinarum since the 1962 Atlas. It is variable, and seven subspecies have been recognised. However, all are more or less connected by intermediates, and are not or only partially discrete geographically and ecologically; Stace (1997) considers they are no more than varieties.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Pilosella peleteriana|A perennial herb, spreading by short, thick stolons, occurring on steep, well-drained slopes in chalk and limestone grassland (especially on the edges of paths, on small terraces and at the edge of sea-cliffs), on dry dolerite rock shelves and quarry waste, on shallow soils overlying granite, and on dunes. Lowland.|Native|P. peleteriana was first mapped by Perring & Sell (1968). The current map shows some losses before 1970, but the species is now better recorded in Dorset and the overall distribution is stable. There is no specimen supporting the Merionethshire record mapped in Perring & Sell (1968) and the plant has not been re-found.|Suboceanic Boreo-temperate element.
Pilularia globulifera|A small, rhizomatous fern growing on the edges of non-calcareous lakes, reservoirs, ponds or slow-flowing rivers, and sometimes on damp mine workings or as a submerged aquatic. It requires areas where competition is reduced by fluctuating water levels or disturbance. 0-450 m (Pant-y-llyn Hill, Brecs.).|Native|P. globulifera was lost from many sites before 1930 due to habitat destruction. Eutrophication and reduced disturbance have led to further losses in E. Britain and Ireland. In the west, many new sites have been found since 1980. It has been re-introduced to some former native sites (e.g. Rum).|Suboceanic Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Pimpinella major|A perennial herb, mainly on basic soils derived from chalk and limestone, but also on clay, and most often found on roadsides, hedge banks, railway banks and wood edges, sometimes persisting on roadsides when neighbouring woods have been removed. Generally lowland, reaching 320 m in Derbyshire.|Native|The 1962 Atlas showed a few losses of P. major before 1930, but there is little evidence of any further decline since then; indeed, it is now much better recorded in some areas. Its absence from large areas of S. England is difficult to explain.|European Temperate element. Its scattered, mainly lowland, distribution in our area contrasts with its widespread presence in mountains in mainland Europe.
Pimpinella saxifraga|A perennial herb of grassy habitats on well-drained soils, favouring those which are calcareous or otherwise base-rich, but also on acidic sands. It occurs on grazed and ungrazed chalk and limestone downs, in rough pasture and other grassland, in woodland edges and open rides; less frequently on roadsides and rough ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 810 m on Snowdon (Caerns.) and Dollywagon Pike (Westmorland).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of P. saxifraga since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Pinguicula alpina|A small, rosette-forming, insectivorous perennial herb formerly known from one site, described as a bog or moor. In mainland Europe, it grows in base-rich flushes, stony mires and the drier parts of open boggy heath, often at high altitude. Lowland.|Native|or alien. P. alpina was known from a single site near Avoch (E. Ross), where it was first reported in 1831 and last recorded before 1919. It gradually declined as its site was encroached upon by cultivation and colonised by seedling conifers; it was also heavily collected. Its restriction to this single, otherwise unremarkable, lowland mire has led to suspicions that it may have been planted.|Eurosiberian Arctic-montane element.
Pinguicula grandiflora|A rosette-forming, insectivorous perennial herb, overwintering as a rootless bud which also functions as a vegetative propagule. It is found on wet rocks, flushed moorland and acidic bogs. 0-855 m (Macgillycuddy`s Reeks, S. Kerry).|Native|There has been little change in the native Irish range of P. grandiflora, where this species may be locally abundant. It has been planted in damp places and is occasionally naturalised in Britain.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Pinguicula lusitanica|An insectivorous perennial herb which retains its insect-trapping leaves through the winter. It grows on damp bare peat and at the bases of grass, rush or sedge tussocks beside moorland rills, drainage ditches on former bogs, acidic flushes and wet heaths, often in places trampled by livestock or deer. 0-490 m (Dartmoor, S. Devon, and the Mourne Mountains, Co. Down).|Native|P. lusitanica is an easily overlooked species which has declined in some areas since the 1962 Atlas, largely through loss of habitat, changes in management and scrub encroachment.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Pinguicula vulgaris|A rosette-forming, insectivorous perennial herb of damp, nutrient-poor habitats, overwintering as a rootless bud. It is found in bogs, in crevices of irrigated rocks and rock ledges, in base-poor as well as base-rich open flushes, and in open bryophyte-dominated communities in fens. 0-970 m (Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth).|Native|Many lowland sites of P. vulgaris were lost before the end of the 19th century due to drainage and agricultural intensification. This loss has continued, with over half the 10-km squares which remained in C. & S. England after 1930 now lost, including many in Norfolk. The distribution elsewhere is stable.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © P. Shannon
Pinus contorta|This evergreen tree of plantations is generally grown in more exposed and higher rainfall areas than P. sylvestris, where it will cope with poor, wet soils. It regenerates from seed freely and becomes naturalised in suitable habitats, particularly heathland. The altitudinal range is unknown.|Neophyte|P. contorta was introduced in 1851 and was recorded from the wild by 1968. Foresters have struggled to develop varieties suited to our climate, but the tree is now extensively and increasingly planted in north and west Britain and Ireland. In many such areas it is currently the only economic alternative to Picea sitchensis.|Native of western N. America; widely planted in N. Europe.
Pinus nigra|P. nigra is found in plantations, shelter-belts, parks, churchyards and large gardens, locally becoming naturalised on heaths and sand dunes. Subsp. nigra prefers light soils; subsp. laricio tolerates a wider range of soils. Regeneration from seed is frequent. Lowland.|Neophyte|Subsp. laricio was introduced in 1814, subsp. nigra in 1835; the former was known in the wild by 1905 and the latter by 1951. P. nigra is preferred to P. sylvestris for forestry in S. Britain, where it has become widespread on heaths.|The species is a native of S. Europe, N. Africa and S.W. Asia. Subsp. nigra occurs in Austria, Italy and the Balkans and subsp. laricio in Corsica, S. Italy and Sicily.
Pinus sylvestris|P. sylvestris occurs as a native in pure stands or with other trees in mixed woodland. It prefers sandy and stony, acidic soils, though will also grow on waterlogged peats. It is widely planted in woods and shelter-belts, often becoming naturalised on heaths and bogs. 0-675 m as a native (Beinn a` Bhuird, S. Aberdeen).|Native|The native range is defined by the Caledonian Pinewood Inventory (Forestry Authority Scotland, 1998). Much effort has been directed at conserving native populations and controlling introduced populations on heathland. It is out of favour as a forestry tree, except in N.E. Britain.|Eurasian Boreal-montane element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Pisum sativum|A climbing or sprawling annual, found as a casual on field margins, on tips and in waste places. Lowland.|Casual|P. sativum was a very early crop in the Middle East, dating from c. 7000 bc. It is not known when it reached Britain, but it was certainly present two thousand years ago and has been cultivated in British gardens since at least 1200 (Harvey, 1981). Commercial scale cropping is now widespread, as well as cultivation as a domestic vegetable, and it has been recorded in the wild since at least 1888.|Apparently native in the Mediterranean region and S.W. Asia, but its native range is obscured by its spread in cultivation.
Plantago coronopus|A perennial herb of dry, open, often heavily trampled, habitats on acidic to basic stony or sandy soils, and rock crevices. It occurs in open grassland, on heaths, sand dunes and shingle, sea-cliffs and sea-walls, waste ground and by paths. Always known inland in S. and E. England, plants increasingly occur beside salt-treated roads. 0-340 m (Chagford, S. Devon).|Native|Unlike many halophytes, there has been no major change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, although many sites in the Midlands have been lost since 1950 as heathland has been improved.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Plantago lanceolata|A perennial herb, found in a wide range of habitats over all but the most acidic soils. It occurs in meadows and pastures, in upland grasslands, on rock ledges and crevices, sand dunes and cliffs (including sites subject to sea-spray), on roadsides and river banks, in cultivated and waste ground, in lawns and on walls. Seed is moderately long-lived. 0-790 m in Atholl (E. Perth), and 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas. It is genetically and phenotypically variable.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Plantago major|A perennial herb of open habitats; it is most frequent on trampled paths and tracks, disturbed field edges and roadsides, and in gardens, but it also occurs in some closed grasslands. It grows in a wide range of soils, avoiding only very acidic sites, and can produce a large and persistent seed bank. 0-625 m (Knock Fell), with an exceptional record at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (both Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of this ubiquitous species is stable. Subsp. major occurs throughout the range of the species, subsp. intermedia is mapped separately.|Eurasian Wide-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-temperate.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Plantago maritima|A perennial herb of the middle and upper zones of saltmarshes, coastal turf, rocks and cliffs, on coastal heaths and occasionally on shingle beaches and inland saltmarshes. In the uplands it is found in species-rich pastures, on stream banks, rock ledges and scree, and in stony flushes. It occasionally colonises inland road verges. 0-790 m (Caerns., Mid Perth and Co. Mayo).|Native|The distribution of P. maritima in semi-natural habitats shows little change since the 1962 Atlas. It has spread on the verges of salt-treated roads, especially in Scotland, but this is barely evident at the 10-km scale.|Eurosiberian Wide-boreal element; also in N. America.     © L. Rooney
Plantago media|A perennial herb, characteristic of chalk and limestone soils but also occurring on heavy clay soils. The main habitats are downland grassland and tracks, calcareous pasture and mown grassland (such as churchyards); it is less frequent in hay meadows and on fixed dunes, and is sometimes found in water-meadows which receive calcareous water (Grose, 1957). Seed appears to be short-lived. 0-520 m (S. Northumb.).|Native|P. media shows declines since the 1962 Atlas around the limits of its core area, mainly due to improvements to permanent pastures.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P.

Platanthera bifolia||||
Platanthera chlorantha|This perennial herb is found in a wide variety of habitats, usually on well-drained calcareous soils. Typical habitats include downland, rough pasture, hay meadows, scrub, woodland and young plantations. It sometimes occurs on sand dunes and railway embankments. Rarely, it grows on slightly acidic soils in moorland and wet, heathy pasture. 0-460 m (Harwood Dale, S. Northumb.).|Native|P. chlorantha was lost from many sites during the 20th century. Reasons include the felling, disturbance and coniferisation of woodland, and the agricultural improvement of pasture and scrub. It may be lost from woodland if the canopy becomes too dense.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Poa alpina|A perennial herb of damp mountain rock faces, open ledges and rocky slopes on calcareous substrates, often with P. glauca. Most populations are wholly or partially proliferous. From 580 m at High Cup Nick (Westmorland) to 1190 m on Aonach Beag (Westerness).|Native|P. alpina has gone from some sites, with several outlying populations having suffered from injudicious collecting. However, some of its remotest stations are seldom visited by botanists, and it is probably present in many squares for which only pre-1987 records are available.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © Pete Stroh
Poa angustifolia|A rhizomatous perennial herb of dry grassland, wall-tops, rough ground and railway embankments, typically on relatively infertile chalky, sandy or gravelly soils. In parts of S. England it often occurs in partial shade under Fagus trees. Lowland.|Native|Historically, P. angustifolia has been confused with other members of the Poa pratensis group. Its distribution was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968) and investigated by Sargent et al. (1986). It is probably decreasing in semi-natural habitats, but trends are difficult to assess given the lack of historical data. The map, apart from the under-recording in Sussex and Wiltshire, is probably a reasonable reflection of its distribution.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element.
Poa annua|An annual growing in a wide range of disturbed and man-made habitats, including overgrazed and trampled grasslands, lawns, arable fields, waste ground, paths, waysides and wall-tops. Perennial variants occur in montane and coastal grassland. P. annua is also a common wool and bird-seed alien, and a familiar garden weed throughout the British Isles. 0-1210 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|P. annua is ubiquitous, and its range has not changed since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Wide-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-temperate.     © P. Stanley, IWNHAS
Poa bulbosa|A tufted bulbous-based perennial herb of open grassland and barish sandy or rocky places near the sea; mainly on sand dunes and stabilised shingle, but also on bare chalk and limestone. Some populations are wholly or partially proliferous. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of P. bulbosa is probably stable; there are few losses and most of the newly recorded populations are probably long-established. The origins of the inland colonies are uncertain: they could be previously overlooked native populations, recent arrivals as a result of a natural extension of range, or introductions with sand and ballast.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L.

Poa chaixii|A stout, densely tufted perennial herb naturalised in copses and open woodland. It is occasionally found growing with Festuca heterophylla, another ornamental species admired by Victorian gardeners. Generally lowland, but reaching 395 m (The Quiraing, N. Ebudes).|Neophyte|P. chaixii has been grown in gardens for ornament or ground cover since 1802, and was much planted in the 19th century in the grounds of large estates, especially in Scotland. It was recorded in the wild by 1852. There has been little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas, but it is possibly under-recorded.|Native of montane woods in C. & S. Europe; widely naturalised further north.
Poa compressa|A rhizomatous perennial herb of rough or stony ground, cinders, dry grassy banks, waysides and walls. Some populations on rubbish tips and waste ground are probably introductions from wool shoddy and other sources. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m at Mallerstang (Westmorland).|Native|There is no reliable information on trends in the distribution of P. compressa, and it is not possible to make a clear distinction between native and introduced populations, particularly in Scotland. It is regarded as alien in Ireland (Scannell & Synnott, 1987). The species is sometimes confused with other Poa species, particularly P. humilis, and is probably under-recorded.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Poa flexuosa|A tufted perennial herb of acidic rock ledges, screes and stony mountain plateaux. From 760 m to 1100 m (Ben Nevis, Westerness).|Native|P. flexuosa is now known from more 10-km squares than were mapped in the 1962 Atlas. Since 1970 it has been recorded from about a dozen sites, most of these supporting only very small populations. P. x jemtlandica (P. flexuosa x P. alpina) occurs with P. flexuosa at some sites, and may perhaps have given rise to some mis-identifications.|European Arctic-montane element; also in N. America.
Poa glauca|A tufted perennial herb of damp mountain rock faces, open ledges, screes and rocky slopes on calcareous substrates, often with Poa alpina. It is also known as a casual by a disused railway in Cardiganshire. From 305 m on Trotternish, Skye (N. Ebudes) to 1110 m on Lochnagar (S. Aberdeen).|Native|P. glauca appears to have declined since the 1962 Atlas, though it may be present in many sites in remote mountain areas for which there are only pre-1987 records. It is thought to be sensitive to grazing, which might explain its decline in some areas.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Poa humilis|A rhizomatous perennial herb found in a wide array of grassland habitats, including neutral meadows, calcareous grassland, sand dunes, roadsides, wall-tops, river-banks and mountain slopes. Morphologically and cytologically this is a highly variable species; some of its variants may be apomictic, and its ecology is poorly understood. 0-670 m (Knock Fell, Westmorland) and probably higher elsewhere.|Native|In the 1962 Atlas, P. humilis was not distinguished from other taxa within the P. pratensis group, but it was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968). It is still ignored by some recorders. The paucity of reliable historical data makes distributional trends difficult to assess.|World distribution uncertain.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Poa infirma|An annual growing near the sea in open, trampled grassland, on cliff-top paths, tracksides, picnic sites, lawns and car parks, and in stabilised dunes and other sandy places. Lowland.|Native|At the time of the 1962 Atlas, P. infirma was thought to be restricted to W. Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and the Channel Islands. However, there has been a very considerable extension of range eastwards in the last 10-15 years (Takagi-Arigho, 1994). This can probably be attributed to better recording, as botanists are now more familiar with this species, which is only apparent in early spring and closely resembles P. annua. In Ireland, it was found in a garden in 1987 (Co. Londonderry) and in the wild in W. Cork in 2000.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Poa nemoralis|A tufted perennial herb of woodland rides and glades, hedgerows and other shaded places; also locally on walls, and in the mountains on dry rock ledges. It was occasionally sown in woodlands and parks for its ornamental value, while in some areas it may have been introduced with wool shoddy, grass-seed or soil. Generally lowland, but reaching 915 m (Sgurr na Lappaich, Glen Farrar, Easterness).|Native|The native distribution of P. nemoralis is impossible to delimit with any degree of certainty. It was mapped as `all records` for the 1962 Atlas, and may be spreading in parts of N.W. Britain and Ireland, where it was probably originally introduced.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Poa palustris|A short-lived tufted perennial growing in marshes, fens, ditches, Salix carr and at the edges of rivers, canals, lakes and ponds; occasionally around docks, by railways and on waste ground. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Neophyte|P. palustris is thought to have been introduced in the 19th century as a fodder grass, and was recorded from the wild in 1879. The map suggests a substantial decline in the last forty years, though at many old localities its occurrence was probably only transient. It is easily overlooked.|A Circumpolar Boreo-temperate species, but absent as a native from much of W. Europe.
Poa pratensis sens.lat.|These rhizomatous perennial herbs are found in a wide range of habitats, from wet to dry, infertile to fertile, somewhat acidic to strongly calcareous. They grow in grasslands, on sand dunes, river banks, mountain slopes, roadsides, waste ground and wall-tops. 0?1065 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|There is no evidence of any change in the range of P. pratensis sens. lat. since the 1962 Atlas. The aggregate includes three species (P. pratensis sens. str., P. humilis and P. angustifolia), all of which are mapped separately.|The three species in our area have a Circumpolar Wide-temperate distribution; the fourth European species, P. alpigena, extends the range to the high Arctic.
Poa pratensis sens.str.|A rhizomatous perennial herb of meadows, pastures, waysides and waste places; formerly an important constituent of commercial seed mixtures, and still used in the sowing of amenity and wild-flower grasslands. It is a versatile grass, preferring well-drained, neutral soils of moderate to high fertility, and tolerant of grazing and trampling. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Native|There are no reliable historical data to allow an assessment of whether the distribution of this taxon is changing. However, the P. pratensis aggregate appears to have a stable distribution in many lowland areas where this is the most common segregate. It is unevenly recorded.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Poa trivialis|A stoloniferous perennial herb of open woodland, meadows, pastures, walls, waste ground, waysides and cultivated land; it also grows in marshes and beside ponds, ditches and streams. It was formerly included in commercial grass-seed mixtures, and is still used in amenity and wild-flower grasslands. It is a common wool alien. Generally lowland, but reaching 1065 m on Carn Eige, Glen Affric (Easterness).|Native|There has been no change in the range of P. trivialis since the 1962 Atlas. It is very widespread, being absent only from montane areas.|Eurosiberian Wide-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-temperate.
Polemonium caeruleum|A clump-forming perennial herb, largely restricted as a native to steep but stabilised limestone screes, usually in partial shade, but also found on andesite debris and river-cliffs in Northumberland. It is confined to sites where the soil remains moist. Alien populations occur along hedgerows, on river banks and in other places near habitation. 200-580 m (Pen-y-ghent, Mid-W. Yorks.) as native, but down to sea level as an alien.|Native|The native range seems generally stable. P. caeruleum is popular in gardens, but confusion of garden and native forms is unlikely (Pigott, 1958).|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Polycarpon tetraphyllum|A summer- or occasionally winter-annual found in open, sunny sites that are droughted in summer and relatively frost-free in winter. It grows with other therophytes on steep S.-facing banks, on compacted shingle or sand, in bulb-fields and gardens and at the base of roadside walls. Lowland.|Native|P. tetraphyllum has been known in Dorset since 1770 and S. Devon since 1778. Populations can fluctuate dramatically in numbers, and it has been rediscovered at some sites after an apparent absence of many years. Comparison with the 1962 Atlas shows little change at the 10-km scale.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Polygala amarella|A perennial herb of base-rich substrates. On the North Downs it is usually found in close-grazed chalk grassland, and in N. England in limestone grassland, on rock ledges and in fissures in limestone scars, and sometimes on damp stream banks and in areas of eroded sugar limestone. Generally lowland, but reaching 530 m on Cronkley Fell (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|The overall range of this species has changed little, although it has disappeared from some sites and greatly declined in others, particularly in Kent, during the last few decades. This is probably caused by changes in grazing regimes.|European Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Polygala calcarea|A perennial herb found in tightly-grazed chalk and limestone grassland, usually on warm S.-facing slopes. It is a poor competitor which disappears if insufficient grazing allows coarser grasses to become dominant. Lowland.|Native|P. calcarea remains locally frequent within its main area of distribution but seems to have been lost from some localities towards the periphery of its range, possibly due to a lack of grazing.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Polygala serpyllifolia|A perennial herb occurring on acidic soils in grasslands, moors, heaths and mires. 0-1035 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There has been a substantial decline in S. England, and analysis of the database reveals that these declines have occurred since 1950.|Suboceanic Temperate element; also in Greenland.     © Shannon, P
Polygala vulgaris|A perennial herb which usually grows in short, moderately infertile neutral to basic grassland on banks, hill-slopes crags and sand dunes. It also occurs in acid grasslands, heaths and fen-meadows. 0-730 m (Mourne Mountains, Co. Down).|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There has been no significant change in the overall range of this species, but there have been very substantial losses within its range. Analysis of the database reveals that most of these occurred since 1950. Declines are presumably due to the intensification of grassland management and conversion to arable.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Polygonatum multiflorum|A rhizomatous perennial herb, native in Fraxinus-Acer campestre woods and thickets over chalk and limestone, and less frequently over non-acidic substrates. Lowland.|Native|P. multiflorum and P. x hybridum were not distinguished in the 1962 Atlas, so changes in their distribution are difficult to assess. P. multiflorum is often planted and its native range is difficult to define with certainty. Alien populations are certainly over-recorded for the hybrid P. x hybridum.|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia.
Polygonatum odoratum|A rhizomatous, perennial herb of ancient Fraxinus woods, often growing in crevices and on outcrops of limestone. In N. England it is characteristic of grikes in limestone pavement. Generally lowland, but reaching 485 m on Craig y Cilau (Brecs.).|Native|Some populations of P. odoratum have been lost since the 1962 Atlas through the destruction of limestone pavement in the north of its range, but this threat is now much reduced and the distribution has probably stabilised. It is sometimes grown in gardens, and is occasionally naturalised when discarded or deliberately planted.|Eurasian Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Polygonatum verticillatum|A rhizomatous, perennial herb usually found on moist, nutrient-rich, usually basic, soils in wooded gorges and on a wooded river bank. Plants reproduce vegetatively, by rhizomatous spread, but fruiting is generally poor, with recruitment from seed apparently very infrequent. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of P. verticillatum is stable, though some populations have been lost through erosion and habitat destruction. Flowering seems to be restricted by excessive shading at a number of localities and limited opportunities for cross-pollination further restrict seed production.|European Boreal-montane element.
Polygonum arenastrum|A prostrate annual of open and trampled ground, especially of well-drained soils, on tracks, paths, roadsides and weedy pavements, around ponds and field gateways. 0-450 m (near Birkdale, Westmorland).|Archaeophyte|P. arenastrum is widespread throughout Britain and Ireland, although often overlooked as P. aviculare. It has not been mapped previously on a national scale, having been included within P. aviculare agg. in the 1962 Atlas. Its distribution is not likely to have changed appreciably.|As an archaeophyte, P. arenastrum has a Eurasian Wide-temperate distribution; in recent centuries it has become widely naturalised outside this range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Polygonum aviculare|An annual of open and disturbed ground, including arable land, gardens, waste places and seashores. The species remains a significant agricultural weed. 0-550 m (Northumberland), with an exceptional record at 670 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|P. aviculare was mapped with other members of the aggregate in the 1962 Atlas, but it is most unlikely that there have been any changes in distribution. It is under-recorded in areas where the segregates of P. aviculare have not been distinguished. Almost all records from Shetland are now referred to P. boreale.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Polygonum aviculare agg.|These annuals of open, usually fertile, disturbed soils are commonly found in gardens, on arable land, tracks, paths, pavements, roadsides, waste ground, damp pond margins and on seashores. 0?670 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|This aggregate includes the native P. aviculare sens. str. and P. boreale and the archaeophytes P. arenastrum and P. rurivagum; all four are mapped separately. A fifth species, P. neglectum, may be overlooked in Britain. In Norden, all these taxa are treated as subspecies (Jonsell, 2000).|A complex of closely related taxa which together have a Circumpolar Wide-temperate distribution.
Polygonum boreale|An annual of open and disturbed ground on roadsides and paths, cultivated land, sandy beaches, dunes and coastal shingle. In Orkney and Shetland it replaces P. aviculare and P. arenastrum, although it was formerly overlooked elsewhere due to confusion with these species. Lowland.|Native|P. boreale was not mapped separately in the 1962 Atlas, being included within P. aviculare agg., but was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968). Subsequent records have extended the known range along the N. coast of Scotland and in the Hebrides, with scattered, perhaps adventive, localities further south. It is likely still to be under-recorded.|Suboceanic Boreal-montane element; also in N. America.
Polygonum maritimum|A prostrate perennial herb of sand, shingle or shell beaches, growing above the limit of the highest tides with other strand-line and foredune plants. Lowland.|Native|The 1962 Atlas recorded this species from just four post-1930 sites in S.W. England (W. Cornwall, N. Devon and the Channel Islands). Records during the 1990s have considerably extended the known range. Its recent spread in England correlates with a run of mild winters and hot summers. In Ireland it persists at the site where it was discovered in 1973.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Polygonum oxyspermum|A prostrate annual, biennial or short-lived perennial of sand, shingle or shell beaches, sometimes found on other open sandy ground near the sea, usually just above the limit of the highest tides. Lowland.|Native|There are now many more records for this species than in the 1962 Atlas, not only in N. England and Scotland, where it was patently under-recorded, but also Cornwall, Hampshire and Wales. Like other strand-line species, its numbers often fluctuate annually. Most populations are subsp. raii. Subsp. oxyspermum has been reported as a casual in Scotland, perhaps having arrived naturally from the Baltic region.|European Wide-temperate element; also in N. America.     © L. Rooney
Polygonum rurivagum|An annual of arable fields and more rarely of ruderal habitats, especially on light chalky soils and calcareous clays. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|The species was first mapped on a national scale by Perring & Sell (1968). Records since then have considerably extended the known range, and it may also be spreading with translocated topsoil. It is probably still under-recorded, as it is easily overlooked as P. aviculare.|As an archaeophyte P. rurivagum has a European Temperate distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Polypodium cambricum|A perennial, rhizomatous fern of well-drained base-rich rocky substrates, often found on sheltered limestone cliffs, old quarry faces, castle walls built of limestone, and on old mortared walls. It is also found as an epiphyte, especially in Ireland, and on road banks. 0-460 m (Farreg-y-fran, Merioneth, and Malham Tarn, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|Many sites for P. cambricum have been found since it was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968). Some populations have been lost to scrub encroachment and masonry cleaning.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; it reaches its northern limit at Lismore (Main Argyll).
Polypodium interjectum|An evergreen, perennial, rhizomatous fern that prefers more basic substrates than P. vulgare but can be found in acidic conditions where exposed to salt-laden air. It is found in a wide range of habitats such as mortared stone walls, hedge banks, rock exposures, mature sand dunes and as an epiphyte, especially near the sea. 0?820 m (Creag Meagaidh, Westerness).|Native|The increased number of records of this species since it was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968) and Jermy et al. (1978) is due to better recording and not to any real increase in its distribution. It is probably still under-recorded.|Suboceanic Temperate element.
Polypodium vulgare|An evergreen, perennial, rhizomatous fern of well-drained, predominantly acidic substrates, including dry-stone walls, roadside banks and rock outcrops. It also occurs as an epiphyte on Quercus and other deciduous trees, mainly in W. Britain and Ireland, and is also found in conifer plantations. It is very tolerant of exposure, growing, for example, on montane scree. 0?760 m (Beinn na Socaich, Westerness).|Native|There is little evidence for any change in the distribution of P. vulgare sens. str. It is probably under-recorded in Ireland and in some areas of Scotland but is rarer than P. interjectum in S.E. England.|European Boreo-temperate element.
Polypodium vulgare sens.lat.|These perennial rhizomatous ferns are found on a wide variety of natural and artificial rocky substrates. They also grow as epiphytes, especially in W. Britain and Ireland. 0?850 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth, and Mt Brandon, S. Kerry), possibly higher in W. Ross.|Native|The P. vulgare aggregate mapped here consists of diploid P. cambricum, tetraploid P. vulgare and hexaploid P. interjectum, and their hybrids. Although the segregates were described by Shivas (1960) and mapped by Perring & Sell (1968) and Jermy et al. (1978), they require microscopic examination for certain identification and are still under-recorded.|The aggregate has a Circumpolar Boreo-temperate distribution.
Polypogon monspeliensis|An annual of barish places by the sea, in damp, cattle-trodden grazing marshes, at the edges of dried-up brackish pools and ditches, and in the uppermost parts of saltmarshes. Also around docks and inland as a casual from wool, bird-seed and other sources. Lowland.|Native|The native distribution of P. monspeliensis is broadly similar to that mapped in the 1962 Atlas, and it occurs with similar frequency as a casual. However, several local floras (e.g. Brewis et al., 1996) report that pond and ditch infilling, and the drainage and conversion of coastal marshes to arable, are causing declines in native populations. It may be becoming established inland.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Polystichum aculeatum|This evergreen species is characteristic of mountain gorges and steep wooded river valleys where it grows in thin but damp, mildly acidic to base-rich soils between rocks and in crevices. It also grows in the grikes of limestone pavement, on shady mortared walls, on hedge-banks, and around cave entrances and mine shafts. It is rarely plentiful in S. England, usually occurring as scattered individuals and only becoming common in the north of its range. 0?760 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|There is little change in the distribution of this species, other than in S.E. England where it appears to have decreased since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Temperate element.     © M. Bower, IWNHAS
Polystichum lonchitis|This evergreen species is a calcicole, growing in well-drained, cool and moist positions at the base of cliffs, on rocky ledges, and particularly in stabilised boulder-scree. It also grows in deep grikes of limestone pavements. P. lonchitis is a poor competitor, but is long-lived once established. From 180 m at Inchnadamph, W. Sutherland, but generally above 600 m and reaching 1150 m in the Breadalbanes (Mid Perth).|Native|Although some sites were lost to collecting before 1930, there has been little evidence of a change in the distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Polystichum setiferum|This semi-evergreen fern is a moderate calcicole, occurring in shaded deciduous woodland, hedgerows, lane banks and sheltered streamsides, and also in the peaty bottoms of grikes in limestone pavement. It grows on a wide range of soil types, from those derived from sands to clays, but prefers sloping or well-drained ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 305 m on Walla Crag (Cumberland).|Native|There are many more records for this species than in the 1962 Atlas; these can be attributed to more efficient recording and there is little evidence for a change in its distribution.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Populus alba|A broad-crowned tree which is most frequent as a female in amenity plantings along roadsides and in parks; also in windbreaks and on coastal dunes, but rarely in plantations. It suckers freely and sometimes becomes well-established, forming dense thickets. It is resistant to salt-laden winds. Lowland.|Neophyte|There is no certain evidence for the presence of P. alba in Britain before 1500. It is usually said to have been brought from Holland in the 16th century, and was certainly recorded from the wild by 1597. It is now much planted, sometimes as distinct cultivars.|Native of S., C. & E. Europe, eastwards to C. Asia; widely naturalised north and west of its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Populus alba x tremula (P. x canescens)|This broad-crowned tree often grows as a solitary, usually male, specimen or among native trees and shrubs. It is planted in windbreaks and as an amenity tree, especially in damp woods and by streams. Lowland.|Neophyte|P. x canescens was perhaps imported to our area as a hybrid, and was formerly planted for timber. The first certain record was made c. 1700. It is now much planted, but rarely becomes naturalised and probably rarely arises anew from the parents. It has increased in Scotland and N. Ireland since the 1962 Atlas, but seems stable elsewhere.|A hybrid which occurs naturally within the native range of P. alba, and has been spread beyond by planting.
Populus nigra sens.lat.||||
Populus tremula|A broad-crowned tree of moist clay or sandy soils in mixed broad-leaved woodlands, hedgerows, on heathland, in disused clay- and sand-pits, and occasionally in pine woods. In the north and west, it grows on cliffs, rocky outcrops and riverbanks, often as a shrub. It suckers to form thickets, and readily colonises bare ground. 0-640 m (Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|Like many trees, P. tremula may have been under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas. It has been planted for amenity and as food for browsing deer.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Potamogeton acutifolius|This rhizomatous perennial has a very narrow habitat range, being confined to shallow, species-rich drainage ditches in lowland grazing marshes, where it typically grows in calcareous, mesotrophic or meso-eutrophic water. Although it fruits relatively freely and also produces turions, it shows little or no propensity to colonise new habitats. Lowland.|Native|P. acutifolius appears to be in gradual, long-term decline. Since 1960 it has decreased in Norfolk and become extinct in the London area and critically endangered in Dorset. However, several vigorous populations survive in Sussex.|European Temperate element.
Potamogeton alpinus|A rhizomatous perennial of still or slow-flowing water in lakes, rivers, canals, ditches and flooded mineral workings. P. alpinus is often found in sites where silt accumulates, such as lake inflows or backwaters in rivers. It characteristically grows in mesotrophic, often neutral or mildly acidic water. 0-945 m (Meall nan Tarmachan, Mid Perth).|Native|Many of the sites from which P. alpinus has been lost in England are small ponds, pits and ditches where it was last seen in the 19th century. There have been some further losses in England and S.E. Scotland from eutrophication, but the distribution elsewhere appears to be stable.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Potamogeton berchtoldii|A variable species which occurs in a wide range of still or slowly flowing waters, which may be base-rich or base-poor, oligotrophic, mesotrophic or eutrophic, and exposed or sheltered. P. berchtoldii is sometimes found in brackish sites, but is usually replaced in such habitats by P. pusillus. 0-710 m (Lochan nan Cat, Mid Perth).|Native|Until 1938, P. berchtoldii was confused with P. pusillus in our area. It is under-recorded by botanists who neglect linear-leaved pondweeds but may be over-recorded by others who fail to distinguish P. pusillus. Changes in its distribution are difficult to assess.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Potamogeton coloratus|This rhizomatous perennial herb is found in shallow, calcium-rich but nutrient-poor waters in lakes, pools, clay-pits, shallow streams and ditches. It grows over a range of substrates, including peat, marl, sand and clay. Lowland.|Native|P. coloratus has declined over much of its British range, having been lost from many sites because of drainage or eutrophication. Many remaining localities are in nature reserves. It has, however, also colonised some new habitats since 1930, and the largest populations are currently those in abandoned brickfields in Peterborough. In Ireland it is still relatively frequent in the central plain.|European Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Potamogeton compressus|P. compressus, a rhizomatous perennial, has been recorded from a wide range of habitats: lakes, sluggish rivers, ditches, canals and flooded mineral workings. Its sites share a tendency to be still or slowly flowing, mesotrophic and slightly to moderately base-rich. Lowland.|Native|This species appears to have been in gradual decline for over a hundred and fifty years. It is almost extinct in lakes and rivers, and is declining in grazing marsh ditches. In Broadland populations have been lost since 1970. Some of the most vigorous surviving populations are in canals, especially the Montgomery branch of the Shropshire Union Canal.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.
Potamogeton crispus|P. crispus is a rhizomatous perennial which grows in a wide range of mesotrophic or eutrophic waters. These include lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, canals, ditches and disused mineral workings. It is more tolerant of eutrophication than most British Potamogeton species. Generally lowland, but reaching 350 m at Drumore Loch (E. Perth).|Native|This is one of the most distinctive Potamogeton species, and it is therefore relatively well recorded. There is little evidence for any change in its British or Irish distribution.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.
Potamogeton epihydrus|In the Outer Hebrides, this rhizomatous perennial grows in a few peaty lochans, in oligotrophic and base-poor water less than 1 m deep. It is also established in the mesotrophic Rochdale Canal and Calder & Hebble Navigation in N. England. Lowland.|Native|This species was first discovered in England near Halifax (S.W. Yorks.) in 1907; although it must be an introduction there, the manner of its arrival from N. America is unclear. It was not found in the Outer Hebrides, where it is native, until 1943, and there is no evidence for any subsequent change in its distribution there.|Oceanic Boreo-temperate element; in Europe restricted to Britain but widespread in N. America.
Potamogeton filiformis|This rhizomatous herb usually grows in open vegetation in the shallow edges of lakes. It is typically found over gravel, sand, silt or mud in sites where the water is base-rich, eutrophic or slightly brackish. It also occasionally grows in rivers, streams and ditches. 0-390 m at Drumore Loch (E. Perth), formerly at 735 m at Coire Dhubh-chlair (Mid Perth).|Native|P. filiformis was last collected in Anglesey in 1826, and it may have decreased in E. Scotland since 1960, as it can no longer be found at some sites. However, there is little evidence for any decline in N. Scotland or Ireland, where it may be under-recorded.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Potamogeton friesii|A rhizomatous perennial of calcareous and often rather eutrophic, still or very slowly flowing waters. These include lakes, sluggish rivers and streams, canals, fenland lodes and flooded mineral workings. Lowland.|Native|P. friesii expanded through the canal network, and subsequently declined as canals became disused or dominated by pleasure boat traffic. Like other linear-leaved pondweeds it is probably under-recorded. The distinction between P. friesii and P. pusillus is straightforward in England but becomes difficult in N. Scotland and some records may require reassessment.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Potamogeton gramineus|This variable perennial is found in relatively shallow water in a variety of water bodies, including lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, canals and ditches. It tolerates a wide range of water quality, although it is absent both from the most acidic and oligotrophic sites and from the most eutrophic. It survives occasional, short-term desiccation. 0?915 m (Meall nan Tarmachan, Mid Perth).|Native|Like many aquatics, P. gramineus is better recorded than it was in the 1962 Atlas. However, it has declined in England since 1930 in areas where eutrophication and the conversion of grazing land to arable have reduced the number of suitable ditches.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Potamogeton gramineus x lucens (P. x zizii)|This rhizomatous perennial grows in a range of mesotrophic, somewhat base-enriched waters including lakes, rivers, streams, fenland lodes and ditches. In N. Scotland and N.W. Ireland it often occurs in the absence of P. lucens. It is morphologically variable and some populations are sterile whereas others set well-formed fruit. 0?395 m (Loch na Craige, Mid Perth).|Native|There is little evidence for the decline of this hybrid in N.W. Ireland and W. Scotland, where it is probably still under-recorded. In E. Ireland, E. Scotland and England there is a clear decline, which matches that of P. lucens in Scotland and P. gramineus in England.|Widespread in temperate Europe.
Potamogeton gramineus x perfoliatus (P. x nitens)|This rhizomatous perennial is found in more or less mesotrophic water in lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, canals and ditches. In some sites it can be the most abundant macrophyte, sometimes occurring in the absence of one or even both parents. It is favoured by moderate fluctuations in water level, and can withstand short periods of desiccation. 0?640 m (Loch Oss, W. Perth).|Native|P. x nitens is a sterile hybrid which sometimes resembles P. gramineus very closely, and is almost certainly under-recorded. It has been lost from some sites in East Anglia, and was last recorded from the Basingstoke Canal (N. Hants.) in 1931.|Widespread in boreal and temperate regions of Europe and also recorded elsewhere in the N. hemisphere.
Potamogeton lucens|A rhizomatous perennial herb with submerged but no floating leaves, P. lucens grows in relatively deep, calcareous water in lakes, larger rivers, canals, flooded chalk- and gravel-pits and major fenland drains. It is found in clear, nutrient-poor, unpolluted waters as well as more eutrophic and turbid sites. 0?380 m (Malham Tarn, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|P. lucens remains frequent in some areas of England and Ireland, although there is evidence for decline in Surrey since 1930 and at the northern edge of its English range. It has declined more markedly in E. Scotland, apparently being more susceptible to eutrophication there.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Potamogeton natans|This rhizomatous perennial herb is frequent as a floating-leaved aquatic in still or slowly flowing waters, and more rarely found as plants with submerged phyllodes in more rapid streams and rivers. It has a very wide ecological tolerance, growing in oligotrophic to eutrophic and base-poor to base-rich water over a wide range of substrates. Although it may be found in shallow swamps, or in water over 5 m deep, it is most frequent at moderate depths of 1-2 metres. 0-760 m (below Stob Ban, Westerness).|Native|There is little evidence for any change in the distribution of P. natans since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Potamogeton nodosus|This rhizomatous perennial herb is confined to a few calcareous and moderately eutrophic rivers. It grows in shallow or fairly deep water, apparently preferring gravelly substrates and avoiding soft clays. It reproduces vegetatively but does not fruit in Britain. Lowland.|Native|P. nodosus has a relatively stable distribution in the Bristol Avon, the Dorset Stour and the R. Loddon (Berks.). It is apparently extinct in the Thames, perhaps eliminated in the 1950s by eutrophication and increasing pleasure-boat traffic. The record from the Warwickshire Stour is based on a single, 19th century specimen. Recently, it has been planted at additional sites.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element.
Potamogeton obtusifolius|A rhizomatous perennial characteristically found in mesotrophic or meso-eutrophic, acidic or neutral standing waters in lakes, ponds and flooded mineral workings, or in canals and the backwaters of rivers. It may, however, occupy a broader habitat range in areas such as N. Ireland where it is especially frequent. It fruits freely, and also reproduces by turions. 0-480 m (Angle Tarn, Patterdale, Westmorland).|Native|Although P. obtusifolius is better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas, the map suggests that it has declined throughout much of its British range. There is less evidence of decline in Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Potamogeton pectinatus|This rhizomatous, linear-leaved aquatic is a characteristic species of eutrophic or brackish waters, where it may form dense stands in lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, canals, ditches, ponds and flooded mineral workings. It is tolerant of disturbance in canals and navigable rivers. It is occasionally found in highly calcareous but nutrient-poor lakes. Lowland.|Native|There is little evidence for any change in the distribution of this species. Any losses from habitat destruction have been compensated for by the ability of the species to colonise newly available habitats, such as flooded sand- and gravel-pits.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element.
Potamogeton perfoliatus|A frequent macrophyte in larger water bodies, P. perfoliatus occasionally grows in oligotrophic sites but is more often found in mesotrophic or eutrophic conditions. It is a rhizomatous perennial that grows in shallow water in sites which are not prone to occasional desiccation, but is most vigorous at depths of 1 m or more. 0-780 m (Loch an Tairbh-uisge, Mid Perth).|Native|There is evidence for a decline of P. perfoliatus in some areas, such as Surrey and Cheshire. However it remains frequent in many regions, including some where more exacting Potamogeton species have declined.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Potamogeton polygonifolius|This rhizomatous perennial herb may grow as an aquatic in shallow water in lakes, pools, the backwaters of rivers, streams and ditches, or in a dwarf, subterrestrial state in wet Sphagnum lawns or `brown moss` communities. It is usually restricted to acidic water, only rarely occurring in highly calcareous but nutrient-poor sites. 0-780 m (Lochan an Tairbh-uisge, Mid Perth).|Native|This species has declined in parts of S.E. England where suitable habitats have always been rare, and have been gradually reduced by habitat destruction, drainage or falling water-tables.|Suboceanic Temperate element; also in N. America.
Potamogeton praelongus|No Potamogeton species is more characteristic of deep water than P. praelongus. It is a rhizomatous perennial that usually grows at depths greater than 1 m in clear, mesotrophic water in lakes, rivers, canals and major drains. It has only rarely been recorded from shallow water. 0-800 m (Loch Coire Cheap, Mid Perth).|Native|P. praelongus appears to have been lost from many waters in the southern half of its range since 1930. The most likely cause of this decline is eutrophication. As a species of deeper water it can be inconspicuous, and it may be under-recorded in Scotland and Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Potamogeton pusillus|A rhizomatous perennial found in standing or slowly flowing water in sheltered lakes and reservoirs, ponds, rivers, canals, ditches and flooded mineral workings. It favours mesotrophic to eutrophic water and tolerates slightly brackish conditions. 0-320 m (Stony Middleton, Derbys.).|Native|P. pusillus and P. berchtoldii were confused in our area until 1938. Any assessment of changes in their distribution must therefore be based on very limited evidence, especially as they may still be under-recorded. However, comparison of pre-1930 and recent records suggests that P. pusillus may have increased in some areas, perhaps in response to eutrophication.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Potamogeton rutilus|This rhizomatous perennial grows submerged in unpolluted, mesotrophic or eutrophic lochs and adjoining streams, usually where there is some base-enrichment. It normally reproduces by turions, though it has recently been found fruiting in Scotland. Lowland.|Native|In 1962 P. rutilus was regarded as a very rare species, known only from the Outer Hebrides and Shetland. Intensive surveys of aquatic habitats have gradually revealed more colonies, and others doubtless remain to be discovered. It has apparently been lost from one site, Loch Flemington (Easterness), because of eutrophication.|European Boreal-montane element.
Potamogeton trichoides|P. trichoides is found in a range of still or slowly flowing, mesotrophic or eutrophic waters including lakes, ponds, rivers, canals, ditches and flooded mineral workings. It often colonises disturbed sites such as recently cleared canals and ditches. Lowland.|Native|Although the distribution of this elusive linear-leaved pondweed is better known now than at the time of the 1962 Atlas, it is probably still under-recorded as it is difficult to recognise, especially when growing with P. pusillus. There is evidence of a genuine increase in frequency since 1960 in the Somerset Levels, perhaps because of eutrophication.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element.
Potentilla anglica|A procumbent perennial of heaths, dry banks, woodland borders and field edges, usually on well-drained acidic soils, but avoiding podsols. It can also occur on waste ground and railway embankments. 0?410 m (Fron Hill, Rads.).|Native|P. anglica can be morphologically very similar to some forms of its hybrids with P. erecta or P. reptans, and the map may contain some errors. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. The current map suggests a decline in S. and E. England and C. Ireland. Analysis of the database reveals that many of these losses have occurred since 1950.|European Temperate element; also in N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Potentilla anserina|A stoloniferous perennial herb, occurring on dry, damp or periodically inundated soils in open grassy swards or on bare ground. Habitats include land subject to seasonal inundation with fresh or brackish water, upper saltmarsh, shorelines, dunes, rough ground and roadsides. It spreads vigorously by stolons, but fruiting is often poor. Generally lowland, but reaching 580 m at Hartside (Cumberland), and exceptionally at 845 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Potentilla argentea|A perennial herb of dry, freely-draining, gravelly or sandy soils, found in open grassy swards on commons, in pastures, on banks, in pits and on tracks and waste ground. Reproduction is by seed, but it does not readily colonise new sites. Lowland.|Native|The 1962 Atlas indicates a decline in P. argentea before 1930, and more sites have been lost subsequently. It may still be in slow decline, largely due to habitat loss. However, although populations can fluctuate dramatically in size they can be extremely long-lived.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Potentilla crantzii|A perennial herb of dry base-rich rock faces, cliffs and ledges, close-grazed calcareous grassland and, occasionally, river shingle. It is a pseudogamous apomict, reproducing mostly by seed, with very limited vegetative spread. Generally montane, reaching 1065 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth), but descending to 250 m in Assynt (W. Sutherland).|Native|Although some sites were lost before 1930, the distribution of this species seems to have been stable in recent years. Unlike P. neumanniana, British populations of P. crantzii are relatively homogeneous.|Eurosiberian Boreo-arctic Montane element; also in N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Potentilla erecta|A perennial herb found in a wide variety of habitats on more or less acidic soils, including lowland, upland and montane grassland, hay- and fen-meadows, moorland and heathland, blanket and raised mires, open woodland, wood borders and hedge banks. It is unpalatable to stock. 0-1040 m (Carrantuohill, S. Kerry).|Native|The distribution of P. erecta is stable, other than in S.E. England where a decline has taken place. Local floras indicate that these losses have occurred since 1950. Two subspecies are recognised; subsp. erecta is found throughout the range of the species and subsp. strictissima is mapped separately.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Potentilla fruticosa|In England, this shrub is found on basic, damp rock ledges and silty, sandy or gravelly river-flats liable to inundation. In Ireland, it occurs in rocky places subject to flooding, usually around loughs and turloughs. It also occurs as a garden escape or relic in waste places. 0-700 m (Pillar, Cumberland).|Native|Drainage and land clearance have caused some losses of this species in Ireland, and some English populations were lost before 1940. However, the current native distribution is stable and alien plants are increasing in frequency.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, but absent from Scandinavia and with a disjunct distribution elsewhere.
Potentilla neumanniana|An apomictic, perennial, mat-forming herb of undisturbed, dry, basic, open habitats including coastal limestone rocks, inland rocks, crags and screes on limestones and other basic rocks, and dry chalk grassland. Reproduction is by seed and by rooting stolons. Generally lowland, but reaching 335 m at Crosby Ravensworth (Westmorland); there are old records at 610 m from Loch Loch (E. Perth).|Native|This species has declined or been lost from many sites in S. England, particularly those on chalk and sand (such as Breckland). Populations on limestone crags and cliffs appear to be more stable. P. neumanniana is morphologically and cytologically variable.|European Temperate element.
Potentilla palustris|A rhizomatous perennial herb found in permanently flooded swamps, and in mires and wet meadows where the summer water table lies below the soil surface. It prefers nutrient-poor but slightly to moderately base-rich water and grows on a wide range of soils. Habitats include the edges of lakes, natural hollows, bog pools, peat cuttings and floating rafts of vegetation. 0-800 m (Tom a`Choinnich, E. Ross).|Native|P. palustris was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined since that date in S. and E. England and S. Ireland through drainage, agricultural improvement and a lack of grazing.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Potentilla reptans|A perennial herb of woodland rides, grassland, hedgerows, banks and roadsides, and waste and cultivated ground, generally on neutral to basic soils. It reproduces by seed and spreads rapidly by runners. Generally lowland, reaching 415 m at Stainmore (Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of P. reptans is generally stable. It may only be present as an introduction at scattered localities in Scotland north of its main range.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Potentilla rupestris|A perennial herb which, in three of its four native sites, grows in thin, dry soils in open, rocky or cliff habitats subject to summer drought. It grows over basic igneous rocks, but usually on mildly acidic soils. The southernmost site in Wales is a rock platform by a river, partially shaded by trees. Lowland.|Native|All populations are small, but currently appear to be more or less stable. The Craig Breidden (Monts.) site was much affected in the past by quarrying and the plant came close to extinction there, but the population has been bolstered by transplants.|Mediterranean-montane element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Potentilla sterilis|A perennial herb of relatively infertile, dry but not droughted soils in open woods, woodland margins, scrub, grassy hedge banks and rock crevices; also occasionally in meadows and on walls. In the lowlands it is usually found in partially shaded sites but it extends into open habitats in upland areas. 0-790 m (Helvellyn, Cumberland).|Native|There is no change in the distribution of P. sterilis since the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Temperate element; also in N. America.     © P. Shannon
Primula elatior|A perennial herb of woods dominated by Acer campestre, Corylus, Fraxinus and Quercus robur on damp chalky boulder-clay soils, especially where seasonal flooding occurs; rarely in wet Alnus woods, damp meadows and ancient hedgerows. Lowland.|Native|Agricultural improvement has all but eliminated this species from meadows since 1930, and in woodland numbers are reduced when coppicing ceases or conifers planted. Recently, increasing numbers of flowers have been eaten by deer. However, this has resulted in little change in the 10-km distribution.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; also in C. Asia.
Primula farinosa|A short-lived perennial herb typical of wet, usually spring-fed, calcareous flushes. It is often found on hummocks in springs, and on seeping banks where slippage has opened up the turf, most commonly on open marl. A few sites remain in unimproved, grazed, damp pasture. It perennates as resting-buds and reproduces by seed. 0-570 m (Jeffrey Pot, Wensleydale, N.W. Yorks.), but generally 200-400 m.|Native|P. farinosa is still frequent in suitable habitats, but local floras detail many losses due to drainage and agricultural improvement.|Eurasian Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © P. Shannon
Primula scotica|A perennial herb, growing in a variety of moist but well-drained, usually heavily grazed, open grassland habitats that are often on calcareous substrates and sometimes liable to some sand accretion. Sites include cliff-tops, the transition zone between grassland and maritime heath, mosaics of heath and machair, and around rock outcrops. It is self-fertile, but many plants never flower. Lowland.|Native|This species can be adversely affected by both under- and over-grazing, most losses being attributed to one or the other. Its overall distribution is, however, unchanged since the 1962 Atlas.|Endemic.
Primula veris|A perennial herb of well-drained, herb-rich grasslands on mesic to calcareous soils; less commonly on seasonally flooded soils, in scrub or woodland rides and edges, and on calcareous cliffs. 0-750 m (Knock Ore Gill, Westmorland), and exceptionally at 845 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|P. veris suffered a marked decline between 1930 and 1980 due to the ploughing or agricultural improvement of grassland. It has, however, recently become more frequent on road verges sown with this species or with wild-flower mixtures. The current map shows little change from the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Primula vulgaris|An evergreen, or sometimes aestivating, perennial herb typical of sites shaded from hot sun, found in woodland, on N.-facing banks, in hedgerows, coastal slopes and shaded montane cliffs. Reproduction is by seed, which is usually dispersed by ants. 0-850 m (Mt Brandon, S. Kerry).|Native|Unlike P. veris, populations of P. vulgaris have not fluctuated markedly during the last century in most parts of Britain and Ireland. However, in East Anglia woodland populations have declined greatly in response to a series of hot, dry summers from 1970 onwards (Rackham, 1999).|European Temperate element.
Prunella vulgaris|A patch-forming perennial herb of neutral and calcareous grassland, growing in clearings in woods, in meadows, pastures and lawns, on roadsides and waste ground, typically associated with moist, fertile soils. It forms clonal patches in short-grazed turf and spreads by the detachment of daughter ramets. 0-755 m (Knock Fell, Westmorland), and 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|P. vulgaris is very frequent throughout Britain and Ireland, and in areas where it has been mapped in detail it has usually proved to be present in almost all tetrads. There is no evidence for a change in overall distribution.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Prunus avium|The natural habitats of this small to medium-sized tree include deciduous woodland and hedges on fertile soils, but it is widely planted as an ornamental or fruit tree in parks and gardens. It spreads by fruit and suckers. 0-400 m (N. of Garrigill, Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of P. avium has not changed since the 1962 Atlas. It is frequently difficult to decide whether populations are native or alien, and all records have been mapped here as if they are native.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Prunus cerasifera|A shrub or small tree of roadsides, hedges, woods and copses and ornamental plantings. It rarely if ever suckers, and only occasionally sets fruit. Lowland.|Neophyte|There is considerable doubt about the history of this species in Britain. Known in cultivation in the 16th century, it was not recorded until the 20th century in many areas where it is now frequent. It may have been overlooked by recorders unaware of its early flowering, and there has been a vast increase in 10-km square records since the 1962 Atlas as this character has become more widely known. It may also be confused with varieties of P. domestica and P. spinosa.|Native of S.E. Europe, S.W. & C. Asia.     © P. Shannon
Prunus cerasus|A shrub or small tree of hedgerows, copses and wood-borders. It spreads by fruit or suckers, and can sometimes form dense thickets. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Cultivars of this species were being grown in the 16th century, and it is one of the parents of the Morello Cherry. Most populations have been deliberately planted, rather than bird-sown. The 1962 Atlas indicated a strong decline in England prior to 1930, but P. cerasus is much confused with P. avium and its past and present distribution is to that extent uncertain. There has been a small decline since the 1962 Atlas.|Native of S.W. Asia.
Prunus domestica|A shrub or tree, naturalised in hedges, wood-borders, scrub and waste places. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|This species has been grown in gardens since at least 995 (Harvey, 1981) and known from the wild since 1777. Three subspecies, subsp. domestica (plum), subsp. insititia (bullace) and subsp. italica (greengage) are often recognised. Many plants are relics of cultivation, but subsp. domestica is still being introduced from discarded plum stones. Although its overall range is similar to that in the 1962 Atlas, it is much better recorded.|Apparently derived from hybrids of P. cerasifera and P. spinosa; such hybrids occur in the Caucasus but P. domestica has been much modified in cultivation.     © P. Shannon
Prunus laurocerasus|A glossy-leaved evergreen shrub or small tree, naturalised in woods and scrub, and sometimes self-sown. Layering can occur when the branches of old trees lie on the ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|P. laurocerasus was being cultivated in Britain by 1629 and was known from the wild by 1886. It is now commonly planted for amenity, and the current map shows a much greater frequency than in the 1962 Atlas.|Native of the Balkan peninsula.
Prunus lusitanica|An evergreen shrub, frequently planted in parks and gardens, and now well-established in woods, scrub and on waste ground. It is frequently self-sown. Lowland.|Neophyte|P. lusitanica, cultivated in Britain by 1648, is less commonly planted than P. laurocerasus. It was noted in the wild by 1927, and may be unevenly recorded.|Native of the Iberian peninsula.
Prunus padus|A deciduous shrub or small tree of moist woodland and scrub, streamsides and shaded rocky places; also in fen-carr in East Anglia. It occurs on a wide variety of soil types, but is most frequent on damp calcareous or base-rich substrates, and avoids very dry or very acidic conditions. It spreads by fruit and suckers, often forming thickets. 0-650 m (Dove Crag, Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of P. padus is largely unchanged since the 1962 Atlas. It is widely planted both within, and to the south of, its native range. The distinction between native and alien populations is sometimes unclear.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Prunus spinosa|A deciduous shrub or small tree of open woodlands, scrub, hedgerows, screes and cliff-slopes; a prostrate form also occurs on shingle beaches. It grows on a wide variety of soils. It reproduces by seed, and spreads vegetatively by suckers, often forming dense thickets. In many areas, native populations have been augmented by deliberate planting in hedgerows and copses. 0-500 m (Cross Fell, Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of P. spinosa is stable.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Pseudofumaria lutea|A perennial herb, commonly cultivated and widely naturalised in Britain, less so in Ireland. It is most frequently found rooted into the crevices of old mortared walls, pavements and other masonry, and on brick rubble and stony waste ground. Once established in an area, it can quickly colonise new sites. Generally lowland, but reaching 305 m at Great Hucklow (Derbys.).|Neophyte|P. lutea was being grown in Britain by 1596; it was first recorded in the wild in 1796 and became widespread in the early 1800s. Since the 1962 Atlas it has clearly increased in some areas, such as Wales and S.W. England.|Native of the southern foothills of the S.W. & C. Alps; widely naturalised elsewhere in Europe.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Pseudorchis albida|A tuberous perennial herb of well-drained hill pastures, streamsides, mountain grasslands and cliff ledges on a range of dry, acidic or calcareous soils; also on recently burnt moorland, but not persisting when Calluna regrows. Rarely, it occurs in acidic Quercus woodland. 0-550 m (Ben Chaisteil, Main Argyll).|Native|Many lowland sites for P. albida were lost before 1930 due to habitat destruction, agricultural improvement and overgrazing. There have been continued losses since then, although it is now much better recorded. However, it is inconspicuous and may be under-recorded in some areas, especially in the uplands.|European Boreal-montane element; also in N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Pseudotsuga menziesii|A very tall evergreen tree of plantations and policy woodlands, usually planted in sheltered, well-drained sites; also found in parks and large gardens as a specimen tree. Seed production in Britain is erratic, with long gaps between mast years, but natural regeneration occurs fairly widely. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Neophyte|P. menziesii was introduced to Britain in 1826, and was recorded from the wild by 1968. It is locally common in forestry and very widespread in estate woodland. A 63 m specimen at Dunkeld, Perthshire, may currently be the tallest tree of any species in Britain. It is under-recorded.|Native of western N. America; very widely planted in Europe and elsewhere.
Pteridium aquilinum|A deciduous fern of moorland, hill pasture and other habitats on acidic soils. It is most vigorous when growing on deep loam, sands or alluvium and is rare on base-rich soils. 0-585 m (Lochnagar, S. Aberdeen), and probably higher elsewhere.|Native|P. aquilinum increased markedly in the 20th century, apparently in response to more intensive sheep grazing and more frequent burning of hill vegetation. In the 1970s it was invading more than 10 000 hectares of agricultural land annually. This expansion is not apparent at the 10-km scale as the species was almost ubiquitous in the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Puccinellia distans|A perennial herb growing on barish muddy ground near the sea, along the upper edges of saltmarshes, on sea walls and amongst coastal rocks; also in saline areas inland, and as a colonist by salt-treated roads. It favours compacted, poorly-drained, heavy soils. Lowland, with a roadside record at 520 m at Holme Moss (Cheshire).|Native|As in the 1962 Atlas, this map includes records for subsp. distans and subsp. borealis; the latter is also mapped separately. Whilst its coastal distribution is stable (apart from being much better recorded in N. Scotland), it has spread rapidly along roadsides since 1970.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Puccinellia fasciculata|A tufted perennial herb of bare places by the sea, in grazing marshes around cattle-poached pools and depressions, on earthen sea walls, vehicle tracks and the mud dredged from ditches. It also occurs rarely beside salt-treated roads inland. Lowland.|Native|This species has probably decreased in some areas as a result of the infilling of pools and ditches, the upgrading of sea walls and the conversion of coastal grazing marshes to arable. It now includes P. pseudodistans (as P. fasciculata var. pseudodistans), which was mapped separately in the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element; also in N. America.
Puccinellia maritima|A stoloniferous perennial herb of saltmarshes, often dominant over large areas in the lower and middle marsh, and in pans and depressions in the upper marsh; also locally on bare saline soils above the tidal limit, on sea walls and beside grazing marsh ditches. Rarely, it occurs in saline areas inland, and as a colonist by salt-treated roads. Lowland.|Native|The coastal distribution of P. maritima has remained largely unchanged since the 1962 Atlas. Since the early 1970s it has been recorded occasionally alongside salt-treated roads in England.|Oceanic Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Puccinellia rupestris|An annual or biennial herb growing on bare saline soils above the tidal limit, behind sea walls, on tracks and in grazing marshes around cattle-trodden pools and depressions, and sometimes on firm muddy shingle and in rock crevices. P. rupestris occurs rarely inland by saline springs and salt-treated roads. Lowland.|Native|P. rupestris was declining in N. England before 1930, and is now practically extinct north of The Wash. It has also declined in S. England, probably due to the infilling of pools and ditches, upgrading of sea walls and the conversion of coastal grazing marshes to arable. It was recorded before 1930 in S.E. Scotland as a ballast alien.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Pulicaria dysenterica|A perennial, rhizomatous herb of damp or wet, open habitats including marshy places, water- and fen-meadows, tall-herb fens, by rivers, streams, canals and ditches, in dune-slacks, wet hollows and seepages on sea-cliffs, damp woodland rides and roadside verges. It is found on a wide range of acidic and base-rich soil types. 0-325 m (Llyn Brianne, Cards.).|Native|The distribution of P. dysenterica is stable.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; it reaches its northern limit in eastern Denmark.
Pulicaria vulgaris|An annual of damp, winter-flooded hollows in somewhat acidic, unimproved grassland on New Forest `lawns`, on commons and village greens, and on rutted tracks. Extant sites are usually pony-grazed, this disturbance creating the open conditions needed for seedling survival. Lowland.|Native|Most sites for this species were lost before 1930. More recently, outside the New Forest (S. Hants.), it was lost from Wiltshire in the 1970s and the remaining sites in N. Hampshire and Surrey are very small. Losses are largely due to lack of grazing on commons, the infilling of ponds and drainage.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; it is declining throughout Europe and now reaches its northern native limit in Surrey.
Pulmonaria longifolia|A perennial herb of lightly shaded habitats, mostly on base-rich clay soils, in coppiced woodland, wood-pasture and Pteridium aquilinum heathland; it also grows in hedge banks and marl-pits. Though it seeds freely and reproduces vegetatively, even vigorous colonies seldom spread into apparently suitable contiguous ground. Lowland.|Native|Although P. longifolia is mapped here in a few more 10-km squares than in the 1962 Atlas, this is mainly due to more intensive recording, and some colonies have been lost, particularly from hedge banks. It is sometimes grown in gardens, and occasional escapes have been noted.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Pulmonaria obscura|This perennial herb grows on poorly drained chalky boulder clay in three ancient woods with a long history of coppice management; Acer campestre, Corylus and Fraxinus are the usual dominant trees. It reproduces by seed and by rhizomatous spread. Lowland.|Native|P. obscura is considered native in Britain because its habitat and associated species are similar to those in its native N. Europe, and because it is rarely cultivated here. It has declined in two woods since the 1930s due to the cessation of coppicing, and has been lost from another through habitat destruction.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Pulmonaria officinalis|A perennial herb, naturalised in woodlands and scrub, on banks and rough ground, and also occurring on rubbish tips and waste ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 385 m (Forest-in-Teesdale, Co. Durham).|Neophyte|This species was cultivated in Britain before 1597, and is now commonly grown in gardens. Though some occurrences were treated as possibly native in the 1962 Atlas, it is now regarded as an introduction at all its British sites; it was recorded from the wild by 1793. The number of records has increased since the 1962 Atlas, particularly in southern England, reflecting both increased abundance and more intensive recording of aliens.|A European Temperate species, absent as a native from much of W. Europe.
Pulsatilla vulgaris|A perennial rhizomatous herb of species-rich turf on the slopes of chalk or oolite escarpments, and the banks of ancient earthworks, usually with a S. or S.W. aspect. Plants produce viable seed, but seedling establishment is rare. Lowland.|Native|This species was lost from many sites as a result of agricultural improvements in the 18th and 19th centuries. The decline continues, even on nature reserves, as relict chalk grassland ceases to be grazed and suffers from fertiliser drift. It also occurs as a garden escape and may have been planted on the Wiltshire/Dorset border.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Pyrola media|A rhizomatous, mycorrhizal, evergreen perennial herb of well-drained, mildly acidic to slightly basic soils in woods and on heaths. It is characteristic of Arctostaphylos-Calluna submontane heath derived from former woodland. 0-550 m (Coire Garbhlach, Easterness).|Native|P. media has been much over-recorded in the past for P. minor, with which it often grows. This may, in part, account for the apparently substantial historic decline. It is also very shy-flowering and may be under-recorded. Recently unfavourable woodland management and increased moorland grazing may have contributed to some losses.|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element.     © Pete Stroh
Pyrola minor|A rhizomatous, mycorrhizal, perennial evergreen herb. In S. England it is a plant of damp woodlands with deep litter, on a variety of soils; elsewhere it occurs in damp places in heaths, plantations, disused railways, on rock ledges and in sand dunes. 0-1130 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|This species has declined throughout its scattered British range through changes in land use and management. Most losses in the south occurred before 1930. The small, southern woodland populations appear particularly vulnerable, with recent losses as sites have become too dry. It sometimes colonises plantations, where it may be introduced or arrive naturally by wind-blown seed.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Pyrola rotundifolia||||
Pyrus communis sens.lat.|Deciduous trees or shrubs found in hedges, woodland margins and old gardens, and on railway banks and waste ground. They spread easily by seed and by discarded cores. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|P. communis sens. lat. has been grown in gardens since at least 995 (Harvey, 1981). Records have increased since the 1962 Atlas, but this is almost certainly due to better recording. The cultivated pear (P. communis) and wild pear (P. pyraster) are rarely distinguished by recorders.|P. communis sens. lat. includes P. pyraster, which may be native to C. & S. Europe and S.W. & C. Asia, and P. communis, which has a hybrid origin in cultivation.
Pyrus communis sens.str.||||
Pyrus cordata|In Britain, this small deciduous tree is restricted to just a few hedgerows in Devon and Cornwall. Reproduction is by suckering; fruit-set varies greatly from year to year, and production of fertile seed is negligible. Lowland.|Native|or alien. P. cordata, which was first recorded in 1870, has always been very rare in Britain, and its low seed-fertility offers little scope for it to spread naturally to new sites.

Quercus cerris|A deciduous tree planted in woodlands, town parks, estates, large gardens and along roads, especially on acidic, sandy soils. It seeds freely, and has become naturalised on free-draining soils in other habitats including railway embankments and waste ground, spreading into calcareous grassland and heathland. Lowland.|Neophyte|Q. cerris was cultivated in Britain by 1735 and has been known from the wild since at least 1905. There has been a dramatic increase in records since the 1962 Atlas, due to both a genuine increase and better recording of aliens. Its free regeneration threatens the native flora at some sites.|A native of S.C. & S.E. Europe and S.W. Asia.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Quercus ilex|An evergreen tree, planted in parks, large gardens, churchyards and cemeteries, and becoming well-established in copses, woodland and on sand dunes. It prefers light, warm soils, and is frequently planted near coasts. Seed production can be prolific, and it regenerates freely in parts of S. and E. England. Lowland.|Neophyte|Q. ilex has been cultivated since the 16th century, and was widely planted in the 18th century. It was recorded in the wild in 1862. It can colonise natural habitats aggressively and replace native vegetation. The significant increase in records since the 1962 Atlas is due to better recording and a genuine spread in the south.|Native of the Mediterranean region.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Quercus petraea|A long-lived, deciduous tree, forming high forest or coppice woodland, especially on well-drained, shallow, moderately to strongly acidic soils. It is the characteristic species of upland oakwoods. Seedlings of Q. petraea may be more shade-tolerant than those of Q. robur and is therefore more able to regenerate in woodland. 0?450 m (Kesdadale, Cumberland).|Native|Q. petraea was not favoured by 18th and 19th century foresters, and it tends to have a relict distribution in Britain and Ireland. The map may underestimate the extent to which it is introduced at the eastern edge of the range.|European Temperate element.
Quercus robur|A long-lived, deciduous tree of high forest, coppice woodland and ancient wood-pasture. It grows on a wide range of soils, typically those which are heavy and fertile, but does not thrive on thin soils over limestone or acidic peat. It is fairly tolerant of waterlogging, growing at fen margins and in Alnus woodland. It is very widely planted in hedges and woodland. 0-450 m (Talgarth, Brecs.).|Native|The dominance of Q. robur in many woods is the result of many centuries of selective woodland management, followed by deliberate planting in recent centuries. All records are mapped as if they are native.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Radiola linoides|A small annual of damp, bare, infertile, peaty or sandy ground in acid grasslands and heaths, by ponds, on tracks and in woodland rides. Near the coast it occurs in dune-slacks, sandy grassland, on machair, and in soil-filled rock cracks. Lowland.|Native|R. linoides suffered a considerable decline before 1930, largely due to the loss of lowland heaths or a lack of grazing and disturbance on them. These losses have continued in England: it was lost from 95% of a sample of sites in Dorset between 1935 and 1992 and remaining populations are very small. Its distribution seems to be stable elsewhere. It is easily overlooked and may be under-recorded in some areas.|European Temperate element.
Ranunculus acris|A perennial herb of damp meadows and pastures on a wide variety of soils, only avoiding very dry or acid conditions. It is a characteristic plant of unimproved hay and water-meadow communities, and now of relict herb-rich fragments on damp road verges; it also grows on dune grassland, in montane flushes and in tall-herb communities on rock ledges. It is unpalatable to grazing animals, but easily controlled in intensively managed pastures. 0-1220 m (Cairntoul, S. Aberdeen).|Native|The distribution of R. acris is stable.|Eurasian Wide-boreal element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-boreal.
Ranunculus aquatilis|This is an annual or short-lived perennial which grows in shallow water in marshes, ponds and ditches, and at the edge of slow-flowing streams and sheltered lakes. It occurs chiefly in water which is eutrophic and at least mildly base-rich, and is favoured by a degree of disturbance. Generally lowland, but reaching 445 m at Small Water (Cumberland).|Native|The map of R. aquatilis in the 1962 Atlas included records of R. peltatus and R. penicillatus, as the taxonomy of these species was then unresolved. It is, therefore, difficult to assess changes in the distribution of the individual species.|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia and western N. America.     © Shannon, P
Ranunculus aquatilis sens.lat.||||
Ranunculus arvensis|An annual of arable land on loams, sands, clays and chalk. The seeds are long-lived, and plants sometimes reappear on disturbed waste ground, or in gardens or new roadside verges on former arable land. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|R. arvensis has been present in Britain since Roman times. In the 1962 Atlas a decline in this species was only apparent at the northern fringe of its range but since then it has declined dramatically. The losses reflect the intensification of arable farming, and in particular improved seed screening and herbicide treatments.|As an archaeophyte R. arvensis has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Ranunculus auricomus|A perennial, characteristic of deciduous woodland on chalk, limestone and other basic soils. It also grows in scrub, on roadsides and in churchyards, and rarely on open moorland sheltered by boulders and on montane ledges. It is apomictic, showing considerable variation throughout Europe, though the agamospecies have not yet been formally described in our area. Generally lowland, but reaching 1090 m on Aonach Beag (Westerness).|Native|The range of R. auricomus is remarkably stable, although improved recording has led to the discovery of more sites within the range and a number of outlying populations in N. Scotland.|European Boreo-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Ranunculus baudotii|This annual or perennial herb grows in coastal water bodies, including lagoons, machair lochs, ditches, pools, dune-slacks and borrow-pits. It is most frequent in water 0.5-1 m deep, but can grow in shallower water or as a dwarf terrestrial form on wet mud. Its inland sites include flooded mineral workings and canals, some receiving saline drainage water but others lacking any saline influence. Lowland.|Native|R. baudotii is now known to be much more frequent than was appreciated at the time of the 1962 Atlas. Many of the pre-1970 records date from the 19th century, suggesting a long-term decline in some areas.|European Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Ranunculus bulbosus|A perennial herb with a corm-like stem-base, found on well-drained, neutral or calcareous soils in meadows, pastures and dunes. It is absent from highly productive, fertile grassland and from strongly acidic soils. Generally lowland, but reaching 580 m on Dartmoor (S. Devon) and at Hartside (Westmorland).|Native|R. bulbosus has maintained its range, and can be locally abundant. The map suggests a slight decline towards its northern and western limits, but the species is most readily recorded up to early summer and may have been overlooked in some areas.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Ranunculus circinatus|A perennial herb of clear, base-rich, standing or very slowly flowing water, most frequently in lakes, flooded gravel-pits, sluggish streams and rivers, canals and ditches. It usually grows at depths of 1-3 m in meso-eutrophic or eutrophic water; only growing in shallower water if it does not dry up in summer. 0-310 m (Akermoor Loch, Selkirks.).|Native|Unlike most aquatic Ranunculus species, this is an easily recognised plant which should be well recorded. It has declined across much of its range because of habitat destruction and eutrophication. It was lost from many sites before 1930, but the decline has continued since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Ranunculus ficaria|An aestivating perennial herb that grows in woods, hedge banks, meadows, roadsides, maritime grassland, the banks of rivers and streams and shaded waste ground. It prefers damp, loamy or clay soils, and avoids very dry, very acidic or permanently waterlogged sites. 0?750 m (Loch Lochy, Westerness), but probably higher elsewhere in Scotland.|Native|The distribution of R. ficaria is stable. Losses at the fringe of its Scottish range probably reflect a lack of recent fieldwork in spring. The species is morphologically and cytologically variable; the two native subspecies are mapped separately.|European Southern-temperate element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Ranunculus flammula|A perennial herb of wet habitats, particularly those with seasonal water level fluctuations. It is found in springs and flushes, around ponds, on lake shores, streamsides, in dune-slacks, marshes, water-meadows, flood pastures, bogs and in ditches and track ruts. It usually grows in oligotrophic or mesotrophic water over neutral to acid substrates. 0-930 m (Carnedd Llewelyn, Caerns.).|Native|There is some evidence for a loss of R. flammula in S.E. England, but it remains frequent elsewhere. Subsp. flammula occurs throughout the British and Irish range of the species; the two rarer subspecies are mapped separately.|European Temperate element.     © Shannon, P
Ranunculus fluitans|This is a perennial species which grows in large, rapidly flowing rivers with a stable substrate. It is usually found in base-rich and meso-eutrophic water. In Ireland, it is confined to a single, now locally highly polluted, river. Lowland.|Native|This is not a well-understood species; in some areas of Britain it may be under-recorded whereas in others it may be reported in error for other taxa. Historically R. penicillatus subsp. pseudofluitans may have been recorded as R. fluitans, whereas now hybrids with R. fluitans as one parent are more likely to be reported as the species.|European Temperate element.
Ranunculus hederaceus|A small annual or short-lived perennial, found at the edge of small water bodies and by the sheltered backwaters of rivers. It often grows on the cattle-poached edges of ponds, ditches and streams, in wet gateways and on paths and tracks. It tolerates a broad range of pH and nutrient levels, including nitrophilous conditions. 0-770 m (Little Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|This species was lost from some sites in S.E. England before 1900 as a result of agricultural improvement and urban spread. It has declined since 1950 in areas where the agriculture is now mostly arable, but remains frequent elsewhere.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Ranunculus lingua|A stoloniferous perennial herb which grows in fens and marshes, on ditch, canal and pond edges, around reservoirs and in flooded gravel-pits and quarries. It is normally found in base-rich, still or slowly flowing water. Lowland.|Native|The 1962 Atlas illustrated the decline of native R. lingua in Britain, a result of drainage over the last two hundred years. Since 1962, however, the situation has been transformed by its increased popularity as an ornamental plant. It is frequently introduced to ponds and other wetlands in the wild and the distinction between native and alien populations is now hopelessly blurred. In Ireland the native plant is still locally frequent.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Ranunculus muricatus|An erect annual found naturalised as a weed of cultivated ground in S.W. England, particularly in bulb-fields and gardens in the Isles of Scilly, and as a bird-seed, grain and wool alien elsewhere. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species, in cultivation in Britain by 1683, was known in the wild by 1859 (Surrey). It has decreased as a casual, presumably through improved seed cleaning techniques.|Native of S.W. Europe and the Mediterranean region.
Ranunculus omiophyllus|A small annual or short-lived perennial which grows in shallow water or on wet soil. Typical sites include the margins of ponds and ditches, flushes, damp depressions, gateways and tracks in pastures and on heathland, and the sheltered backwaters of rivers. Unlike R. hederaceus, it is confined to acidic, mesotrophic or oligotrophic soils. 0-1005 m (Carnedd Llewelyn, Caerns.).|Native|R. omiophyllus remains frequent in W. Britain and S. Ireland, where there are many more records than there were in the 1962 Atlas. The decline at the fringes of its range was already discernible in the 1962 Atlas, and is now much more marked.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © Shannon, P
Ranunculus ophioglossifolius|An annual found in a highly specialised marshy habitat. It requires winter inundation, bare, wet mud for seedling establishment, reduced summer water levels and low competition. The substrate at the two extant sites is base-rich Lias clay, with most water input from rain. Lowland.|Native|Sites in S. Hampshire, Dorset and Jersey were lost by the early twenteenth century. The largest surviving population, at Badgeworth (E. Gloucs.), has been dependent on management since 1962, and with appropriate human disturbance a sizeable population of plants flower and fruit every year. A smaller site nearby is still managed by grazing, and that population is more erratic.|European Southern-temperate element.
Ranunculus paludosus|A winter-green perennial herb which dies down to spindle-shaped tubers after flowering in May. It grows in grassland which is wet in winter, but sun-baked in summer. The number of flowering plants in a population may vary considerably from year to year. Lowland.|Native|This species has always been restricted in our area to Jersey, where it was discovered in 1872. It was long thought to be an extreme rarity, but its habitat requirements were not understood until the late 1950s. It was then discovered in a number of sites on the west and south coast of the island.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element, reaching its northern limit in Jersey.
Ranunculus parviflorus|An annual of dry disturbed habitats on a range of neutral and calcareous soils. Typical sites include broken turf on cliff edges, open, droughted slopes and banks, rabbit scrapes, tracks, poached gateways, building sites and gardens. The seeds appear to be long-lived, and populations may reappear after disturbance or persist for many years. Lowland.|Native|The retreat of this species south-westwards in Britain had already taken place by 1930. Its distribution appears to be stable within its core areas. It is rare and decreasing in Ireland.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Ranunculus peltatus|This perennial or sometimes annual species grows in slow-flowing streams and rivers, coastal lagoons, shallow lakes, ditches, ponds and dune-slacks. It is difficult to define its ecological preferences, as it grows in the upper reaches of highly calcareous rivers but in some areas favours base-poor waters; it has a broad trophic range. Generally lowland, but reaching 500 m at Dogber Tarn (Westmorland).|Native|The larger aquatic species of Ranunculus are difficult to identify, and the map may contain some errors. In the 1962 Atlas, records for this species were included in the map of R. aquatilis, so changes in distribution are difficult to assess.|European Wide-temperate element.
Ranunculus penicillatus|A vigorous perennial species of moderate to rapidly flowing rivers and streams, growing in oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters. Generally lowland, but reaching 310 m in the Carlcroft Burn (Cheviot).|Native|The taxonomy of the R. penicillatus aggregate was not elucidated until 1966, and the subspecies were not mapped separately until 1988. The riparian Ranunculus taxa still present formidable difficulties of identification, especially as both sterile and fertile hybrids occur in addition to the recognised species. Subsp. penicillatus and subsp. pseudofluitans are mapped separately.|European Temperate element, but the distribution of the species and its subspecies is clouded by taxonomic uncertainty.
Ranunculus repens|A perennial herb with creeping stems, R. repens has a very wide ecological tolerance, but is most typical of disturbed habitats on damp or wet nutrient-rich soils, including woodland rides, ditch sides, farm gateways, gardens and waste ground. It also occurs in damp or periodically flooded grasslands, in dune-slacks and on lake shores. It is absent from very acidic soils. Generally lowland, but reaching 1035 m on Snowdon (Caerns.).|Native|An extremely common species with a stable distribution.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.
Ranunculus reptans|A stoloniferous perennial herb of lake shores, growing on gravel or silty sand. At the Loch of Strathbeg (N. Aberdeen), where it has been known since 1876, it grows in open vegetation in a zone of Eleocharis palustris which is intermittently exposed above the water level in summer. Lowland.|Native|At some sites R. reptans may be a transient member of the British flora, perhaps introduced as seed by migrating wildfowl but not persisting for long. It can hybridise with the common R. flammula, and the hybrid R. x levenensis forms persistent populations in Britain and is also recorded from Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Ranunculus sardous|An annual of damp coastal pastures, poached pond edges and wet hollows, road verges, farm tracks and gateways. It is generally restricted to thin turf or disturbed areas on damp, neutral, moderately fertile soils. Lowland.|Native|R. sardous was first recorded in Britain in 1663. It was last recorded before 1930 from most of the inland sites for which only pre-1970 records are available. It may have been only a casual introduction at some of these localities, perhaps as an impurity of grass seed in sown leys. It persists in submaritime regions of England and Wales, where it is much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Ranunculus sceleratus|An annual of shallow water or wet, disturbed, nutrient-rich mud, especially at the edges of ponds, ditches, streams or rivers which are poached by drinking livestock. It is salt-tolerant and frequent on grazed estuarine marshes. Its seeds are long-lived and plants can re-appear following disturbance after many years of absence. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of R. sceleratus is stable, although the species is now better recorded than it was in the 1962 Atlas, especially in Scotland and Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Ranunculus trichophyllus|A small annual or perennial which grows in shallow, still or very slowly flowing water. It is most frequent in ponds, dune-slacks and drainage ditches, but it is also found in larger sites if they are sheltered. It tolerates a range of water chemistry but is most frequent in mesotrophic or eutrophic water. 0-310 m (Alston Moor, Cumberland).|Native|The aquatic Ranunculus species are difficult to identify, and this early-flowering plant is easily overlooked. Under-recording rather than decline may therefore be the reason for the concentration of pre-1970 records in some areas as there is little evidence of decline in neighbouring counties.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element.
Ranunculus tripartitus|An annual of shallow water bodies over base- and nutrient-poor substrates, in open sites which are flooded in winter but summer-dry. In S.E. England it is also found in pools in coppiced woodland. Lowland to 300 m at Belstone (N. Devon).|Native|Habitat destruction or reduced disturbance have led to the gradual decline of this species from the end of the 19th century onwards. However, it has recently been discovered at some new and historical British sites, and in 2000 it was refound in Ireland. Some mapped records may represent its hybrid with R. omiophyllus.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Raphanus raphanistrum||||
Raphanus raphanistrum subsp.maritimus|A biennial or perennial herb found in open coastal grassland, sand dunes, shingle, cliffs and disturbed ground by the sea. On parts of the east coast of Britain it grows on muddy shores. Lowland.|Native|Authors of many local floras have commented that R. raphanistrum subsp. maritimus has become more frequent in the last hundred years (e.g. Brewis et al., 1996; Margetts & David, 1981). The results of the current survey provide additional support for this view.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; it reaches its northern limit in Scotland.
Raphanus raphanistrum subsp.raphanistrum|An annual found as a casual or persistent weed in cultivated fields and on roadsides and waste ground. 0?380 m (Langdon Beck, Co. Durham).|Archaeophyte|R. raphanistrum subsp. raphanistrum was a noxious weed, but is easily controlled by selective herbicides and now appears to be much less common than in the past. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that most losses have occurred since 1950.|As an archaeophyte, this subspecies has a European Southern-temperate distribution but is widely naturalised outside this range. It presumably evolved from other subspecies and spread as a weed of cultivation.
Reseda lutea|A biennial or perennial herb of well-drained soils in open habitats, occurring on waste ground and roadside verges, in marginal grassland, disused railway land, quarries and arable land, in disturbed chalk and limestone grassland and on fixed sand dunes. Generally lowland, but reaching 440 m near Stainmore (Westmorland).|Native|R. lutea was recorded in Britain by 1597. There has been no significant change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Reseda luteola|A robust biennial herb which typically occurs on neutral or base-rich soils on roadsides, waste ground and marginal land, in brick yards, gravel-pits and urban demolition sites, and, less commonly, arable or grassy areas. Generally lowland, but reaching 400 m on a roadside N. of Shap Summit (Westmorland).|Archaeophyte|The range of this species has been stable over many years, and has not changed appreciably since the 1962 Atlas. However, it now appears to be more frequent within its range.|As an archaeophyte R. luteola has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © P.

Rhamnus cathartica|This strongly calcicolous shrub or small tree is found in a variety of habitats, including as an undershrub in woodland (usually Fraxinus and Quercus), in scrub and hedgerows and in fen-carr and damp Alnus woods. Reproduction is by seed, and it regenerates from cut stools and after grazing or burning. 0-380 m (near Malham Tarn, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|There is some evidence of a decline in the distribution of R. cathartica in W. Britain since the 1962 Atlas, although it is now much better recorded in Ireland.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Rhinanthus angustifolius|This annual root-parasite was formerly a widespread weed of arable land in E. Britain. However, most of the remaining sites are on the North Downs, in grassland and open scrub on chalk. In Lincolnshire, it occurs on peat in an area of cleared Pteridium and on railway ballast. In Angus, a tiny colony survives in sandy coastal grassland. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was first recorded in the wild in 1724. Nearly all its pre-1970 sites were lost before 1930. It was not recognised on the North Downs until 1966 (Lousley, 1976a). Hay cutting after flowering at some of its North Downs sites may have assisted its spread. Some old records may be errors for the variable R. minor.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.
Rhinanthus minor|An annual root-hemiparasite of nutrient-poor grasslands, including permanent pastures, hay meadows, the drier parts of fens, flushes in lowland and upland grasslands, and on montane ledges; also on roadsides and waste ground. 0-1065 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|R. minor declined throughout the 20th century in semi-natural grasslands. It is now included in many wild-flower seed mixtures. It is very variable and six intergrading and apparently inter-fertile subspecies have been recognised in our area. However, whilst they show broad geographic and ecological distinctions, some local races cannot be clearly assigned to any of them.|European Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Rhododendron ponticum|An evergreen shrub naturalised on heathy and rocky hillsides, rocky stream banks and ravines, and as an understorey in woodland on acid soils. It regenerates from seed freely and can form dense thickets. 0-600 m (Eel Crags, Cumberland).|Neophyte|The pollen record shows that R. ponticum was native to Ireland in the Hoxnian interglacial. In the current interglacial it was introduced to cultivation in 1763 and most, if not all, our plants derive from Spanish stock. It was known in the wild by at least 1894 and spread widely in the 20th century, but its initial expansion is poorly documented. Its distribution is now stable.|Native of two, disjunct areas: the Iberian peninsula and S.E. Europe, Lebanon, Turkey and the Caucasus.
Rhynchospora alba|A perennial herb of base-poor acidic bogs, wet heaths and mires, often in association with Sphagnum species. It is intolerant of competition, preferring open sites, and is frequently found on bare wet peat, sometimes in shallow standing water. Generally lowland, but reaching 850 m (Clogwyn y Garnedd, Caerns.).|Native|Many former lowland sites of R. alba were lost in the 19th century as a result of drainage, peat extraction and afforestation. Since the 1962 Atlas more sites have been lost in S. England, but its distribution elsewhere has been largely stable.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Rhynchospora fusca|A rhizomatous perennial of wet heaths, and the margins of acidic mires, favouring bare peat where competition is limited but preferring somewhat drier sites than R. alba in the south of its range. It spreads vegetatively, and may reproduce by seed. Lowland.|Native|Although most English sites for R. fusca outside its core area had been lost before 1930, more have now gone, sometimes as a result of drainage but more frequently because of invading carr following the reduction or cessation of grazing. However, it is much better recorded in Scotland since the 1962 Atlas. In Ireland, there has been a widespread decline.|Suboceanic Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Ribes alpinum|A dioecious shrub of limestone woods, rocky hedgerows and streamsides, often trailing over small cliffs and steep rocks in shaded places. It is also grown in gardens, and is found naturalised on roadsides, waste land and as a relic of cultivation. Generally lowland, reaching 365 m at Wormhill (Derbys.).|Native|Even within the areas where it is considered native, the distribution of this species has been obscured by escapes from cultivation as the species is widely planted for hedging or ornament. R. alpinum is better recorded than for the 1962 Atlas, and the distribution is stable.|European Boreal-montane element, but absent from the Boreal zonobiome.
Ribes nigrum|A shrub of damp woods, hedgerows and shaded streamsides, often near habitation. 0-390 m (Ingleborough, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Neophyte|R. nigrum does not appear to have been cultivated until shortly after 1600 when plants were imported from Holland. It was first recorded in the wild in 1660 and occurs as a naturalised escape throughout Britain, although some have considered it to be native in fen-carr and wet woodlands in East Anglia (Beckett et al., 1999).|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Ribes rubrum|A shrub of woods, hedges and fen-carr. Generally lowland, but reaching 455 m in Teesdale (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|This species was recorded in Britain by 1568. Small fruited plants in fen-carr and by streams in woods may be native. However, this species is widely naturalised; large fruited plants near old habitations are clearly relics of cultivation. The distinction between alien and native records is now so confused that all records in Britain are mapped as if they are native; it is alien in Ireland. The increase since the 1962 Atlas may partly be due to improved recording.|Suboceanic Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Ribes spicatum|A shrub of northern limestone woods, streamsides, ravines and deep grikes in limestone pavement. Generally lowland, but reaching 465 m above Malham (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|The native distribution of this species is difficult to ascertain, as cast-outs from cultivation have occasionally become established in the wild. Because identification of this species can only be certain when flowers are present, it has been under-recorded in the past. This is probably still the case, as the flowering season is early.|European Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Ribes uva-crispa|A spiny, much-branched shrub, found as a garden escape and throw-out in deciduous woodland, hedges and scrub. It also occurs as a relic of cultivation. It is readily dispersed by birds. 0-380 m at Ingleborough (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Neophyte|R. uva-crispa has been grown in British gardens since the 13th century but was not recorded in the wild until 1763 (Cambs.). Its distribution has increased since the 1962 Atlas, probably due to continued escape of plants from gardens.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Robinia pseudoacacia|A deciduous tree, extensively planted, and spreading by suckering and, less often, by seed. Its seedlings arise on roadsides, in pavement cracks and on waste ground in urban areas. It also occurs in woods and on scrubby banks, but only does well on light soils. Lowland.|Neophyte|R. pseudoacacia was introduced in the 1630s and was known from the wild by at least 1888.|Native of eastern N. America; widely naturalised from planted trees in C. & S. Europe, where its suckering can become a serious problem.
Romulea columnae|A cormous perennial herb of short, open turf on freely-draining sandy ground and cliff-slopes near the sea. Reproduction is mostly by seed, with division of the corm apparently much less significant. Lowland.|Native|There is no indication of change in the distribution of R. columnae since the 1962 Atlas, and its populations are stable in the Channel Islands (where it is common in suitable habitats) and at its sole British locality at Dawlish Warren (S. Devon). It was last reported from Cornwall in 1881.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Rorippa amphibia|A perennial herb of emergent vegetation along the edges of streams and rivers, by lakes and ponds and in other swampy ground. It often grows in sites which are flooded in winter and where some water remains in the summer, and is usually found where the water is calcareous and eutrophic. Seed set is often poor, possibly because plants are highly self-incompatible, and spread is mainly by fragmentation of mature plants. Lowland.|Native|R. amphibia is better recorded both in Britain and especially in Ireland than it was in the 1962 Atlas. However, it has declined in some areas and was lost from Somerset after 1972.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Rorippa islandica||||
Rorippa microphylla|A perennial herb growing in and beside streams, ditches, ponds and canals, and in marshes. This species extends into rather more acidic sites than R. nasturtium-aquaticum, and in some areas is the most common segregate on non-calcareous soils. 0?550 m (near Moor House, Westmorland).|Native|This segregate is almost certainly still under-recorded; it may be more frequent in N. England and E. Scotland than our records suggest. It is not commercially cultivated as watercress.|World distribution uncertain; it is known to be widespread in Europe and naturalised in C. & S. Africa, N. America and Australasia.
Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum|A perennial herb, found both in and beside clear shallow streams and in ditches, ponds, canals and marshes. Although it grows in similar habitats to R. microphylla, it tends to be restricted to calcareous substrates. It is also cultivated, but not as often as R. x sterilis. Lowland.|Native|Although R. nasturtium-aquaticum was mapped in Perring & Sell (1968), that map was too provisional for any assessment of subsequent change to be made. Some losses have occurred, but the species is probably still under-recorded in some areas.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.
Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum agg.|These perennial herbs grow beside streams both in calcareous and acidic areas, and favour waters that are moderately nutrient-rich but not eutrophic. 0?550 m (near Moor House, Westmorland).|Native|The taxonomy of the R. nasturtium-aquaticum aggregate, including diploid R. nasturtium-aquaticum, tetraploid R. microphylla and their triploid hybrid (R. x sterilis), was not elucidated until 1950 and 1951. Records made since then are probably reliable, but the maps in Perring & Sell (1968) were too provisional to allow comparison with the current map.|The world distribution of the two species in this aggregate and their hybrid is given in the following accounts.
Rorippa palustris|A summer-annual, or rarely perennial, herb growing on river banks, on wet mud exposed above receding lake margins, and in ponds that dry out in summer. It is an early colonist of new wetland sites, and there is evidence for longevity of the seed bank. It is an uncommon weed of arable fields, railway cinders, waste ground and gardens. Generally lowland, but reaching 320 m at Buxton (Derbys.).|Native|R. palustris was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that many of the losses shown on the map have occurred since 1950.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Rorippa sylvestris|A perennial herb growing on damp bare ground, often in sites flooded in winter, on the margins and banks of rivers, streams, canals and ditches, by lakes and ponds and in depressions in pastures. It is also a weed of cultivated ground, often in drier situations than in its semi-natural habitats. It is a vigorous pioneer species, intolerant of competition, spreading by seed and by broken pieces of rhizome. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of R. sylvestris is probably stable in semi-natural habitats, but it has become more widespread as a weed since the 1950s. It is now recorded in many more squares than in the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Rosa agrestis|An erect, deciduous shrub of open scrub on dry, calcareous grassland overlying chalk or limestone. Populations often consist of only a few individuals. Lowland.|Native|This species was neglected for many years; recorders have only recently become familiar with it and its distribution is not yet fully documented. It has been lost from some sites due to ploughing, and from others through a reduction in grazing leading to over-shading. However, new sites continue to be found (there were recent records from 16 10-km squares in Britain in Wigginton, 1999), and more doubtless await discovery. In Ireland, its distribution appears to be better known and more stable, but even there it is probably under-recorded.|European Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Rosa arvensis|A deciduous shrub with weak flexuous stems which often climb over other vegetation, often forming dense patches. It grows on a wide variety of soils, but avoids very acidic sites, and is found on woodland edges, in clearings and along rides, on roadsides and railway embankments and in scrub and hedgerows. 0?410 m (Titterstone Clee Hill, Salop).|Native|There is no change in the distribution of R. arvensis since the 1962 Atlas, although it is now much better recorded, especially in Wales, N.W. England and Ireland.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Rosa caesia||||
Rosa canina agg.||||
Rosa canina sens.str.|A deciduous shrub of well-drained calcareous to moderately acidic soils. Habitats include woodland, scrub, hedgerows, cliffs, river banks, rock outcrops, roadsides, railways and waste ground. It can rapidly colonise open, disturbed sites. 0?550 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|This is the most widespread and common segregate of the R. canina aggregate. Four `Groups` within the species were described and mapped by Graham & Primavesi (1993). The distribution of the species is probably stable. The name R. canina is often used for other species and hybrid `Dog-roses`; as many such records have been rejected the true plant is under-recorded in some areas, particularly in Ireland.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Rosa micrantha|A tall, climbing, deciduous shrub, typically found in woodland, scrub and hedgerows, and also more open habitats such as chalk grassland, heathland, sea-cliffs, disused quarries and railway embankments. It grows on a range of well-drained soils, but is most frequent on calcareous substrates and avoids the more acidic sites. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of R. micrantha is now much better known than when it was mapped by Graham & Primavesi (1993). It appears to have declined slightly in some areas, possibly through habitat destruction, but it remains under-recorded.|European Temperate element.
Rosa mollis|An erect, deciduous shrub, suckering freely and sometimes forming dense thickets. It occurs in woodland, hedges, scrub and rough grassland, and on rocky streamsides, rock outcrops, screes, cliffs, sand dunes, waste ground and on roadsides and pathsides. It grows in a variety of well-drained soils, but avoids very acidic conditions. 0?470 m (Pennant Dyfi, Merioneth).|Native|Like R. sherardii, this species is not too difficult to identify and the map is probably a fairly accurate reflection of its true distribution, although it remains under-recorded in some areas, and it is often confused with R. mollis hybrids. Its overall distribution is probably stable.|European Boreo-temperate element.
Rosa mollis agg.||||
Rosa obtusifolia|A low-growing, deciduous shrub with arching stems found along woodland borders and in hedgerows, scrub, rough grassland and road verges, gravel-pits and waste land. It prefers well-drained calcareous to mildly acidic soils. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of this species is probably stable. It is, however, an inconspicuous plant which is certainly under-recorded in many areas. It is also frequently confused with other species and hybrid `Dog-roses`, especially the pubescent form of R. canina and R. x dumetorum.|European Temperate element.
Rosa pimpinellifolia|A low, suckering deciduous shrub most often found on sand dunes and sea-cliffs, but also inland on sandy and less acidic heaths, in scrub and hedgerows on chalk and limestone, and on basic cliff ledges in upland areas. Cultivars grown in gardens sometimes become naturalised. 0?610 m (Glaramara, Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of this species is stable on the coast. It was lost from inland sites before 1930; the habitats at these localities were not well documented but some recent losses have been from heathland. The increase in alien records since the 1962 Atlas has blurred the native range.|Eurasian Temperate element, with a disjunct distribution; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Rosa rubiginosa|An erect deciduous shrub, characteristically found in scrub and hedgerows on chalk and limestone, but also found in quarries, on railway embankments and on waste ground. It is often frequent as a colonist of under-grazed chalk grassland. Lowland.|Native|This species is not difficult to identify and is better recorded than many other Rosa taxa. Some populations have been lost, probably through habitat destruction. However, it is now frequently planted in parks, amenity areas and along new roadsides, and such alien occurrences are increasing.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Rosa rubiginosa agg.||||
Rosa rugosa|A suckering, deciduous shrub found planted or as a garden escape or throw-out in hedgerows and on sand dunes, sea-cliffs, road verges and waste ground; also occurring as a relic of cultivation. It is often well-naturalised, forming large thickets. Lowland.|Neophyte|R. rugosa was introduced into cultivation in 1796, but was not successfully grown until its re-introduction in 1845. It is very common in gardens, parks and amenity plantings, and was first recorded in the wild in 1927 (Cumberland). Its distribution is increasing, but the significant increase in records since it was mapped by Graham & Primavesi (1993) is probably due to better recording.|Native of E. Asia, widely naturalised in N. & C. Europe and has spread around the Baltic by sea-dispersed fruits.     © L. Rooney
Rosa sherardii|An erect, deciduous shrub of woodland edges, hedgerows, scrub, rough grassland, heathland, rock outcrops, cliffs and lane- and track-sides. It grows on a variety of soils and is able to tolerate both moderately acid and wet conditions. Lowland.|Native|This species is not too difficult to identify, and better recorded than many Rosa taxa, although it remains under-recorded in some areas. Its overall distribution is stable, other than in S.E. England where most of the pre-1970 records are based on herbarium specimens.|European Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Rosa stylosa|A deciduous shrub found almost exclusively on well-drained calcareous soils overlying chalk, limestone, clay and sand. It tolerates slightly shaded habitats, and is found in open woodland, hedgerows, disused quarries and scrub. Lowland.|Native|R. stylosa is a frequent species in parts of S.W. England but a rare plant of ancient woods and species-rich hedges at the north-eastern edge of its range, where it may have declined slightly. However, it is probably under-recorded, especially in those areas where it is rare.|European Temperate element.
Rosa tomentosa|A deciduous shrub with arching or climbing stems, which prefers calcareous to mildly acidic soils and is found on woodland edges and in hedgerows, where it appears to thrive in relatively shady conditions, but also in more open habitats including scrub, rough grassland, disused quarries and less acidic heaths. Lowland.|Native|The large proportion of pre-1970 records of this species probably reflects the fact that many records are based on herbarium specimens. Like many Rosa species, R. tomentosa is probably under-recorded. It can be difficult to identify, especially in areas where hybrids with R. canina (R. x scabriuscula) are found.|European Temperate element.
Rubia peregrina|A scrambling, evergreen perennial of hedge banks, scrub, walls, cliffs and other rocky places near the coast, or very locally on calcareous soils further inland. Lowland.|Native|Although geographically restricted, this resilient species can be frequent where it occurs and shows no change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas, although it is now much better recorded along the coast of S. Ireland. Relaxation of grazing on coastal cliff-tops may have led to an increase in available habitat.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © L. Rooney
Rubus arcticus|A herb with a creeping rootstock, from which arise annual stems. In Scotland it grew on mountains, but details of its habitats, associates and altitude are not known. In Finland it grows in damp, open Betula, Pinus or Abies woods, commonly near damp meadows, at fairly low altitudes.|Native|First recorded from Mull in 1768, there are herbarium specimens from a few scattered localities in Scotland, the last dating from 1850. The plant may be sterile in Britain, and it might have been brought here as seeds in the droppings of wintering birds.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.
Rubus caesius|A deciduous shrub of hedges, woodland borders and rides, scrub, dry grassland and semi-stable dunes, mainly on basic soils; also in fen carr. 0-320 m (Alston, Cumberland).|Native|In the past R. caesius has been much confused with forms of R. fruticosus (series Corylifolii), which are sometimes regarded as having originated from hybrids between R. caesius and other microspecies of the R. fruticosus aggregate. The distribution was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There seem to have been declines in the north and west of its range, and in Ireland.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Rubus chamaemorus|A dioecious herb of wet, base-poor peats on moorland and blanket mire, spreading by extensively creeping rhizomes and by seed. Usually above 600 m and reaches at least 1160 m (Beinn a` Bhuird, S. Aberdeen, and Carn Eige, E. Ross), but descends to c. 90 m in Denbighshire.|Native|The overall distribution of R. chamaemorus since the 1962 Atlas is stable, although there have been losses on the edges of its range, particularly in W. Scotland. These losses may be due to drainage, afforestation and moor-burning.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.     © S. Ward
Rubus fruticosus agg.|Deciduous or semi-evergreen shrubs of woods, scrub, banks, hedges, heaths and waste places. They can form dominant stands and although they have a very wide ecological tolerance they reach maximum vigour and diversity on acidic soils. They spread by bird-dispersed seeds, and by tip-rooting stems. 0?490 m (Harwood, Co. Durham).|Native|R. fruticosus is a taxonomically intractable aggregate of over 320 microspecies in Rubus subgenus Rubus (except R. caesius), most of which are facultatively apomictic. There is no change in the distribution of the aggregate since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element.
Rubus idaeus|This shrub is found in open woodland, downland scrub, heathland, and sometimes in hedgerows. It also occurs on rough and waste ground as an escape from cultivation. In the uplands, it grows on the drier ledges of basic crags and ravines, and below base-rich cliffs. It spreads by bird-dispersed fruit, and by suckering, often forming thickets. 0-745 m (Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|R. idaeus has remained widespread, with no change in its distribution. It is very widely cultivated, and it can be difficult to separate native and alien populations.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Rubus saxatilis|A perennial, stoloniferous deciduous herb, usually occurring on basic soils on crags, in ravines and in rocky woodland, occasionally in less acidic rocky heathland and on riverside shingle. 0-975 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|R. saxatilis has been lost from some lowland areas, probably through habitat destruction and changes in woodland management. Many of these losses occurred before 1930, and the distribution is now largely stable. It is rarely frequent, and may be under-recorded in some areas.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element; also in Greenland.     © P. Shannon
Rubus spectabilis|A deciduous, vigorous, suckering shrub, thoroughly naturalised in woods and hedges, often forming large thickets. Whilst most populations arise from plantings, it is also bird-sown. Lowland.|Neophyte|Introduced into cultivation in Britain in 1827, this species is planted in gardens for ornament and as game cover in estate woodland. It was known from the wild by at least 1899 and is probably increasing in some areas.|Native of western N. America.
Rumex acetosa|A tufted, short-lived perennial of neutral to slightly acidic soil in meadows, pastures, woodland rides and glades, mountain ledges and shingle beaches; absent from severely improved grasslands and leys. 0-1215 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas. Four subspecies occur in our area: subsp. acetosa is found throughout the range of the species, subsp. biformis is restricted to sea-cliffs in W. Britain and W. Ireland, subsp. ambiguus is a rare alien in S. England and subsp. hibernicus is mapped separately.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.     © Shannon, P
Rumex acetosella|A rhizomatous perennial herb of dry heaths, non-calcareous sand dunes, shingle beaches and other short, open grasslands on acidic, impoverished, sandy or stony soils. It is sometimes found on outcrops of acidic rocks. 0-1050 m (Carnedd Llewelyn, Caerns.).|Native|There has been little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas. Two subspecies occur in Britain: the widespread subsp. pyrenaicus and the scarcer subsp. acetosella, which replaces it in N. Britain but is not known from Ireland.|Eurosiberian Wide-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-temperate.     © Shannon, P
Rumex aquaticus|An aquatic perennial herb growing on silty and gravelly lake shores, beside ditches and streams, in marshes, wet fields and woodland clearings. Lowland.|Native|There has been no change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas. The species was only discovered in Britain in 1935 and not correctly identified until 1939. It is still holding its own, despite the concern of some conservationists about a high level of introgressive hybridisation with Rumex obtusifolius.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Rumex conglomeratus|A short-lived perennial herb of wet meadows, stream and river banks, ditches, muddy pathsides and field margins and gateways, often in places flooded or waterlogged in winter. 0-420 m (Swindale, Westmorland).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of R. conglomeratus since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.
Rumex crispus|An annual to short-lived perennial herb of waste ground, roadsides, disturbed pastures and arable land; also in a range of coastal habitats including drift-lines, shingle beaches, sand dunes, tidal river banks and the uppermost parts of saltmarshes. 0?845 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|There has been little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas. Three subspecies occur in Britain: subsp. crispus occurs throughout the range of the species and subsp. littoreus and subsp. uliginosus are mapped separately.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Rumex hydrolapathum|A tufted perennial herb found, usually as an emergent, on the margins of slow-flowing rivers and streams, by canals, lakes and ponds, and in ditches. It can also colonise bare ground in marshes and fens, but does not survive in closed vegetation. Lowland.|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of this species in S. England since the 1962 Atlas. However, it has significantly extended its range in N. England, Scotland and Ireland, although some records in these areas may be escapes from sites where it was originally planted for ornament.|European Temperate element.
Rumex longifolius|A perennial herb of open, disturbed ground on roadsides, river banks, streamsides and lake shores, in fields and around farms. 0?520 m (Hartside, Cumberland, and in Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|The map demonstrates that R. longifolius is much more frequent in the Scottish borders than was shown in the 1962 Atlas. It is spreading along roadsides, and new records from England have extended the known distribution south to Cheshire and Staffordshire.|Eurasian Boreal-montane element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Rumex maritimus|An annual to short-lived perennial herb, growing on the margins of pools, lakes, rivers and ditches, in clay-pits and wet hollows in marshy fields. Its sites are usually waterlogged in winter, but it occasionally occurs on dry ground. It can tolerate mildly saline conditions. Lowland.|Native|R. maritimus has been lost from some sites in Britain due to drainage, the loss of ponds and the regulation of water levels. However, there are many more records now than in the 1962 Atlas, and the species spreads readily to new sites; its overall distribution is stable. Increasing eutrophication in Ireland has favoured an expansion there.|Circumpolar Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Rumex obtusifolius|A perennial herb of field margins, hedge banks, roadsides, stream and river banks, ditches and neglected cultivated ground. Mostly lowland, up to 565 m on Dent Crag (Westmorland), but with an exceptional record at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas. It is the commonest species of Rumex in Britain.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Rumex palustris|An annual, biennial or short-lived perennial, typical of wet, nutrient-rich mud exposed in summer and autumn, most often in marshes and beside ponds and ditches, but also in clay- and gravel-pits and on damp disturbed ground. It is also an occasional weed of dry open sites, and has been recorded as a ballast alien. Lowland.|Native|The species declined in Britain, largely before 1930. However, the decrease is less than that of R. maritimus and its distribution is now stable. The apparent increase in Somerset is attributed to better recording rather than a real increase.|European Temperate element.
Rumex pseudoalpinus|A rhizomatous perennial herb found growing near farm buildings, by streams and on roadsides, especially in places manured by animals. Lowland to 375 m at Dowthwaite Head (Cumberland).|Archaeophyte|There is archaeological evidence that R. pseudoalpinus has been present in Scotland since the medieval period. It remains locally common in E. Scotland, but it has declined in the Peak District as farms are converted to non-agricultural residences and tidied up.|Native of the mountains of C. & S. Europe and S.W. Asia.
Rumex pulcher|A biennial or short-lived perennial herb of dry coastal pastures and slightly disturbed grassland on commons, village greens, churchyards and roadsides, mainly on lighter soils and often where the habitat is grazed or trampled. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of R. pulcher since the 1962 Atlas. It is native in S. and E. England and S. Wales but perhaps a long-naturalised introduction in the north. It is alien in Ireland, where it was formerly regarded as a casual but now known to be naturalised at some sites.|European Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Rumex rupestris|A perennial herb of sand and shingle beaches, the base of often unstable sea-cliffs, amongst coastal rocks and in damp dune-slacks; invariably in places where freshwater trickles, or streams debouch, onto the shore. Lowland.|Native|The range of this species has not expanded since the 1962 Atlas, but many new sites have been found and old ones refound in S.W. England. Most populations number only a few individuals, and threats include sea defence works, visitor pressure and winter storms. Three re-introductions have recently been attempted in Devon and Cornwall as part of a recovery plan.|Oceanic Temperate element; restricted to the coast of W. Europe.
Rumex sanguineus|A short-lived perennial herb of woodland margins and rides, hedgerows, roadsides and waste ground. Found on a wide range of soils but favouring damp clay, and usually in more shaded, drier places than R. conglomeratus. Mainly lowland, but reaching 350 m in Glen Shee (Angus) and 380 m in W. Yorkshire.|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, but better recording has shown it to be more frequent within its range.|European Temperate element.
Ruppia cirrhosa|R. cirrhosa is a perennial aquatic which occurs in similar habitats to R. maritima, including coastal lakes, tidal inlets, creeks and brackish ditches. It usually grows in deeper water than R. maritima and tolerates more saline conditions, even growing with Zostera species. Lowland.|Native|R. cirrhosa is now much better recorded than it was for the 1962 Atlas. Most of the losses took place before 1930.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element, but absent from eastern N. America.
Ruppia maritima|A submerged, annual or perennial aquatic of brackish waters, R. maritima grows in shallow water in coastal lakes, pools on saltmarshes, rock pools, creeks and ditches near the sea. It is also found as a dwarf variant on tidal mud-flats, especially in N.E. Scotland. The recent inland record in Cheshire is in an area of natural salt deposits. Lowland.|Native|R. maritima had been lost from many sites before 1930, and this loss has continued in the southern part of its range around coastal developments.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element.
Ruscus aculeatus|A dioecious, evergreen, rhizomatous shrub, found as a native in dry woods and hedgerows, and on cliffs and rocky ground near the sea. It is also naturalised in similar situations, and in churchyards and near habitation. It reproduces vegetatively by creeping rhizomes, and by seed, which may be bird-sown. Lowland.|Native|R. aculeatus is frequently grown in gardens, and may become established where discarded or deliberately planted, or where bird-sown. The overall distribution is stable since the 1962 Atlas, but the line between native and alien occurrences is becoming increasingly blurred and it is probably much planted within the mapped native range.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Sagina apetala|An annual of open situations, predominately in artificial habitats but also in gravelly and sandy places. 0-425 m (Grinton, N.W. Yorks.).|Native|The map shows little change from those of the two component subspecies which were mapped in the 1962 Atlas. Comparison of this map with the following maps of the subspecies shows that recorders have only unevenly distinguished between them.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Sagina maritima|An annual of maritime rock crevices, cliff-tops, stabilised shingle, dune-slacks and disturbed areas in upper saltmarsh on sandy substrates; also on walls and tracks, in pavements and on sandy roadsides near the sea. A form of it, described as var. alpina, has been recorded at 1210 m on Ben Nevis (Westerness), though the identity of such plants requires confirmation.|Native|There has been little significant change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, although it appears to have declined or has possibly been overlooked recently in N.W. Scotland. It has recently been recorded from inland squares beside salt-treated roads.|European Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Sagina nivalis|This cushion-forming, perennial herb usually occurs in open, unstable habitats with little vascular plant cover, generally growing on soft calcareous schist. It is found in both dry and damp conditions, often growing through a bryophyte mat on a rock face or on gravelly ground. Its wetter sites are subject to periodic flushing. Between 840 m on Meall nan Tarmachan and 1190 m on Ben Lawers (both Mid Perth).|Native|Though losses occur from rock falls and erosion, new colonies establish on the exposed soil, and its range and distribution is likely to be more or less stable.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.
Sagina nodosa|S. nodosa is a plant of damp habitats, principally in mires and springs irrigated with base-rich water, but also in open, calcareous, sandy habitats, especially dunes and dune-slacks and sometimes in drier calcareous grassland. Generally lowland, but reaching 850 m on Glas Moel (Angus).|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There has been a widespread decline in S. England, and analysis of the database reveals that this has occurred since 1950. This reflects the loss of open, calcareous habitats.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.     © L. Rooney
Sagina procumbens|Natural habitats of this mat-forming perennial include rocks, cliffs and river-banks, but it also grows in a wide variety of artificial, disturbed and fertile habitats, including spoil heaps, mining waste, paths, roadside verges and urban pavements. It is a common weed of horticulture, especially in lawns, and is a particular nuisance in pots. The plant is tolerant of a wide range of soils and can stand heavy trampling. 0-1150 m (E. Scottish Highlands).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Sagina saginoides|A tufted, perennial herb which usually grows on base-rich, well-drained soils. It is a poor competitor, occurring on steep ground, in areas of late snow-lie and areas of severe wind-scour which provide the open conditions it requires. Generally between 700 and 900 m, but reaching 1190 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth), and descending to 460 m on the Old Man of Storr, Skye (N. Ebudes).|Native|There does not appear to be any significant change since the 1962 Atlas. The lack of recent records in some squares may only be due to under-recording.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Sagina subulata|A perennial, mat-forming herb usually of dry, open, sandy or gravelly places. Habitats include heaths, dry pastures, banks and rocks, grassy slopes near the sea, and especially trackways through heaths and moors. It also occurs on basaltic gravel terraces on the Trotternish Mountains (Skye), accompanying Koenigia islandica. 0-700 m (Mt Brandon, S. Kerry), and reportedly to 835 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|Many inland sites had been lost before 1930 and, whilst there have been further losses, especially in W. Ireland, there is little evidence of decline in coastal areas.|European Temperate element.
Sagittaria sagittifolia|A perennial herb of shallow, still or slowly flowing, calcareous and eutrophic water. In major rivers it may be present only as submerged leaves, but in ditches, lakes, ponds and canals it often produces emergent leaves and flowers. It perennates as tubers produced on stolons in the leaf axils. Lowland.|Native|The overall British range of S. sagittifolia is stable, though in some areas the plant has been lost from ditches and is now restricted to larger rivers (Tarpey & Heath, 1990). In Ireland it is now better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas, and has spread through canals. It rarely colonises new habitats, but is sometimes deliberately introduced to ponds.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.
Salicornia|These annuals grow in a variety of coastal habitats, including saltmarshes, sand, muddy shingle, creeks and brackish fields behind sea-walls. Lowland.|Native|The genus Salicornia is acknowledged to be very difficult taxonomically. Live material is essential for serious study, and it has proved hard to obtain a taxonomical or nomenclatural consensus between different authorities in the British Isles or in N.W. Europe. The following species maps must be regarded as provisional.|The genus has an almost cosmopolitan distribution; the world distributions of the species are given in the accounts below.
Salicornia dolichostachya|An annual of open mud and muddy sand on intertidal flats and in the lowest parts of saltmarshes, and occasionally in the mid-marsh along the banks of saltmarsh creeks and runnels. Lowland.|Native|S. dolichostachya was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas and there is no reliable information on trends in its distribution. It is almost certainly under-recorded, being overlooked or else dismissed, along with other glassworts, as `Salicornia agg`.|European Boreo-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Salicornia europaea|An annual found at all levels of sandy or muddy saltmarshes, in saltmarsh-sand dune transitions and wet, tidally inundated dune-slacks; also, more rarely, in relict saltmarsh and other open saline areas behind sea-walls. Halliday (1997) notes that in Cumbria S. europaea is probably the only Salicornia species able to persist on grazed marshes. Lowland.|Native|This taxon was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas and there is no reliable information on trends in its distribution. It is uncertain whether S. europaea has been under- or over-recorded, and in the past it has been confused with S. ramosissima.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element.

It is almost certainly under-recorded, and perhaps also mis-identified as S. dolichostachya which occurs in similar habitats. Some authorities consider that it is a variety of the latter species (Rich & Jermy, 1998).|Oceanic Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Salicornia nitens|An annual which, in contrast to other members of the S. procumbens group (S. dolichostachya, S. fragilis), occurs mainly in the middle and upper parts of saltmarshes, especially in bare mud associated with salt-pans and high-level runnels. Lowland.|Native|S. nitens was described as a new species by Ball & Tutin (1959), but was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas. There is no reliable information on trends in its distribution, though it is known to have been lost from several sites in S. England due to saltmarsh reclamation. It is almost certainly under-recorded.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element; its European distribution is incompletely understood because of taxonomic uncertainties.     © L. Rooney
Salicornia obscura|An annual of bare damp mud in saltmarsh pans, creeks and runnels. Brewis et al. (1996) report that, in Hampshire, S. obscura prefers the sloping sides of upper salt-marsh creeks. Lowland.|Native|This taxon, described as a new species by Ball & Tutin (1959), was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas. S. obscura has been lost from some sites, including the type locality on Hayling Island (Brewis et al., 1996), due to agricultural land-claim and other coastal developments. It is almost certainly under-recorded, with some populations probably being mis-identified or overlooked as S. europaea.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Salicornia procumbens agg.||||
Salicornia pusilla|An annual restricted to the uppermost parts of saltmarshes, growing on firm mud or sand in salt-pans and on the drift-line; also behind sea-walls in areas subject to saltwater seepage and kept open by vehicles or livestock. Lowland.|Native|The increase in records since the 1962 Atlas is due to more comprehensive recording. In parts of S.E. England (e.g. Hampshire), habitat loss, either through successional changes (e.g. spread of Spartina anglica) or agricultural land-claim, may have been an important factor in the demise of some populations.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Salicornia ramosissima|This morphologically highly variable annual is usually found in the middle and upper zones of saltmarshes, in closed Puccinellia maritima swards, salt-pans, creeks and drift-lines. It also occurs on firm sand and muddy shingle, and behind sea-walls in open areas of brackish grazing marsh. Ball & Tutin (1959) note that this species occurs `in all parts of saltmarshes except the lower mud-flats`. Lowland.|Native|S. ramosissima was not mapped in the 1962 Atlas and there is no reliable information on trends in its distribution. There is much confusion between this species and S. europaea.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Salix alba|A conspicuous tree which grows in marshes and wet hollows and by ponds, ditches, streams and rivers. 0?350 m (S. of Alston, Cumberland).|Archaeophyte|This species has been much planted, sometimes as distinct cultivars. It may have decreased in Ireland, but has not significantly changed in Britain.

Salix arbuscula|A low shrub of base-rich substrates on mountains, occurring in moist or wet habitats, mostly in flushes, on gravelly soil near burns and on damp ledges of calcareous rock. From 460 m (Ben Lui, Mid Perth) to 870 m (Carn Gorm in Glen Lyon, Mid Perth) but rarely below 600 m.|Native|This species may be more tolerant of grazing than most other montane Salix. The distribution has not significantly changed since the 1962 Atlas, but some new sites have been discovered. It was lost from two of the squares in S. Scotland before 1930.|European Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.
Salix aurita|A much-branched shrub which grows on acidic soils on heathland and moorland, in scrub, by watercourses and on rocky streamsides and hills. 0?790 m (Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|This species is frequent or abundant in suitable habitats through much of its range. There have been losses in S.E. England, some of them since 1930. The acidic habitats it favours have been lost to drainage and agricultural improvement. In some areas, the hybrid S. x multinervis persists in the absence of S. aurita.|European Boreo-temperate element.
Salix caprea|A shrub or tree which grows in open woodland and wood margins, scrub and hedgerows, and around rocky lake and streamsides. It colonises waste ground and can tolerate drier and more base-rich soils than S. cinerea. 0?760 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|The range of this species is similar to that in the 1962 Atlas, but local increases in abundance have been noted in England along disused railways. It may have been over-recorded for S. x reichardtii or large-leaved forms of S. cinerea. Subsp. caprea occurs throughout the range of the species; subsp. sphacelata is mapped separately.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Salix cinerea|A shrub or small tree which grows in wet places, including woods, marshes and fens, by streams and bogs, and as a colonist of damp places on waste ground and in disused mineral workings. Generally lowland, with an exceptional record at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|This species may be increasing, especially in England and S. Ireland, but it is so frequent that this is barely obvious at the 10-km scale. There are two subspecies in the British Isles, both of which are mapped separately.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.
Salix fragilis|A broad-crowned, often pollarded, tree which grows in hedgerows, marshes, fens, wet woods and hollows, and by ponds, ditches, streams and rivers. It can tolerate a polluted atmosphere and salt-laden winds. 0?410 m (Allendale, S. Northumb.).|Archaeophyte|This species has often been planted, sometimes as distinct unisexual varieties. The distribution is little changed since the 1962 Atlas.|As an archaeophyte S. fragilis has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range. Many of the variants regarded as S. fragilis in Britain and Ireland would be regarded as S. x rubens by bota
Salix herbacea|A dwarf shrub of open, often bryophyte-rich communities in areas of late snow-lie, or in conditions of extreme exposure. It grows on erosion surfaces or stony ground on windswept ridges and cols, on screes, in corries and hollows, and locally on ledges and in montane grass-heath. From near sea-level (Fethaland, Shetland) to 1310 m (Ben Nevis, Westerness), but mostly not below 600 m.|Native|Populations in England appear to be in decline (Halliday, 1997), and many sites in Ireland were lost before 1930. There has been no significant overall change in Scotland, and populations in Wales are stable.|European Arctic-montane element; also in N. America.     © Maria Alvarez and Xander van der Burgt
Salix lanata|A low shrub of damp base-rich mountain rock ledges and crags in N.-facing corries, often in areas where snow lies late. It is usually on calcareous schist and rarely on limestone. From 620 m to 1035 m (Geal Charn, Westerness).|Native|This species is now known from more 10-km squares than were mapped in the 1962 Atlas. However, numbers have declined due to increasing grazing pressure by deer and sheep. Some populations have been reduced to single plants, and others lost altogether. Fencing is being tried to arrest the decline at some sites.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.
Salix lapponum|A low shrub of moist or wet, moderately base-enriched sites on rocky mountain slopes and cliffs. This species tolerates a wider range of soil conditions than most montane Salix, but is now largely confined to cliffs. From 210 m (Ochil Hills, W. Perth) to 1000 m (Aonach Beag, Westerness).|Native|Trends in the distribution of this species are unclear. Some small, ungrazed colonies appear to be producing no or very few seedlings, and may be in decline. Further work will be needed to establish whether it has been lost from all the 10-km squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|Eurosiberian Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Salix myrsinifolia|A shrub, or less often a small tree, which grows mainly on rocks or on gravelly river-banks and lake shores, less frequently in thickets on marshy ground or by wet woodland margins. In Scotland it sometimes grows in wet dune-slacks and as a dwarf, spreading shrub on wet rock ledges. Generally lowland, but reaching 940 m on Stob Binnein (Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no significant change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, but it is now much better recorded. It does, however, closely resemble S. phylicifolia and their hybrid, and some mapped records may be erroneous.|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element.
Salix myrsinites|A low, spreading shrub which grows mainly in moist or wet, base-enriched sites on mountains. It is restricted to ungrazed or lightly grazed areas. From 180 m (Inchnadamph, W. Sutherland) to 915 m (Ben Alder and Aonach Beag, Westerness).|Native|Data are insufficient to show current trends, but like S. lapponum, isolated colonies of this species are possibly declining. Its procumbent habit may, however, allow it to escape grazing at some sites.|European Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.
Salix pentandra|A large shrub or small tree which grows in damp or wet ground, mostly in marshes, fens and wet woods, in winter-flooded dune-slacks and by ponds and streams; sometimes in drier sites such as shaded roadsides. Male plants are widely planted as ornamentals within and outside the native range. 0-410 m (Allendale, S. Northumb.).|Native|The distribution of S. pentandra has not significantly changed since the 1962 Atlas. Delimination of the southern limit of its native range is difficult, although the absence of female plants in a population can indicate non-native status.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Salix phylicifolia|A much-branched shrub or small tree which grows by ponds, streams and rivers, and in damp rocky places, preferring base-rich soils and sometimes associated with Carboniferous limestone. In Ireland it is a montane species. From near sea-level to 685 m at Catstycam (Westmorland).|Native|Although now much better recorded, the distribution of this species has not changed significantly since the 1962 Atlas. It is very similar to S. myrsinifolia, and may be mis-identified for it and the hybrid between them.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Salix purpurea|A variable shrub or small tree found on wet ground, at wood margins, on damp hillsides, by streams and rivers, on river shingle, in marshes and fens, and sometimes planted as an osier. 0?440 m (E. Allendale, S. Northumb.).|Native|This species has been much planted for basketry. Native and alien occurrences are now so confused that all records are mapped as if they are native. Its distribution has not significantly changed since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Salix repens|A variable shrub growing in a range of habitats. The prostrate var. argentea and var. repens are typically found on fixed dunes and especially dune-slacks, in maritime heaths and heathy grassland and on inland heaths and moorland. The erect var. fusca is found in fens. The species becomes more confined to moist or wet habitats in the south and east of its range. 0-855 m (Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|The species has declined, especially inland in England, but since it was mapped in the 1962 Atlas as `all records` it is difficult to know when these losses occurred.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Salix reticulata|A creeping dwarf shrub which grows on base-rich montane rock ledges of limestone or calcareous schist. From 650 m (Creag Mhor, Mid Perth) to 1125 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth), but rarely found at the lower end of this range.|Native|Although lost from several 10-km squares before 1930, the overall distribution of this species now appears to be stable. Local populations, however, may fluctuate in numbers.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.     © Pete Stroh

Salsola kali||||
Salvia pratensis|A long-lived perennial herb of unimproved grassland, lane-sides, road verges and disturbed ground on well-drained soils overlying chalk and limestone. It is occasionally established from gardens or as a casual in waste places. Lowland.|Native|S. pratensis was not recorded from the wild until 1699, but was known to Elizabethan gardeners, and its native status has often been questioned. Most of the losses of native sites seem to have taken place before 1950, and there is little evidence for a significant decline in recent years. Introductions also appear to be decreasing.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Salvia verbenaca|An aromatic perennial herb of open grassland on sunny banks, sand dunes and roadsides; usually on well-drained, base-rich soils, including sticky calcareous clays that are wet in winter and baked dry in summer. In S.E. England, it is often associated with churchyards because of the medieval practice of sowing it on graves (Sturt, 1995). In Ireland, it is almost exclusively coastal. Lowland.|Native|The decline of S. verbenaca was already apparent in the 1962 Atlas and it has continued, particularly inland and in the north of its range. Most losses are probably due to changes in land use.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS

Sambucus nigra|A deciduous shrub or small tree of fertile soils in a wide range of habitats including woodland, hedgerows, grassland, scrub, waste ground, roadsides and railway banks. It is resistant to rabbit grazing and often occurs around warrens. 0-470 m (above Nenthead, Cumberland).|Native|The current range of S. nigra is similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas. It may have been originally introduced at some sites, but it is often impossible to distinguish native and alien occurrences, especially as it has often spread naturally by bird-sown seeds. In N.

Sambucus racemosa|A deciduous shrub established in woodland, shrubberies, hedges and waste ground, and planted as game cover in parts of N. England and Scotland. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was introduced in the 16th century and is quite widely cultivated. Dunn (1905) described it as `occasionally noticed as a semi-wild plant near gardens and shrubberies`. Most of its spread as a garden escape took place in the 20th century, with much consolidation since the 1962 Atlas.|A very variable Circumpolar Boreo-temperate species, comprising several subspecies. It is absent as a native from much of N. & W. Europe.
Samolus valerandi|A deciduous short-lived perennial found in small colonies by permanently wet and often seasonally flooded springs, flushed sea-cliffs, puddles, ditches, lagoons and lake shores. It is limited to very open mesic, often calcareous or somewhat saline soils. Populations are often impermanent, colonising the small and transient specialised habitats which change as spring lines and water levels shift. Individuals are usually monocarpic, but may take several years to flower. Lowland.|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that most of the losses, which tend to be inland and may result from drainage, have taken place since 1950.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element.
Sanguisorba minor||||
Sanguisorba officinalis|A perennial herb of neutral grassland, occurring on alluvial or peaty soils in damp or dry, unimproved pastures, hay meadows and marshy meadows, on river banks and lake shores and in base-enriched flushes on grassy heaths. 0-460 m near Cauldron Snout, Teesdale (Westmorland).|Native|Whilst the range of S. officinalis remains the same as in the 1962 Atlas, losses have occurred through the improvement of pastures.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element, but absent as a native from eastern N. America; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Sanicula europaea|A perennial herb of moist soil in deciduous woodland, often where Fagus, Fraxinus or Quercus spp. predominate; also locally in substantial hedge banks and shaded roadsides. In the north and west of its range it is sometimes found in relict woodland in gorges and in sheltered stream ravines. The substrate is usually calcareous or otherwise base-rich, but can occasionally be neutral or mildly acidic. Generally lowland, but reaching 500 m above Malham (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|In some areas there has been some decline in the frequency of this species, which was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Saponaria officinalis|This rhizomatous perennial herb is found in a wide range of man-made and marginal habitats, often near habitation, including hedge banks, quarries, roadsides, railway banks, tips and waste ground. It is thoroughly naturalised by streams and in damp woods, especially in S.W. England and N. Wales, where it has sometimes been considered native. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|This species has long been grown in gardens, and readily establishes from outcast plants.

Sarcocornia perennis|A woody perennial subshrub of saltmarshes, especially in bare or sparsely vegetated areas on firm, muddy sand and gravel. S. perennis occurs on eroding lower parts of saltmarshes, at higher elevations on saltmarsh drift-lines and on shell and shingle banks; sometimes also on bare ground behind sea-walls. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas. At many localities S. perennis is found in small and fragmentary stands or as just a few widely scattered bushes, suggesting that it could still be present but undetected in some of the squares for which there are only old records.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © L. Rooney
Saussurea alpina|A perennial herb of damp, base-rich cliffs, screes and other open ground, occasionally found in flushed areas and sometimes washed down mountain streams to become established on rocky stream banks and riverside shingle. It reproduces by seed, and spreads vegetatively by new rosettes arising from stolons. From near sea level in Caithness to 1170 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|Though the map of S. alpina shows no discernible change since the 1962 Atlas, there is evidence of local declines since the 1950s in the Lake District (Halliday, 1997) and on Irish mountains (Curtis & McGough, 1988).|Eurasian Arctic-montane element.     © Pete Stroh
Saxifraga aizoides|A perennial herb usually found by the side of mountain streams, in open stony flushes on gently- or steeply-sloping ground, or sprawling over wet rocks; less commonly, on wet screes and sand dunes. It may rapidly colonise disturbed soil, such as newly dug cuttings on forestry tracks, in the vicinity of natural habitats. Whilst not strictly a calcicole, it avoids the most base-poor substrates. 0-1175 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of S. aizoides since the 1962 Atlas.|European Arctic-montane element; also in N. America.
Saxifraga cernua|A perennial, bulbiliferous herb of basic rocks. It grows in crevices and beneath overhangs where exposure is limited and humidity is high, usually in sites with late snow-lie. S. cernua flowers only infrequently, and, apparently, seed is not set in Britain; vegetative reproduction is by axillary bulbils. From 920 m (Bidean nam Bian, Main Argyll) to 1170 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|Although additional populations of S. cernua have been discovered since the 1962 Atlas, there has been no change in the number of 10-km squares in which it occurs.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Saxifraga cespitosa|A cushion-forming, perennial herb of well-drained base-rich rocks. It is found on mossy ledges, in crevices and on boulder-scree slopes. It appears to be highly susceptible to drought. From 520 m (Cwm Idwal, Caerns.) to 1180 m (Ben Nevis, Westerness).|Native|There has been a slight decline since the 1962 Atlas, especially in the Cairngorms. A re-stocking programme at the Welsh site, begun in 1978 and using local seed, appears to have been largely successful, notwithstanding considerable fluctuations in population size.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C. Europe.
Saxifraga granulata|A perennial herb with a bulbiliferous rhizome, growing in moist but well-drained, often lightly grazed, base-rich and neutral grassland, in unimproved pastures and hay meadows, and on grassy banks. More rarely, it occurs on shaded river banks and in damp woodland. It is also locally naturalised near houses and in churchyards. Generally lowland, but reaching 580 m N.E. of Helbeck Fell (Westmorland).|Native|S. granulata has been lost from many sites in S. England since the 1962 Atlas, as grasslands have been improved. Naturalised populations include a double-flowered cultivar.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Saxifraga hirculus|A stoloniferous perennial herb found in wet, base-rich flushes and mires, especially where the vegetation is checked by grazing. Formerly near sea level, it survives now only in its upland localities usually at 300-650 m, but reaching 750 m (Mickle Fell, N.W. Yorks.).|Native|The 1962 Atlas showed a decline up to about 1930, with lowland populations (mostly in Scotland) disappearing owing to afforestation, drainage and other demands of agriculture. Since then, however, there has been only a slight reduction in the number of 10-km squares.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Saxifraga hirsuta|A perennial, stoloniferous herb, found growing only in damp, shaded places, such as woods, N.-facing cliffs and banks, and by streams and on rocks in the mountains. Naturalised populations in Britain, often derived from garden escapes, are often found on limestone, whereas in its native Ireland the species occurs only on siliceous rock. 0?915 m (Mt Brandon, S. Kerry).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the native range of S. hirsuta since the 1962 Atlas, although naturalised populations in Britain have increased considerably, especially in the north and west.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Saxifraga hypnoides|A perennial, stoloniferous herb growing on moist rocks, screes, cliffs and by mountain streams, rarely on sand dunes, often in partial shade. Substrates are frequently base-rich, although it can grow on acidic rocks. It is also cultivated and sometimes escapes. 0-1215 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth), but generally from 200-760 m.|Native|The distribution of S. hypnoides is generally similar to that in the 1962 Atlas, although it may have declined in N.

Saxifraga nivalis|A perennial, rhizomatous herb growing on damp, shady, base-rich rocks and cliffs. It is usually found in crevices and on ledges where competing vegetation does not overtop it. From 365 m at Quiraing (N. Ebudes) to 1210 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth), with unlocalised records at 1300 m in the Cairngorms.|Native|The distribution of S. nivalis has remained stable since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.
Saxifraga oppositifolia|A prostrate to more or less densely caespitose perennial herb, growing on open, moist but well-drained, base-rich rocks and stony ground, mainly on cliff-faces, ledges, stony flushes and scree slopes, the southern sites having a northerly aspect. From near sea level to 1210 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth), but usually between 300 and 1000 m.|Native|The distribution of S. oppositifolia is stable. There is little evidence to support the formal taxonomic recognition of prostrate as opposed to caespitose ecotypes.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Saxifraga rivularis|A perennial, bulbiliferous and stoloniferous herb of basic rocks. S. rivularis grows on ledges or under overhangs, in damp, steep, N.- to E.-facing gullies, or more rarely in bryophyte-rich flushes on exposed scree. From 795 m in the Lairig Ghru (Easterness) to 1200 m on Ben Nevis (Westerness).|Native|The distribution of S. rivularis has been stable since the 1962 Atlas, though a few old records have been confirmed relatively recently.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element; absent from mountains of C.

Saxifraga rosacea||||
Saxifraga spathularis|A perennial, stoloniferous herb usually found in acid conditions in areas of high rainfall (exceeding one metre per year over much of its range), where it grows in humid, rocky woods, on shady mountain cliffs and relatively unshaded S.-facing slopes. 0?1040 m on Carrantuohill (S. Kerry).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of S. spathularis since the 1962 Atlas.|Oceanic Temperate element; restricted as a native to N. Portugal, N.W. Spain and Ireland.
Saxifraga stellaris|A perennial, stoloniferous herb found in open (rarely shaded), wet flushes, growing by mountain streams or on wet rock ledges and cliff-faces, usually in base-poor soil. It is commonly found from about 200-1000 m, although it has been recorded at 1340 m on the top of Ben Nevis (Westerness).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of S. stellaris since the 1962 Atlas.|European Arctic-montane element; also in N. America.
Saxifraga tridactylites|A winter-annual that occurs in dry, open habitats such as sandy grassland, limestone pavement and rock ledges, cliffs and screes, and on man-made structures like mortared walls, pavements and railway tracks. It is most commonly found on base-rich substrates, often on skeletal soils or virtually bare rock. Usually lowland, but ascending to 595 m on Widdale Fell (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|S. tridactylites was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It is now much better recorded but there has been a widespread decline in S. and E. England.

Scabiosa columbaria|A perennial herb, usually found on dry, relatively infertile soils. Habitats include calcareous pastures on downs, hill-slopes and banks, and it is occasionally found on cliffs and rock outcrops and in disused chalk and limestone quarries. Generally lowland, reaching 640 m on Cross Fell (Cumberland).|Native|Very few losses of S. columbaria were evident in the 1962 Atlas. Since then, however, it has declined throughout its range, but particularly outside its core areas, due to the loss of permanent grassland and a lack of grazing leading to coarser swards.|European Temperate element.
Scandix pecten-veneris|An annual of arable fields, particularly on calcareous clay soils; occasionally on paths and banks beside current or former arable sites, and rarely on waste ground, coastal cliffs, and in gardens. Generally lowland, reaching 320 m in Teesdale (Co. Durham).|Archaeophyte|This species has decreased very greatly since 1950 as a result of modern agricultural methods, especially herbicide treatments. It now appears to be extinct in Ireland, but is still occasionally seen in large numbers in East Anglia.|As an archaeophyte S. pecten-veneris has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; it is widely naturalised outside this range.

Scheuchzeria palustris|A rhizomatous perennial herb of base-poor, wet habitats, typically found in acid runnels, pools or semi-submerged Sphagnum lawns at pool edges. Formerly also lowland, its extant sites on Rannoch Moor are at c. 300 m (Mid Perth and Main Argyll).|Native|All English sites for S. palustris were lost before 1900 due to drainage and eutrophication. The distribution in Scotland is stable; new sites have been found on Rannoch Moor recently due to detailed recording. It was discovered in Co. Offaly in 1951, but the original site was lost to peat extraction by 1960, and a nearby transplant did not survive.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Schoenoplectus lacustris|A tall rhizomatous perennial herb of standing or flowing fresh water, in conditions ranging from eutrophic and base-rich to oligotrophic and base-poor. Substrates include silt, clay, peat or gravel. It occurs in ponds, lakes, canals, dykes and slow moving rivers, usually in water 0.3-1.5 m deep, but can also be found in deeper water. Generally lowland, but reaching 405 m at Dock Tarn (Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of S. lacustris is very similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`, but there have been local losses in S.E.

Schoenoplectus pungens|This rhizomatous perennial was formerly known from the margin of a coastal lake in Jersey, and from a wet, coastal dune-slack near Ainsdale (S. Lancs.). Lowland.|Native|or alien. S. pungens was first recorded in our area in 1724. It declined in Jersey, where it is possibly native, during the 1940s and 1950s; it was last seen there in the early 1970s, apparently having been replaced by Carex riparia. It was first collected at Ainsdale in 1909, and in 1928 a large patch occurred in a dune-slack. Its origin there is obscure and it became extinct by 1978. Ainsdale stock survived in cultivation, however, and has been planted at several sites nearby.|European Temperate element; widespread in N. America.
Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani|A rhizomatous perennial herb, most frequent in coastal sites where it grows in brackish water in rivers, dykes, tidal channels, lagoons and dune-slacks; also in depressions in saltmarsh and in wet pasture. Inland, it occurs by lakes, ponds, slow-flowing rivers, streams and canals, and in flooded quarries and pits. Lowland.|Native|The map indicates a marked increase in inland sites for this species since the 1962 Atlas. This might, in part, be due to better recording now that its ability to grow inland is appreciated. It has also colonised newly created gravel-pits, and may have been planted at some of its inland sites.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element.
Schoenoplectus triqueter|This tussock-forming, rhizomatous perennial herb occurs on mud-banks along the lower reaches of tidal rivers, where it may become submerged at the highest tides. Lowland.|Native|Populations of S. triqueter have been lost to land reclamation and as a result of bank construction. The surviving population on the River Tamar (S. Devon) is now extremely small, although the hybrid with S. tabernaemontani is more frequent there. S. triqueter is still present in Ireland by the River Shannon (Co. Limerick) and its tributaries, where populations are larger than in Britain but some are threatened by development.|Eurasian Temperate element.
Schoenus ferrugineus|A tussock-forming perennial occurring in base-rich flushes within calcareous grassland, usually adjacent to unimproved heathland. Seed production is low, and dispersal is restricted as the seed is retained in the inflorescence for up to a year. From 200 m above Loch Tummel (Mid Perth) to 390 m as an alien on Ben Vrackie (E. Perth).|Native|S. ferrugineus was thought to have become extinct in Scotland when the water-levels were raised at its only known site, Loch Tummel, in 1950. At least one transplant from here survived, however, and since 1970 ten new sites have been discovered. All have some form of statutory protection.|European Boreal-montane element.
Schoenus nigricans|A tussock-forming perennial of calcareous and other base-rich fens (especially near springs), and of peaty flushes, marshes, bogs, dune-slacks, sea-cliff flushes, and the upper fringes of saltmarshes where there is base-rich flushing. In W. Ireland, it is frequent on acid blanket-bog. Generally lowland, but reaching 550 m in the Mourne Mountains (Co. Down).|Native|S. nigricans had widely declined in lowland sites before 1930, and this loss has continued outside its core areas. Its distribution is stable near the western coasts of Britain and in Ireland.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; also in N. America.
Scilla autumnalis|A bulbous perennial herb of open, drought-prone grasslands and heathy vegetation in rocky or sandy places near the sea; also on terrace gravels in the lower Thames valley. Lowland.|Native|There were some losses of this species before 1930, but there is little evidence of significant change in distribution or abundance since the 1962 Atlas. S. autumnalis is tetraploid almost throughout its British range, the exception being on the S. coast of Cornwall and on Guernsey where a hexaploid race occurs.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Scilla verna|A bulbous perennial herb of short turf and maritime heath on exposed cliff-tops and on rocky slopes near the sea, sometimes within the zone regularly affected by sea-water spray. In areas with a pronounced oceanic climate (e.g. Anglesey) it can occur on heathland well inland. Generally lowland, but reaching 415 m in Foula (Shetland).|Native|There is no evidence of any significant change in the distribution of S. verna since the 1962 Atlas. Within its highly restricted habitat S. verna is often present in large numbers, and its sites are usually too exposed for any major threat from successional or land-use change.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Scirpoides holoschoenus|In Devon, this rhizomatous perennial herb occurs in damp dune-slacks and on adjacent low dunes, and in Somerset in a damp sandy hollow on a coastal golf course. Elsewhere, it occurs as an alien, especially in industrial areas. Substantial ripening of fruit and seed set appear to occur only after a long, hot summer. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of this species is stable, though native populations are at risk from scrub encroachment, which requires careful management, and hydrological changes.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element.
Scirpus sylvaticus|A robust rhizomatous perennial herb which may form extensive stands in swampy valley woodlands and similar shady places; also in wet pastures bordering woods and streams, and on the margins of rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. It typically grows over thick, rather eutrophic silts which are often iron-enriched (Rodwell, 1991a). Lowland, reaching 300 m at Clearburn Loch (Selkirks.).|Native|There have been local losses of S. sylvaticus in S.E. England. It is, however, much better recorded since the 1962 Atlas, especially in N. England, Scotland and N. Ireland.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Scleranthus annuus|An annual or biennial herb found in soil pockets on summer-droughted rocks, and on disturbed sandy soil on heaths, commons, waste places, arable fields and, rarely, river or maritime shingle. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m in Aberdeenshire.|Native|S. annuus was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined significantly throughout its range and analysis of the database shows that most losses have occurred since 1950. Subsp. annuus occurs throughout the range of the species, subsp. polycarpos is mapped separately.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Scleranthus perennis||||
Scorzonera humilis|A perennial herb of damp, unimproved grasslands and fen-meadows on relatively infertile, neutral or mildly acidic soils. Lowland.|Native|or alien. This species was first recorded in Britain at one site in Dorset in 1914. That site still supports a large population, though the field is now very overgrown. It was recorded once at another site in Dorset, in 1927. The small Warwickshire population, discovered in 1954, had gone by 1967. The two Glamorgan sites were discovered in 1996 and 1997. The native status of this species is sometimes questioned, but as its habitats are similar to those in continental Europe, most authorities accept it as native in Britain.|European Temperate element.
Scrophularia auriculata|A perennial herb of wet places on the margins of lakes, rivers, streams and canals, and in ditches, marshes and wet woodlands. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of S. auriculata is broadly similar to that in the 1962 Atlas. There are rather more records at the northern edge of its contiguous range, probably because of more thorough recording in previously under-worked areas. Many records from N. Scotland have been discounted as errors for S. nodosa.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © Shannon, P
Scrophularia nodosa|A perennial herb of open or shaded habitats, preferring fertile soils and found in damp woodland, woodland rides, hedge banks, ditches and riversides, and sometimes in drier sites on waste ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 480 m at Angle Tarn, Patterdale (Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of S. nodosa is stable.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Scrophularia scorodonia|A long-lived perennial herb of hedge banks, scrubby field-borders, rough ground on cliff-tops, waste places, disused quarries and old walls. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. scorodonia has been known in Jersey since 1689 and in Cornwall since 1712. As the mainland sites are almost entirely near ports and its habitats are ruderal, it may have been accidentally introduced. It is unclear whether the increase in recent records since the 1962 Atlas indicates a real extension of range, or merely better recording, although even within its core areas it appears to be increasing.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Scrophularia umbrosa|A rhizomatous perennial herb which grows on fertile soils by streams and rivers, and in damp woodland, in both open and shaded places. Generally lowland.|Native|Although S. umbrosa is treated as a native species it may be a relatively recent colonist. It was first recorded in Britain in 1840 (Salop) and in Ireland in 1895 (Co. Dublin). It was first recorded relatively recently in counties such as Berwickshire (1852), Norfolk (1904), Angus (1910) and Cumbria (1924), and it has a puzzlingly patchy distribution. It continues to increase, especially within its current strongholds.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Scrophularia vernalis|A biennial, sometimes perennial, herb found in woodland clearings, plantations, hedge banks and rough waste ground, usually in shade. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was first recorded in the wild in 1633. By the 18th century it was known from several localities in, for example, Surrey, Sussex and N. Wales, and it had become naturalised throughout Britain by 1930. The number of records has increased since the 1962 Atlas, particularly in S.E. Scotland.|Native of the mountains of C. & S. Europe and the Caucasus.
Scutellaria galericulata|A perennial herb associated with a variety of wetland habitats including ponds, rivers, canals, marshes, fens, fen-meadows, wet woodland and dune-slacks. It also grows on coastal boulder beaches in Scotland. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m at High Cup Gill (Westmorland).|Native|S. galericulata was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined in England as a result of drainage and habitat destruction (Mountford, 1994). Elsewhere there is no evidence for a change in distribution.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America.     © Shannon, P
Scutellaria minor|A perennial herb of wet heaths, bogs, marshes and moist, heathy woodlands on acidic, oligotrophic or slightly mesotrophic soils. 0-440 m (Woodhead, Cheshire).|Native|Many populations of S. minor were lost before 1930, and the range shown in the 1962 Atlas has continued to contract as a result of drainage and habitat loss.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Secale cereale|An annual, sometimes occurring in wheat and barley fields as a grain alien or relic of cultivation. It is also found, usually as a casual from grass-seed or bird-seed, on roadsides, manure heaps, rubbish tips, waste ground and even the cracks in pavements. Lowland.|Casual|S. cereale was formerly widely cultivated, but is now seldom grown in the British Isles. It was recorded in the wild by 1865, but current distributional trends are unclear.|Only known in cultivation; widely grown in temperate regions in N. & S. hemispheres.
Sedum acre|A perennial herb of dry, undisturbed and open habitats on skeletal, or virtually non-existent, acidic or basic soils. Typical natural habitats include shingle, sand dunes, cliffs and steeply sloping, S.-facing rocks. It is also frequent on walls, roofs, gravel tracks, pavements and road verges. It is resistant to grazing. 0-500 m (Arncliffe, Mid-W. Yorks.), with an exceptional record at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of S. acre is stable, except in Cornwall and Ireland where it is now only locally plentiful.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Sedum album|This creeping perennial herb grows on open, dry sites, such as limestone rocks, walls, roofs, the concrete of old airfield runways, maritime shingle, paths and gravel on graves. 0-570 m (Hartside, Cumberland).|Archaeophyte|S. album is treated here as an alien, though some authors have suggested that it may possibly occur as a native on limestone rocks at the eastern end of the Mendips and in S. Devon. There has been a marked increase in the frequency of this species since the 1962 Atlas.|As an archaeophyte S. album has a Submediterranean-Subatlantic distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.
Sedum anglicum|This creeping perennial herb of base-poor substrates occurs on rocks, dunes and shingle, and is also known from dry grassland. It is a characteristic plant of open ground on acidic rock outcrops near the sea. It also grows on old walls, rocky hedge banks, and quarries and mine spoil on acidic substrates. 0-1080 m (Snowdon, Caerns.).|Native|The only appreciable change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas is an increase of inland records, representing escapes from cultivation.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Sedum forsterianum|A mat-forming perennial herb of open, dry, well-drained habitats, including rocks and screes, wooded cliffs and gullies. Naturalised colonies are found in churchyards, on waste ground, mine waste, walls and railway land. Lowland to 600 m as native (Llyn y Fan Fach, Carms.).|Native|This species is grown in rockeries and on graves, and has become naturalised in many areas outside its native range. There has been a considerable increase in records since the 1962 Atlas. The distribution of native and introduced plants, even in its core western areas, is now hopelessly muddled.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Sedum rosea|A rhizomatous perennial herb which grows on sea-cliffs and in mountains in rock crevices and on moist rock ledges. Very rarely, in W. Ireland, it occurs on coastal limestone pavement. In montane habitats it usually occupies sites which are at least slightly base-enriched. Although descending to sea level in N.W. Britain and Ireland, it is usually found above 300 m, reaching 1160 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|There has been little change in distribution of S. rosea since the 1962 Atlas. It was previously grown as a source of perfume extracted from the roots, and is occasionally recorded as a garden escape.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.     © Pete Stroh
Sedum rupestre|A perennial herb growing on old walls, rock outcrops, roadside banks and waste ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m in N. Wales, and recorded at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Neophyte|S. rupestre has been cultivated since the 17th century for the leaves, which were eaten as a spring salad. It was known in the wild by 1666. Since the 1962 Atlas its distribution has increased, but it is unclear whether this is due to better recording or a genuine spread.|A European Temperate species, extending from N. Spain to S. Scandinavia and the northern half of the Balkan peninsula.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Sedum telephium|A perennial herb, found on wood-borders, hedge banks, roadsides, rocky banks and in limestone pavement, often in very small but very persistent colonies. It also occurs as an uncommon ancient woodland plant, but sometimes fails to flower in this habitat. 0-455 m (Falcon Clints, Co. Durham).|Native|Although native in some habitats, many colonies have become naturalised near houses as this species is grown in gardens, and the native range is now hopelessly obscured by such escapes; all British records are mapped as if they are native.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Sedum villosum|A small biennial or perennial herb which grows in at least slightly base-enriched, wet, stony ground and on streamsides in hilly areas, and in montane, often bryophyte-rich, flushes. From near sea level to 1100 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth), but mostly between 250 m and 500 m.|Native|Some losses occurred before 1930, and these have continued, especially in lowland areas, due to drainage and forestry. It is probably still present in many upland squares for which there are only pre-1987 records. Its range has, however, been extended westwards since the 1962 Atlas by records from Westerness and Mid Ebudes.|European Boreo-arctic Montane element; also in N. America.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Selaginella selaginoides|A small, perennial, moss-like herb which is characteristic of damp, base-rich sites where there is little competition. Typical habitats include dune-slacks, fens, flushes, mires, wet cliffs and ledges, and short upland grassland. 0-1065 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|S. selaginoides was eliminated from lowland sites in Britain, mainly before 1930, by drainage and habitat destruction. In the uplands, however, there is little evidence for any significant change in its distribution.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Selinum carvifolia|A perennial herb of fens, damp meadows and rough-grazed marshy pasture on calcareous peaty soils or fen peat overlying chalk. It does not grow on the wettest ground in fens, but prefers slightly better-drained fringe areas and low banks. Lowland.|Native|S. carvifolia was last recorded in Lincolnshire in 1931 and in Nottinghamshire by 1952. The species is now confined to three statutorily protected sites in Cambridgeshire, where the plant is thriving.|European Temperate element.
Sempervivum tectorum|A long-lived, evergreen perennial, planted and more or less naturalised on tiled and thatched roofs, old walls, gate pillars and porches, and in churchyards. It is also occasionally found on stabilised sand dunes. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. tectorum has been grown in gardens since at least 1200 (Harvey, 1981), and was often planted on porches and roofs as a supposed protection against fire, lightning and thunderbolts. It was known in the wild by 1629. Some county floras mention a marked decline since the 19th century, especially where old cottages and walls have been pulled down and thatch has been replaced by slate.|Native of the mountains of C. & S. Europe.
Senecio aquaticus|A biennial, sometimes perennial, herb occurring in marshes, wet meadows, rush-pastures, and by streams, ponds and ditches. Generally lowland, but reaching 460 m in Weardale (Co. Durham) and in Co. Wicklow.|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. There has been widespread decline in S. and E. England, and analysis of the database reveals that most losses have occurred since 1950. The decline is probably due to drainage of wet meadows and agricultural intensification.|European Temperate element.
Senecio cambrensis|Typically an annual, though sometimes a short-lived perennial, S. cambrensis grows in open or disturbed sites, including waste and rough ground, on roadsides and footpaths, and in cracks in walls. Lowland.|Native|This species was first collected in Denbighshire in 1925, although the specimen was not identified as S. cambrensis until 1957. The first confirmed record came from Flintshire in 1948. S. cambrensis is believed to have arisen from the hybrid between S. vulgaris and S. squalidus by chromosome doubling. The Welsh and Scottish populations arose independently of each other; it was first recorded in Midlothian in 1974.|Endemic.
Senecio cineraria|An evergreen shrub, sometimes well-established and abundant on cliffs and rough ground near the sea and occurring as a casual inland on rubbish tips, roadside verges and waste ground. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. cineraria, introduced into Britain by 1633, was recorded in the wild by 1893. It is increasingly grown as an ornamental plant in gardens, and increasingly escapes. The map shows a substantial increase since the 1962 Atlas, which cannot be entirely due to the better recording of aliens.|Native of the W. & C. Mediterranean region.     © P. Shannon
Senecio erucifolius|A perennial herb of grassland and disturbed habitats, including hay meadows and pastures, chalk and limestone downland, field-borders, railway banks, roadsides, waste places, shingle banks and fixed sand dunes; it is usually found on neutral or calcareous soils, especially clays that are wet in winter but baked dry in summer. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of S. erucifolius shows little change since the 1962 Atlas, but it may have declined locally, particularly in the English Midlands and at the northern edges of its range.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; also in E. Asia.
Senecio fluviatilis|A tall perennial herb, naturalised by streams and rivers, and in fens, fen-woodland, swamps and marshy grassland. Lowland.|Neophyte|Introduced before 1600 and originally grown for medicinal use, the first record of S. fluviatilis in the wild was in 1633. The somewhat clustered distribution of records suggest independent spread from several different sites; it is now grown in gardens, so many recent records are probably garden escapes. It has persisted in many places, especially in the north, although some pre-1930 colonies have now gone.|S. fluviatilis has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution; it is naturalised in N.W. Europe beyond its native range.
Senecio jacobaea|A biennial or perennial herb, widespread in grassland and especially abundant in neglected, rabbit-infested or overgrazed pastures; it also grows on sand dunes, in scrub, open woods and along woodland rides, waste ground, road verges and waysides, and on rocks, screes and walls. 0-670 m (Atholl, E. Perth, and on Mangerton, S. Kerry).|Native|The distribution of S. jacobaea is unchanged from the map in the 1962 Atlas. It is a notifiable weed, subject to statutory control, but this has clearly had little, if any, effect on its distribution or abundance.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Senecio paludosus|A long-lived perennial herb of tall-herb fens and ditches. The roadside ditch which is now its only native site is usually flooded in winter but dry in summer. Seed-set is poor there, but plants cultivated from material from this site show improved seed-set both in cultivation and at transplantation sites. Lowland.|Native|Many sites for this species were drained in the 18th and 19th centuries. There was no substantiated record between 1857 and 1972, when it was rediscovered near Ely (Cambs.).

Senecio smithii|A tall perennial herb found naturalised as a garden escape or relic of cultivation in grassy meadows and pastures, on roadsides, by lakes and streams and in ditches. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was introduced to Britain in 1895. There is a widely held belief that it was introduced by whalers who brought it back from sailing trips to Patagonia and Chile, and it is known locally as `Falkland Islands Daisy`. However, Scott & Palmer (1987) conclude that most of the Shetland material arrived through normal horticultural channels. It was known from the wild by the 1920s and its distribution is probably stable.|Native of temperate S. America.     © J. Presland
Senecio squalidus|A short-lived perennial herb of waste places, walls, railways, cinders, roadsides and gardens, where it is often thoroughly established on well-drained soils. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was first recorded in 1794 as an escape from Oxford Botanic Garden. It was recorded at scattered localities until the 1850s, but spread rapidly after reaching the railway in Oxford in c. 1879. Since the 1962 Atlas its range has increased and it has spread off railways into other habitats. In Ireland it was naturalised in Cork city by 1845 but its spread from there has been relatively slow.|S. squalidus appears to have arisen in cultivation in the Oxford Botanic Garden (Abbott et al., 2000).
Senecio sylvaticus|An annual of open habitats on heaths, in cleared and burnt woodland, on bushy commons, banks and sea-cliffs, usually growing on sandy, non-calcareous soils. 0-365 m (Rinns of Kells, Kirkcudbrights.).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of S. sylvaticus since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.     © Shannon, P
Senecio viscosus|An annual of free-draining disturbed substrates including sands, gravels and cinders, found on roadsides, banks, wall-tops, pavements, railway ballast, coastal shingle and dunes, in gravel-pits, and on open rough and waste ground. 0-430 m (Nenthead, Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species, first recorded in 1660, has spread greatly since 1900, especially along roads and railways. Since the 1962 Atlas it has spread further into S.W. England and Ireland, and consolidated its range elsewhere.

Several Serapias species have been recorded for Britain, and this is perhaps the most convincingly native. It was first discovered in 1989, and the single known population flowered intermittently until 1998. It may have arisen from wind blown seed and is regarded as native by Madge (1994) and Rich (1997c), but Stace (1997) and Lang (in Rich & Jermy, 1998) are more cautious and regard it as alien. The original population has been augmented by plants raised from seed collected at the site.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Seriphidium maritimum|An aromatic perennial herb occurring in the upper, drier parts of saltmarshes; also found on shingle, sea-cliffs, waste ground and walls close to the sea, by brackish dykes of drained estuarine marshes and on the banks of tidal rivers. Lowland.|Native|S. maritimum was lost from many sites in N. and W. Britain (and some elsewhere) before 1930, with further losses since. It is stable elsewhere and can be locally common, and is now better recorded, or perhaps increasing, in Ireland.|Suboceanic Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Serratula tinctoria|A perennial herb of calcareous grassland, hay and fen-meadows, wet heaths and heathy mires, open scrub and woodland, rocky lake shores and cliff-tops; also in artificial habitats including roadside verges and railway banks. 0-560 m (Fur Tor, Dartmoor, S. Devon).|Native|S. tinctoria has declined in England since the 1962 Atlas, due to drainage, the improvement of pastures and the loss of grasslands in woods and on wood-margins. It was first recorded in Ireland as a casual in 1893. It was found in Co. Wexford in 1925, but has not been seen at its sole locality there since the 1950s and was probably destroyed during the building of a marina.|European Temperate element.
Seseli libanotis|This herb is usually biennial, though it is sometimes a short-lived monocarpic perennial. It is mainly a plant of chalk grassland, but in Cambridgeshire is also found on chalky roadside banks and on ledges in an abandoned chalk quarry.

Sesleria caerulea|A tufted, rhizomatous perennial of well-drained, mainly open habitats on limestone, including grassland and heath, screes and cliffs, and the grikes and clint-hollows of limestone pavement. It extends locally into open woodland in Ireland and N. England, and is found on sandy loams over micaceous schists in Perthshire. 0-1005 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|Because S. caerulea is not very palatable to sheep, it becomes dominant in heavily grazed areas, forming a species-poor turf. It is still abundant in areas of Carboniferous limestone in N. England and the Burren and it was discovered in the Derbyshire Dales in 1989.|European Boreo-temperate element.     © Shannon, P
Setaria viridis|An annual occurring as a casual of cultivated and waste ground, road verges and rubbish tips, mainly introduced in bird-seed but also from wool shoddy, oil-seed, esparto and grain. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. viridis was first recorded in the wild in Britain in 1666. It is now much better recorded than for the 1962 Atlas. Any apparent increases are probably due to increased recording effort in urban areas, and a widening interest in alien taxa, although it is reported as increasing in Somerset (Green et al., 1997).|A native of Eurasia, which now occurs in temperate and subtropical regions throughout the N. hemisphere; this spread has obscured its putative native range.     © G.

Sherardia arvensis|An annual of open, droughted grasslands, sheltered cliffs, sand dunes, arable fields, waste ground, waysides and verges. Mainly lowland, but reaching 365 m in Aberdeenshire.|Native|Formerly frequent, this species is now much decreased due to agricultural intensification. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that most of these losses have occurred since 1950. Whilst remaining common in some coastal localities and locally inland, it is now no more than a rare casual over parts of its range. It may well be native only in some western coastal habitats and an archacophyte elsewhere.|European Southern-temperate element; it is widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Sibbaldia procumbens|This montane perennial herb has two main habitats. It is most abundant in areas of late snow-lie, in corries and hollows and especially under cornices along a ridge. Its other main habitat is on bare, stony surfaces of high plateaux, often in areas of severe wind-scour where permanent snow does not lie. From 425 m (Sgurr na Coinnich, Skye, N. Ebudes) to 1310 m (Ben Nevis, Westerness).|Native|S. procumbens is under-recorded in some areas, though the map is more complete than in the 1962 Atlas.

Sibthorpia europaea|A procumbent perennial herb of acidic soils in damp, shady places, including woodland, banks by small streams and ditches (often creeping over a carpet of mosses), on wet heathland, on thin soil over granite walls or other masonry, on shaded paths and lawns, and occasionally in other damp habitats. 0-515 m (Connor Hill, S. Kerry).|Native|Many more recent records of S. europaea are available now compared with the 1962 Atlas, presumably reflecting the improved recording of this inconspicuous species rather than any increase in range or frequency. In Ireland, it appears to be threatened by the aggressive spread of Epilobium brunnescens.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Silaum silaus|S. silaus is found in damp, unimproved neutral grassland, usually on clay soils. Its habitats include hay- and water-meadows, species-rich pastures and roadsides; it is occasionally found on chalk downs, railway banks and vegetated shingle. Lowland.|Native|The 1962 Atlas indicated little change in the distribution of S. silaus before 1930. Since the 1962 Atlas there is evidence of a small but distinct decline throughout its range, e.g. in Somerset (Green et al., 1997) and Oxfordshire (Killick et al., 1998).|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © Shannon, P
Silene acaulis|This cushion- or mat-forming perennial herb is confined to base-rich substrates. It is characteristic of a species-rich dwarf-herb ledge community on Scottish mountains. However, it also grows in sparse vegetation on exposed mountain plateaux, serpentine fell-fields, cliff-slopes and stabilised sand dunes. From sea level in W. and N. Scotland to 1305 m on Ben Macdui (S. Aberdeen).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of S. acaulis since the 1962 Atlas. It may still be present in many squares for which there are only pre-1987 records.|European Arctic-montane element; also in E. Asia and N. America.
Silene conica|An annual of open habitats on free-draining sandy soils. In coastal regions, it is found on stabilised dunes and sandy shingle, in open pastures and on waste ground; inland it also occurs at the edges of tracks across heathland, in abandoned arable fields and on commons. It flowers freely, but good seed production occurs only in hot summers. Lowland.|Native|Since the 1962 Atlas, S. conica has declined in England and has become extinct as a native plant in Scotland. Remaining populations are often small and vulnerable.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Silene dioica|A short-lived perennial herb that is most prominent in lightly shaded habitats such as hedgerows, coppices, and woodland clearings and rides. It can, however, survive in deep shade in a non-flowering form. It also occurs in coastal habitats, including sheltered cliff-top grassland and scrub, rock crevices, sea-bird rocks and stabilised shingle, and is also found on montane screes and cliffs. 0 - 1065 m (Lochnagar, S. Aberdeen).|Native|There is no change in the distribution of S. dioica since the 1962 Atlas.|European Boreo-temperate element; also in C. Asia.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Silene gallica|A winter-annual of cultivated and disturbed ground, mainly in arable fields on (often acidic) sandy or gravelly soils, and on old walls and waste ground. It also occurs in open, drought-prone coastal grassland on banks and cliffs, and on sand dunes in the Channel Islands. It is sensitive to low winter temperatures. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|S. gallica had been lost by 1930 from many inland sites. Since then it has declined further in response to agricultural intensification, especially from the increased use of herbicides and fertilisers. Many populations are now very small.|As an archaeophyte S. gallica has a Submediterranean-Subatlantic distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Silene latifolia|S. latifolia is usually a short-lived perennial, but it may occasionally be annual or biennial. It occurs on arable land, in hedge banks and waste places, being most abundant on deep, well-drained soils. Mainly lowland, but reaching 425 m in Atholl (E. Perth).|Archaeophyte|Fossil records of S. latifolia in Britain date from the Bronze Age onwards. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. The map suggests a decline at the western edge of its British range.|As an archaeophyte S. latifolia has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Silene noctiflora|This spring-germinating annual occurs mainly on cultivated land, but sometimes also on open waste ground. It is mostly found on dry, sandy and calcareous substrates, but also on heavier soils over oolitic limestone. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|S. noctiflora has declined markedly since the 1950s with the increased use of herbicides and fertilisers, and the shift from spring-sown to autumn-sown crops. This loss still continues.|As an archaeophyte S. noctiflora has a European Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Silene nutans|The coastal habitats of this long-lived perennial herb are grassy cliffs, sand dunes and shingle. Inland, it grows on limestone rock outcrops and cliff ledges. S. nutans is mainly a plant of shallow, drought-prone, calcareous soils on chalk and limestone, but it also occurs on acidic soil overlying shingle. It has occurred as a casual at ports and on railway banks. Reproduction is usually by seed, but can be vegetative by procumbent stems rooting at the nodes. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the coastal distribution of this species, but it has declined inland since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Silene otites|A perennial herb of shallow, well-drained, light calcareous soils. As a native plant, it is confined to Breckland grass-heaths and roadsides, where open, disturbed ground provides sites for seedlings. Mature plants can survive for a while in denser swards, but are eventually excluded. It occurs elsewhere as a casual. Lowland.|Native|S. otites has declined significantly since 1930, the chief causes being agricultural intensification and afforestation. The map shows a contraction since the 1962 Atlas but its distribution is more or less stable at present.|European Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Silene uniflora|A perennial herb occurring on rocky sea-cliffs from the lowest zone of vascular plants to cliff-top grassland, on seaside walls, shingle banks and on drift-lines. It can tolerate high levels of nutrient enrichment, and can be abundant on cliff-tops adjoining sea-bird colonies. It also occurs rarely on upland lake shores, streamsides, river shingle, cliffs and in gullies. Artificial habitats include metalliferous mine spoil, disused railway lines, ballast and tips. 0-775 m (Fairfield, Westmorland), and to 970 m in the Scottish Highlands.|Native|There has been no significant change in the distribution of S. uniflora since the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Boreo-temperate element.
Silene vulgaris|S. vulgaris is a perennial herb found in a wide range of soils in open and grassy habitats, including cultivated and abandoned arable fields, rough pasture, roadside verges, quarries, gravel-pits, railway banks, walls and waste places. It is able to tolerate partial shade and may grow in open woodland and on hedge banks. 0-360 m (Shap Summit, Westmorland).|Native|The map suggests an appreciable decline in the frequency of S. vulgaris since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Silybum marianum|An annual or biennial, found in rough pasture, on grassy banks, in hedgerows and on waste ground. It is locally well-established and persistent, especially in coastal habitats in S. England, but is also a widespread casual. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|S. marianum occurs as an introduction with wool shoddy, bird-, grass- and oil-seed, and as a garden escape. The large number of pre-1987 records is unlikely to reflect a decline in this species, but rather it represents the accumulation of casual records over many years.|Native of the Mediterranean region; naturalised or casual throughout much of Europe and in N. America and Australia.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Simethis planifolia|A rhizomatous, perennial herb found only in dry, rocky, maritime heath near Derrynane on the coast of S. Kerry and the Beara peninsula, W. Cork. It was formerly naturalised near the coast in S. England. Lowland.|Native|There has been some limited damage to the Irish population of S. planifolia from housing development, but its distribution appears to be relatively stable overall. Uncontrolled fires have affected some populations, but these may actually favour the species. The English plants may have been imported with Pinus pinaster. They were known in Dorset from 1847 until c. 1914, and in S. Hampshire in 1915.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Sinapis alba||||
Sinapis arvensis|An annual, abundant as a weed of cultivation and also found on roadsides, railways, tips and waste ground. It is now a frequent weed associated with roadworks. Generally lowland, but reaching 450 m in Clun Forest (Salop).|Archaeophyte|There is little change in the range of S. arvensis, which was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It is easily controlled by herbicides, and thus is less frequent than formerly in arable fields. The seed is, however, long-lived, and populations can readily re-appear on disturbed ground.|As an archaeophyte S. arvensis has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © L. Rooney
Sison amomum|A biennial herb of sticky clay and better drained neutral to calcareous soils, found mainly in hedgerows, on banks, rough scrubby grassland, waysides and disturbed waste ground. Lowland.|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the 10-km distribution of S. amomum since the 1962 Atlas.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.
Sisymbrium altissimum|An annual which is frequently naturalised on rubbish tips and waste ground, and by roads and railways. It is a contaminant of bird-seed and grass-seed mixtures. Populations can be short-lived. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. altissimum was being cultivated in Britain by 1768. Although it was recorded in the wild by 1862 (Middlesex), it was a rare plant until the population was reinforced by plants introduced by troops returning from the First World War battlefields, where it was apparently abundant (Clarke, 1925).|Native of E. Europe and W. Asia; widely naturalised in temperate W. Europe, N. America and elsewhere.
Sisymbrium officinale|An annual or biennial herb of dry, neutral or base-rich soils, doing best in open situations and frequent in cultivated ground, on roadsides and waste ground. It is almost invariably associated with man, but it also occurs rarely in natural habitats such as river-banks. 0-315 m (Garrigill, Cumberland).|Archaeophyte|There has been no significant change in the distribution of S. officinale since the 1962 Atlas.|As an archaeophyte S. officinale has a European Southern-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.
Sisymbrium orientale|An annual naturalised in rough ground and waste places, including railway land. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. orientale was cultivated in Britain by 1739 and is also introduced with grain. It was recorded in the wild by 1859 (Surrey). It has spread since the Second World War, and is more frequent in some areas now than when mapped in the 1962 Atlas.|Native of S. Europe, the Mediterranean region and W. Asia; widely naturalised in temperate Europe.
Sisyrinchium bermudiana|A perennial herb of wet meadows, ditches and lake-shores. Lowland.|Native|There is little evidence of significant change in the distribution of this species in Ireland. Naturalised plants have been reported in Britain, but S. bermudiana has been confused with S. montanum and records need to be checked (Stace, 1997), so any changes in its alien distribution cannot be easily assessed.|Oceanic Wide-temperate element; in Europe restricted to Ireland as a native but widespread in N. America.
Sium latifolium|This perennial herb was once typical of very wet, species-rich, tall-herb fen, which often developed as floating mats at the margins of lakes and large rivers; now it is generally found in ditches, growing amongst other emergent species or in reedswamp. It prefers alkaline conditions. It is readily grazed by stock, and often restricted to inaccessible ditch-banks. Lowland.|Native|The substantial decline of this species was already apparent in the 1962 Atlas and has continued since then, largely due to the effects of habitat destruction, drainage, reclamation and changes in the management of water levels.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Smyrnium olusatrum|A robust perennial herb naturalised in hedge banks, on cliffs, at the base of walls, and on grassy roadsides, pathsides and waste ground, mainly near the sea. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|S. olusatrum was introduced in Roman times, and was widely cultivated until displaced by celery in the 15th century. The distribution is largely unchanged since the 1962 Atlas, although it appears to be increasing in some inland areas. There is no satisfactory explanation for its predominantly coastal distribution as some inland populations have persisted for many decades.|Native of the Mediterranean region and S. Europe, north to N.W. France.
Solanum dulcamara|A scrambling, woody perennial growing in woodland, thickets, hedgerows, ditches, and, as var. marinum, on shingle beaches. It often grows in moist habitats and is common in swamps and tall-herb fens, and beside rivers and lakes, where it can even grow in shallow water. Lowland.|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the distribution of S. dulcamara since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Solanum nigrum|An annual weed of cultivated and waste land, especially where the soil is nutrient-rich. Lowland.|Native|S. nigrum may be native in S.E. England, but it is certainly introduced and usually casual in N. England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. It was recorded in the wild by 1597. It appears to have declined at the edge of its native distribution, but these populations may have been only casual. Some alien records may refer to subsp. schultesii from S. Europe.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Solanum sarachoides|An erect or decumbent annual, found as a casual on cultivated ground, rubbish tips and waste ground. Rarely, it becomes naturalised. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. sarachoides was recorded in the wild in 1897 (S. Lincs.). In common with several other casual American aliens, it is often associated with carrot seed, and was imported by this means during the Second World War. It appears to be increasing in Britain, but some records may result from confusion with the more widespread S. physalifolium.|Native of S. America.
Solanum tuberosum|A rhizomatous perennial herb of cultivated and waste land, rubbish tips and on coastal sand and shingle where domestic waste has been dumped. In disturbed habitats it is usually casual, but the production of tubers allows some populations in more stable sites to become established. Lowland.|Neophyte|Potatoes have been cultivated in the Andes for at least 7000 years. S. tuberosum was introduced to England in about 1590, becoming a staple food of the poor, especially in Scotland and Ireland, by 1800. It was known from the wild by at least 1908, and its distribution is likely to be stable, but like many crop casuals, the species is under-recorded in some areas.|Native of S. America.
Soleirolia soleirolii|This evergreen, procumbent, carpet-forming perennial herb is found on damp paths, shaded banks and roadside walls, and in sheltered places in churchyards and gardens, usually close to habitation. It is somewhat frost-sensitive. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. soleirolii is a frequent escape from gardens and greenhouses. It has been cultivated in Britain since 1905 and was recorded as naturalised by 1917. It has increased markedly since the 1962 Atlas, with a considerable extension of range northwards and eastwards from its headquarters in S.W. England.|A native of the W. Mediterranean islands.     © Shannon, P
Solidago canadensis|A tall, rhizomatous perennial herb naturalised on roadsides, by railways and on river banks, waste ground and spoil heaps on a wide range of soil types. Garden throw-outs can be very persistent; the plants are fertile and spread by seed. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. canadensis was introduced into cultivation in Britain in 1648, and it is now very popular in gardens. It was recorded in the wild in 1888 in Oxfordshire, but did not become widespread until 1930. Although formerly confused with S. gigantea, the maps are probably reliable in indicating that S. canadensis is the commoner of the two in S. Britain. It is likely to be increasing.|Native of N. America; widely naturalised in Europe.     © Shannon, P
Solidago gigantea|A tall, rhizomatous perennial herb naturalised in waste places, by railways, on roadside verges, river banks and rubbish tips on a wide range of soil types. Most plants in the wild originate from the dumping of garden rubbish and probably spread further by seed. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. gigantea was cultivated in Britain by 1758, and it is now commonly grown in gardens. It was known from the wild by 1916 but, like S. canadensis, it did not become widespread until after 1930. It is likely to be spreading.|Native of N. America; widely naturalised in Europe.
Solidago virgaurea|A perennial herb of free-draining, usually acidic (occasionally basic) substrates in a wide range of habitats. In the lowlands these include woods, hedge banks, heaths, banks and coastal cliff-tops; in the uplands, cliff ledges, rocks by waterfalls, rocky streamsides, tall-herb communities in gullies, montane grass-heath and fell-field. 0-1095 m (Ben Dearg, E. Ross).|Native|S. virgaurea was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Populations in lowland Britain are disappearing due to habitat loss and analysis of the database reveals that much of this decline has occurred since 1950. It is a very variable species, with many different ecotypes.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.
Sonchus arvensis|A creeping perennial herb of roadside verges, ditch and river banks, sea-walls and the upper parts of beaches and saltmarshes, particularly along strand lines; it is also frequent in arable fields, where it can be a weed, and on waste ground. It prefers disturbed, nutrient-enriched soils. 0-445 m (near Bishop`s Castle, Salop).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of S. arvensis since the 1962 Atlas. A glabrous form, subsp. uliginosus, has been recorded throughout Britain, usually from wetter habitats. Its taxonomic status and ecology require further study.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.
Sonchus asper|An overwintering annual of rough grassland, scrub, roadside verges, quarries, rock outcrops, railway lines, arable fields, manure heaps, gardens and waste places. It prefers dry, disturbed, sandy soils and is intolerant of grazing, but can be an invasive weed of bare ground. S. asper tolerates rather wetter conditions than S. oleraceus and is more frequent in the uplands. 0-395 m (Weardale, Co. Durham).|Native|There has been no discernible change in the distribution of S. asper since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © Shannon, P
Sonchus oleraceus|An overwintering annual of disturbed or trampled grasslands, coastal cliff-slopes, roadside verges, arable fields, manure heaps, walls, pavement cracks, gardens and waste places. It is intolerant of grazing but an invasive weed of bare ground. It is more frequent in coastal habitats than S. asper but less frequent in the uplands. 0-365 m (Kisdon, N.W. Yorks.).|Native|There has been no discernible change in the distribution of S. oleraceus since the 1962 Atlas.|European Southern-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Sonchus palustris|A perennial herb of tall vegetation beside rivers on damp peaty or silty soils rich in nitrogen. It is also moderately tolerant of saline conditions, and can grow near tidal river mouths. Lowland.|Native|Whilst urban developments have caused a decline in S. palustris in the Thames Valley and in Kent there is some evidence of an increase in Broadland and E. Suffolk. It became extinct in Cambridgeshire through drainage long before 1930, but has spread from a colony introduced to Woodwalton Fen (Hunts.). The Hampshire population, though first found in 1959, appears to be native. The Yorkshire plants are thought to have been introduced with Salix from East Anglia.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Sorbus anglica|A shrub or small tree, occurring in open rocky woods and scrub, and on more exposed cliffs and stony slopes, usually on limestone, but locally also on other more or less base-rich rocks. An apomict, varying somewhat in different parts of its range. It seems to regenerate freely from seed.

Sorbus arranensis|A shrub or small tree of rocky streamsides and outcrops on granite. It is a fully fertile apomictic hybrid derived from S. aucuparia and S. rupicola, and natural regeneration occurs. Lowland.|Native|The population of about 400 trees is probably about the same size as that of S. pseudofennica, but is somewhat more widely distributed within its restricted range. There is no evidence of any significant change in its distribution or population size since 1970.|Endemic.
Sorbus aucuparia|A small to medium-sized tree of woods, cliffs, rock outcrops and rocky riversides. It can also be bird-sown from planted trees on waste ground and by railways. It avoids calcareous and heavy soils and dense shade. A sexual species, it flowers and fruits freely. 0-870 m (Helvellyn, Cumberland, and in the Rannoch area, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in the native distribution of S. aucuparia since the 1962 Atlas. The apparent increase probably results from increased recording of planted trees, some of which may be erroneously mapped as native.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.
Sorbus bristoliensis|A medium-sized tree of rocky scrub and woodland on Carboniferous limestone. It is apomictic, and fruiting can be erratic. Lowland.|Native|This species is very localised, occurring on both sides of the Avon Gorge where the total population of about a hundred trees may be increasing in response to conservation management.|Endemic.
Sorbus devoniensis|A large shrub to medium-sized tree found in hedgerows, rocky (often coastal) woodland, and occasionally in more open moorland situations, mainly on non-calcareous shale, slates and grit. It is apomictic. Fruit is abundant in favourable years, and the species readily establishes from seed, with young trees frequent in suitable habitats. Lowland.|Native|S. devoniensis is better recorded now than when mapped by Perring & Sell (1968), and its overall distribution since then appears to be stable. It is mainly a hedgerow plant in its core area in N. Devon, but is found in undoubted natural habitats on the coast. Its range in both Devon and Ireland may have been extended by past planting for fruit.|Endemic.
Sorbus domestica|A shrub or small tree found on S.-facing coastal cliff ledges and in cliff scrub and gorge woodland, mostly on limestone, but occasionally on mudstone or shale. Although a sexual species, flowering is often poor and fruit rarely produced. Suckering is frequent. Lowland.|Native|This species was originally known as a single tree in the Wyre Forest (Worcs.), first described in 1678. Five trees now exist near there, these probably being cuttings from the original. However, its wild coastal-cliff habitat was discovered in 1973, and 22 trees are now known in Wales and 8 in England. It is also rarely grown in gardens and parks.|European Southern-temperate element.
Sorbus eminens|A small to medium-sized tree of rocky grassland, scrub and open woodland, usually on Carboniferous limestone. Fruiting tends to be erratic, but plants regenerate from seed where conditions are suitable. Lowland.|Native|This species may include several taxa. The type plant is from the Wye valley, and populations there differ from populations elsewhere and are probably not conspecific with them.|Endemic.
Sorbus hibernica|This small to medium-sized tree occurs in rocky grassland, hedges, scrub and open woodland, most often on Carboniferous limestone. It is apomictic and reproduces by seed. Lowland.|Native|This species is apparently somewhat variable. It is morphologically close to S. eminens, and has the same peroxidase phenotype. The distribution appears to be stable.|Endemic.
Sorbus intermedia|This tree is frequently self-sown in copses and on waste ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 380 m near Alston (Cumberland).|Neophyte|S. intermedia was introduced to cultivation in 1789, and is now widely planted as an ornamental tree, especially in town streets and parks. It was known from the wild by 1908, and is much more frequent than when it was mapped by Perring & Sell (1968).|Native of S. Sweden and the Baltic region.
Sorbus lancastriensis|This shrub or small tree occurs on cliffs, rock outcrops and rocky scrub or open woodland, usually on Carboniferous limestone. It is apomictic, sets fruit freely, and regeneration occurs where grazing allows.

Sorbus leptophylla|An apomictic small tree, typically forming a loose sprawling mass on vertical Carboniferous limestone cliffs, with Fraxinus excelsior and other trees, occasionally as more upright individuals on steep rocky slopes. From 290 m (Craig-y-Rhiwarth) to about 380 m (Craig-y-Cilau, Brecs.).|Native|The two small populations in S. Wales are probably stable. A few small trees on Craig Breidden (Monts.) with similar leaf and fruit shape and peroxidase phenotype appear to belong to this species.|Endemic.
Sorbus leyana|A shrub or small tree, found in scrub or open woodland on Carboniferous limestone crags. This apomictic species usually produces fruit only sparsely, and germination is poor, with little natural regeneration occurring. Lowland, reaching c. 300 m on Darren Fach (Brecs.).|Native|Approximately twenty trees of this species are known, in two very localised populations about a kilometre apart. Saplings are vigorous when grown in cultivation from wild seed, and some of them have been planted at one of the native sites (Penmoelallt, Brecs.) to bolster the natural population of only three trees.|Endemic.
Sorbus minima|An apomictic shrub or small tree which grows on crags and steep rocky slopes on Carboniferous limestone near Llangattock, Breconshire. Fruit is abundant in good years. 360-480 m on Craig-y-Cilau (Brecs.).|Native|Though very localised, this species occurs in considerable quantity in its main area, and the population is probably stable.|Endemic.
Sorbus porrigentiformis|A shrub or small tree of cliffs and rock outcrops, occasionally found in rocky grassland or persisting into woodland, usually on Carboniferous or other hard limestones, very locally on other rocks. It is apomictic, and readily sets fruit, though the amount varies from year to year. Lowland to about 530 m on Craig Cerrig-gleisiad (Brecs.).|Native|This species is well circumscribed, and is one of our more widespread apomictic Sorbus microspecies. The distribution appears to be stable.|Endemic.
Sorbus pseudofennica|This shrub or small tree grows on the rocky sides of stream ravines and granite crags, and on rocky moorland, and is occasionally found on flatter, well-drained ground by the stream bed. It is apomictic and fully fertile. Lowland.|Native|There is no evidence of any change in the population of this species since 1970. Most of the population, totalling about 400 trees, is in a single site.|Endemic.
Sorbus rupicola|A shrub or small tree of cliffs and rock outcrops, generally found on hard limestones or other basic rocks, most often in exposed sites but also in less exposed rocky woodland. From near sea level in S. Devon and the Gower to 500 m at Creag Bhuilg in Glen Avon (Banffs.).|Native|This is the most widespread apomictic Sorbus species in Britain, but many populations are small, sometimes consisting of only a single tree.

Sorbus subcuneata|This apomictic, small to medium-sized tree, is generally found in open, rocky Quercus petraea woodland on Old Red Sandstone. In favourable seasons, abundant fruit is produced. Young trees are frequent. Lowland.|Native|This species is mainly concentrated in the East Lyn valley near Watersmeet (N. Devon), with small outlying populations to the east and west. The population appears to be generally stable.|Endemic.
Sorbus torminalis|A medium-sized tree on a wide variety of soils, often clayey, or over limestone, found in old woods and hedgerows and occasionally in scrub. Planted trees occur in parks and plantations. This is one of our three widespread sexually-reproducing species of Sorbus, and it may also form small stands through root-layering. Lowland.|Native|S. torminalis is often regarded as an indicator of ancient woodland. It is easily overlooked and is more frequent than was thought at the time of the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Sorbus vexans|This small tree is found in rocky woodland on Old Red Sandstone, occasionally in open cliff scrub close to the shore but more usually 0.2-0.6 km inland. It is unusual among the aria-group of species in occurring entirely on acid soils. It is an apomictic species in which fruiting is erratic from year to year, but after favourable seasons saplings are frequent. Lowland.|Native|The total population probably numbers a hundred or more trees, and has undergone no substantial change since the species was described in 1957.|Endemic.
Sorbus wilmottiana|This apomictic small tree or scrub occurs only on steep, rocky, Carboniferous limestone slopes in the Avon Gorge (N. Somerset and W. Gloucs.). Lowland.|Native|This species was first described in 1967. It has always been rare, and the population currently comprises only a few trees.|Endemic.
Sparganium angustifolium|A perennial herb of clear, oligotrophic water, only rarely extending into mesotrophic conditions. It is most frequent in upland lakes but also grows in pools, rivers, streams, canals and ditches. Many sites are exposed to strong winds, but it prefers water 0.3-1.5 m deep, away from the most exposed shallows. 0-1005 m (Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth).|Native|Because of taxonomic uncertainty, and its presence in areas which were poorly recorded, this species was seriously under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas. Some populations in N.E. Ireland and along the eastern edge of the Scottish range have been lost, possibly owing to eutrophication.|European Boreal-montane element; also in E. Asia and N. America.
Sparganium emersum|A perennial herb of still or slowly flowing, mesotrophic or eutrophic waters in lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, canals and ditches. Like S. erectum, it is a rhizomatous perennial but it usually grows in deeper water. It is tolerant of disturbance and may be frequent even in heavily managed rivers. 0-500 m (Crook Burn, Cumberland).|Native|The map shows that S. emersum is more frequent than was apparent in the 1962 Atlas, when the taxonomy of the floating-leaved Sparganium species was probably less well-understood by many recorders.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Sparganium erectum|A rhizomatous perennial emergent which grows in shallow water in lakes, rivers, streams, canals and ditches. Although it usually occurs in a narrow band at the water`s edge, it is sometimes found as larger stands in swamps. It grows in mesotrophic or eutrophic habitats, and is very tolerant of eutrophication. Cattle will eat it readily, and it is often absent or rare on grazed lake shores. 0-425 m (Nant Groes, Cards.).|Native|The distribution of this species is essentially similar to that mapped in the 1962 Atlas, with additional records probably attributable to more effective recording.|Circumpolar Temperate element, but absent from eastern N. America.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Sparganium natans|S. natans grows in shallow, sheltered waters at the edges of lakes, or in ponds, slowly flowing streams and drainage ditches. It is found in mesotrophic, highly calcareous to acidic waters. Its rhizomes are short and it usually reproduces by seed. 0-650 m (Lochan Achlarich, Mid Perth).|Native|The contraction of the range of this species, with the loss of most populations in the lowlands, was already apparent by 1930, and this decline has continued. These losses are attributable to the drainage of wetlands in historic times, and perhaps to eutrophication of surviving sites. The distribution elsewhere appears to be more stable.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Spartina alterniflora|A rhizomatous perennial herb planted and naturalised on intertidal mud flats. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. alterniflora was being grown in Britain by 1816; it was planted in Southampton Water (S. Hants.) and was first recorded from there in 1829. It initially spread at this site, but then declined, and has been further reduced by dredging since the 1970s. It was planted in E. Ross in 1920, S. Essex in 1935 and Dorset in 1963.|Native of N. America; naturalised in France.
Spartina anglica|A rhizomatous perennial herb of tidal mud-flats and saltmarshes, much planted as a mud-binder and forming extensive stands in many estuaries. It originated in Southampton Water (S. Hants.) in about 1890 as an amphidiploid derivative of S. x townsendii. Lowland.|Native|The taxon was included within S. x townsendii in the 1962 Atlas, by which time it had become widespread both through deliberate planting and natural colonisation. It is not possible to separate native and planted populations and all are mapped as if they are native.|Endemic as a native to Britain, but widely planted in W. Europe.     © P. Shannon
Spartina maritima|A perennial herb of tidal mud-flats, generally at higher elevations than S. anglica, such as in saltmarsh creeks and pans, and on bare ground behind sea walls. It rarely sets seed in Britain, relying instead on vegetative spread by means of extensively creeping rhizomes. Lowland.|Native|The range of this species has contracted during the past century, due partly to the spread of S. anglica. However, habitat loss - whether through successional changes, coastal erosion or land-claim - may have been important factors in the demise of many populations.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Spergula arvensis|The only native populations of this annual appear to be those of the genetically dwarf var. nana on granite cliff ledges in the Channel Islands (McClintock, 1987b). Elsewhere it is an archaeophyte found in open, disturbed habitats on light, often sandy soils, most frequently in arable fields but also on seashores, roadsides and waste ground. It tends to avoid calcareous soils. 0-450 m (Clun Forest, Salop).|Native|S. arvensis was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Its decline reflects agricultural intensification and the loss of arable land in the uplands.|Eurosiberian Wide-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-temperate.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Spergularia bocconei|This annual or biennial herb occurs on freely-draining skeletal or sandy soils on waste ground by the sea, including dockyards, roadsides and car parks. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. bocconei was first recorded in Britain in 1901. All extant populations are small and vulnerable, although it has been found at new sites in Cornwall and in E. Kent in the last ten years. Although sometimes considered native, its ruderal habitat and the failure of populations to persist suggest that it is more likely to be an introduction.|A Mediterranean-Atlantic species.
Spergularia marina|An annual of saltmarshes, sea-walls, muddy shingle, brackish grazing pastures and the base of coastal cliffs. Inland, it is a local colonist of the margins of saline sludge lagoons, and also occurs beside salt-treated roads. Generally lowland, but reaching 520 m on a roadside at Holme Moss (Cheshire).|Native|There are many more coastal records of this species than in the 1962 Atlas, probably due to better recording. Since the late 1970s it has undergone a remarkable expansion of range along inland roadsides.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Spergularia media|The natural habitats of this perennial herb are strictly maritime. It is found in saltmarshes, on muddy beaches, banks and low cliffs, in tidally inundated dune-slacks, and on the margins of saline ditches in coastal grazing marshes. In saltmarshes, it is generally found at lower elevations than S. marina. Inland, it occurs very occasionally as a colonist of salt-treated roadsides. Lowland.|Native|There has been no significant change in the distribution since the 1962 Atlas other than its colonisation of road verges, first noted in the late 1970s.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Spergularia rubra|An annual or biennial herb, typically occurring in open habitats on free-draining acidic sands and gravels. Habitats include heaths, commons, tracks (particularly forestry tracks in W. Scotland), quarries, gravel- and sand-pits, railway yards and waste ground. It occasionally grows on stabilised shingle and sand dunes. It is tolerant of trampling. Generally lowland, but recorded at over 560 m on Deadwater Fell (S. Northumb.).|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, although there have been local declines in the English Midlands.|European Southern-temperate element; also in N. America and widely naturalised outside its native range.
Spergularia rupicola|A perennial herb of maritime rocks and cliffs, growing in crevices, on ledges and on friable rock surfaces, sometimes in guano-enriched sites near sea-bird colonies. It also grows in short cliff-top grassland and on the masonry of piers and walls near the sea. It is indifferent to soil reaction. Lowland.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of S. rupicola since the 1962 Atlas. It may be under-recorded in W. Ireland.|Oceanic Temperate element; restricted to the coast of W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Spiranthes aestivalis|A rhizomatous perennial herb formerly occurring amongst Sphagnum in valley bogs in the New Forest (S. Hants.), in a Sphagnum bog on Guernsey, and on wet, sandy ground beside St. Ouen`s Pond on Jersey. Lowland.|Native|This species is extinct in our area. The last record was in 1959 from the New Forest (S. Hants.), where it suffered from a combination of drainage and over-collecting. It was lost from the Channel Islands for the same reasons, becoming extinct in Guernsey in 1914 and last recorded in Jersey in c. 1925.|European Temperate element.
Spiranthes romanzoffiana|A rhizomatous herb of acidic, nutrient poor, periodically flooded or flushed vegetation, often growing on peaty soils by rivers, streams and lake margins. It frequently occurs amongst Molinia caerulea in pastures grazed by cattle or ponies. Reproduction is mostly vegetative in our area. Lowland.|Native|This species is now known from many more sites in Britain and N. Ireland, thanks to a deliberate recording effort, but may still be under-recorded. In Britain some sites have been lost to drainage and reclamation.|Oceanic Boreal-montane element; in Europe restricted to Britain and Ireland but widespread in N. America.
Spiranthes spiralis|A rhizomatous herb of unimproved, well-grazed grassland on dry calcareous soils, especially on chalk and limestone, and on cliff-tops and sand dunes; also on lawns and, rarely, on less acidic heathland. It can persist for many years without flowering, appearing in hundreds when grazing or mowing ceases. Lowland.|Native|This species declined considerably, particularly before 1930, when many pastures were re-sown or converted to arable. The 1962 Atlas included the results of a survey conducted in the hot summer of 1955, when it flowered profusely on uncut lawns (Perring, 1956). Losses due to agricultural intensification and undergrazing still occur.|European Southern-temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Spirodela polyrhiza|S. polyrhiza grows in base-rich water in ponds, ditches, canals and slowly flowing rivers. It is particularly frequent in grazing marshes. Flowers have only been seen once in our area (in 1906) and reproduction is by vegetative budding. Lowland.|Native|The loss of populations of S. polyrhiza in the northern part of its British range was already apparent before 1930. There have been local losses since then as ponds have disappeared or grazing marshes have been converted to arable land, but the species remains frequent within its core areas, and is much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element.
Stachys alpina|A perennial herb of open woodlands, wood-borders, hedge banks and trackways on thin soils overlying calcareous rock. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. alpina was cultivated in Britain by 1597. Although it has long been considered to be native, this is extremely doubtful; Kay & John (1995) conclude that it is a relatively recent introduction. The Gloucestershire population may have spread shortly after its discovery in 1897, but is now apparently stable, albeit maintained artificially by sowing seed. It was found in Denbighshire in 1927, but colonies there are slowly declining; remaining plants are often re-introductions. It can reappear after disturbance, however, and buried seed may exist in former sites.|S. alpina has a European Temperate distribution.
Stachys arvensis|A summer- or winter-annual of arable fields, allotments and gardens, waste ground and road verges, usually on non-calcareous soils. It occurs on limestone outcrops in W. Ireland. Generally lowland, but reaching 380 m near Simonsbath (S. Somerset).|Archaeophyte|S. arvensis was formerly a frequent weed of arable land. Mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, analysis of the database reveals that many losses took place before 1950, but its decline has accelerated since then.|As an archaeophyte S. arvensis has a Suboceanic Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Stachys germanica|A biennial or short-lived perennial herb of woodland margins, grassy banks, ancient hedgerows and green lanes overlying oolitic limestone; occasionally recorded from stony fields and quarries. The reappearance of plants following disturbance and scrub clearance suggests that seeds remain viable over long periods. Lowland.|Native|S. germanica may have been more widespread than the current map suggests, but it declined markedly in the 19th century. It became confined to the present small area of Oxfordshire before 1930, and, though it is still restricted to this area, recent conservation work has bolstered the population to some extent.|European Temperate element.
Stachys officinalis|A perennial herb of hedge banks, grassland, heaths, open woods and woodland rides and margins. It is occasionally found in cliff-top grassland, sometimes as the genetically dwarf var. nana. It favours mildly acidic soils, but is also found on those that are neutral or somewhat calcareous. 0-460 m (Teesdale, Westmorland).|Native|S. officinalis has suffered local losses in England and Ireland as a result of the loss and improvement of permanent pastures, the ploughing of fields to the edge of woods with consequent loss of the marginal flora and the shading of woodland grassland following a decline in coppicing.|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia.     © P. Shannon
Stachys palustris|A perennial herb of damp places. It grows by streams, rivers, ditches and ponds, in fens, marshes and swamps, on rough ground and occasionally in cultivated fields. It is typically found on intermittently flooded and poorly drained soils. 0?540 m (Moor House, Teesdale, Westmorland).|Native|There is little evidence of any change in the overall distribution of S. palustris. It was mapped in the 1962 Atlas as `all records`. Broad-leaved forms of S. x ambigua have formerly been mistaken for S. palustris by visitors to Scotland, and some such errors may still be mapped.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.
Stachys palustris x sylvatica (S. x ambigua)|A sterile rhizomatous perennial herb occurring in the habitats of either parent, but frequently in the absence of both. It grows besides streams, on river banks and roadsides, on the edge of woodland, on waste ground and as a weed of cultivated ground, particularly in the north and west where it occurs in the absence of S. sylvatica. It reproduces by rhizome fragments. 0?300 m (Pentre Llyncwmmer, Cards.).|Native|Although localised declines have been reported (e.g. Mountford, 1994), and the map shows some loss in S.E. England, there is no evidence for an appreciable change in the distribution of S. x ambigua, and it may be more frequent than the current map suggests.|Widespread in Europe.
Stachys sylvatica|A rhizomatous perennial of woods, hedgerows, the banks of rivers and streams, rough grassland and waste places, and, locally, a persistent garden weed. It characteristically grows in moist, fertile, mildly acidic to basic soils in disturbed or lightly to moderately shaded sites. It spreads by vigorous rhizomatous extension, and reproduces by seed and by rhizome fragments. 0-500 m (above Malham, Mid-W. Yorks.), with an exceptional record at 845 m on Great Dun Fell (Westmorland).|Native|There is no evidence for a change in the overall distribution of S. sylvatica.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Stellaria graminea|A perennial herb of damp or free-draining, neutral and acidic soils. Habitats include woodland clearings, neglected pastures, hay meadows, grass-heaths, hedge banks and waysides. It is tolerant of some nutrient enrichment, and is often a constituent of neglected pasture. 0-740 m (Knock Fell, Westmorland).|Native|There has been no appreciable change in its distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Stellaria holostea|This winter-green perennial herb occurs in hedgerows, copses and woodland margins, and on unmanaged grassy roadsides. It tolerates a wide range of soils, but does best on those that are moist, mildly acid and infertile. It avoids permanently wet conditions and the most freely-drained substrates. 0-915 m (Beinn an Dothaidh, Main Argyll), although this record was for a non-flowering specimen.|Native|There seems to be little change in the national distribution of S. holostea, which was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Stellaria media|An annual or a short-lived perennial herb, capable of two or three generations in a year, found in a wide range of disturbed habitats, especially in nutrient-enhanced conditions. It is a conspicuous weed of gardens or crops, also found on manure heaps, in sewage works, on walls, and often in recently established plantations. It is also a characteristic plant of coastal strand lines and sea-bird rocks. 0-950 m (Mt Brandon, S. Kerry).|Native|There seems to have been little change in the range of S. media since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Wide-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Wide-temperate.
Stellaria media agg.||||
Stellaria neglecta|An annual to short-lived perennial herb of damp, shaded places such as hedgerows, wood margins, streamsides and the borders of damp copses, on a range of soils from stiff, poorly-drained clays to damp sand and peaty alluvium. Generally lowland, but reaching 440 m at Kinloch Rannoch (Mid Perth).|Native|S. neglecta is now known to be much more frequent than was appreciated in the 1962 Atlas in S.W. England, East Anglia and Wales. Conversely, there is some evidence for losses in S.E. England. Records in Ireland have only been accepted if based on critically determined specimens; some British records may be errors for the variable S. media.|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia.
Stellaria nemorum|This herbaceous, stoloniferous perennial prefers fertile soils and occurs mostly in damp, shaded habitats, and sometimes on periodically flooded ground. It is usually found by streamsides and ditches and in wet woods and damp hedge banks. Generally lowland, but reaching c. 915 m above Coire Kander (S. Aberdeen).|Native|There has been no significant change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas. Subsp. nemorum occurs throughout the range of the species; subsp. montana is mapped separately.|European Boreo-temperate element.
Stellaria pallida|An annual growing in open conditions on light, well-drained soils. Near the coast it is found on sand dunes, shingle and in other sandy or stony places; elsewhere it occurs on waste and cultivated ground, in gravel- and sand-pits and on tracks in conifer plantations. It is sometimes also found in lawns and on walls. Lowland.|Native|There are now many more records than in the 1962 Atlas, and an extension of its range in Scotland. This is probably a result of better recording of this inconspicuous, spring-flowering species.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Stellaria palustris|This perennial, rhizomatous herb is a species of damp and wet places, including pastures, grassy fens and marshes, especially in areas with standing water in winter. It is also able to colonise artificial habitats such as old peat diggings. Generally lowland, but reaching 360 m on Cronkley Fell (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|Many sites were lost in C. & E. England before 1930, and losses have continued in most parts of its British range.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Stellaria uliginosa|A mat-forming, winter-green perennial, occurring in a range of wet habitats including mires, wet grassland, streamsides, river-banks and ditches, and especially characteristic of cattle-poached areas. 0-885 m (Helvellyn, Cumberland) with unlocalised records up to 1005 m in the Scottish Highlands.|Native|This species was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined in S. and E. England, and analysis of the database indicates that this has occurred since 1950, presumably due to drainage, the re-seeding of wet grasslands, or their conversion to arable.|European Temperate element; also in C. and E. Asia and N. America and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Stratiotes aloides|"Native populations of this perennial herb are found in calcareous, meso-eutrophic lakes, ponds and ditches. Alien colonies occur in a range of other habitats, including canals. All our plants are female, reproducing vegetatively. Lowland.
 



      Trends    

Native or alien (change +1.65). This species was first recorded in 1633, and the presence of only one sex suggests that it may not be native (Cook & Urmi-König, 1983). In Britain apparently native populations have been in long-term decline, probably due to eutrophication. Alien populations are often short-lived. Forbes (2000) argues that it may be native in Co. Fermanagh.

Suaeda maritima|An annual found in the middle and lower parts of saltmarshes, often with Salicornia species. It is an early colonist of intertidal mud- and sand-flats, sometimes also occurring higher up in salt-pans and drift-lines, on shell and shingle banks, and in thinly vegetated brackish areas behind sea-walls.

Lowland.|Native|There is little evidence of any recent change in distribution. Some populations have probably been lost in the past through agricultural reclamation. It is probably alien in Anglesey; if it were native (Rich & Brown, 2000) it would represent a remarkable extension of its range.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © L. Rooney
Subularia aquatica|An annual aquatic plant, sometimes overwintering as a rosette, growing on silt, gravel or stony substrates in acidic, oligotrophic lakes. It is normally a plant of water shallower than one metre, and is only rarely found in other water bodies, such as outfall streams. 0-825 m (Ffynnon Llyffaint, Caerns.).|Native|Because of better exploration, S. aquatica is now known from many more sites than were mapped in the 1962 Atlas. However, eutrophication seems to have caused declines along the eastern fringe of its range, and also in the Lake District and N. Ireland.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.
Succisa pratensis|A perennial herb, growing in a wide range of moist to moderately free-draining habitats, and favouring mildly acidic soils. It occurs in woodland rides, in heathland and grassland and in mires, and in the uplands on cliff ledges and in ravines. 0-970 m (Carnedd Dafydd, Caerns.).|Native|S. pratensis was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. A widespread decline in S. and E. England has taken place, and analysis of the database reveals that most losses have occurred since 1950. These losses are largely attributable to the improvement of grassland and heaths.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.
Symphoricarpos albus|A bushy rhizomatous shrub widely naturalised in woodland, scrub, hedgerows and on waste ground; also formerly quite widely planted as cover for game in woodland. It reproduces by suckering and fruits freely, but rarely regenerates from seed. It spreads very slowly; dense thickets are normally the result of close initial planting. 0-385 m (Forest-in-Teesdale, Co. Durham).|Neophyte|S. albus was introduced into cultivation in Britain in 1817, and was known from the wild by 1863. Since the 1962 Atlas it has consolidated its position almost everywhere.|Native of N. America; the plant naturalised here is the western var. laevigatus.
Symphytum asperum x officinale (S. x uplandicum)|The habitats of this perennial herb include rough and waste ground, railway banks, roadsides, hedge banks and woodland margins. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m at Alston (Cumberland).|Neophyte|This hybrid was introduced as a forage plant in 1870. It was widely cultivated in Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and known from the wild by 1884. Two cytotypes occur, with 2n=36 and 2n=40. The map in Perring & Sell (1968) was only provisional; it is therefore difficult to assess changes in distribution, though the plant is clearly well-established and probably increasing.|This hybrid is known from the Caucasus; it has been spread in cultivation and is naturalised in temperate Europe.
Symphytum officinale|This tall perennial herb occurs on the banks of streams and rivers, in ditches, fens and marshes, and on damp road verges. Generally lowland, reaching 320 m near Buxton (Derbys.).|Native|S. officinale was over-recorded for S. x uplandicum in the 1962 Atlas and this confusion still obscures its true distribution. It may well be alien in much of N. and W. Britain and in Ireland but it is impossible to determine the native range with any certainty and all records are mapped as if they are native. Both diploid and tetraploid cytotypes occur and are morphologically separable. S. x uplandicum sometimes back-crosses with this parent (Perring, 1994).|European Temperate element; also in C. Asia and widely naturalised outside its native range.
Symphytum orientale|This perennial herb is found as an escape or outcast in hedgerows and copses, on lanesides, by roads and railways, and on waste ground. It is often naturalised, and sometimes regenerates from seed. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. orientale was introduced to gardens by 1752, when it was known to have been grown in Cambridge, and was known from the wild by 1849. Its distribution has increased greatly since the 1962 Atlas owing to a genuine spread, although part of the increase is also due to better recording of alien species.|Native of S. Russia, N.W. Turkey and the Caucasus.
Symphytum tuberosum|The native habitats of this perennial herb are damp woodland, ditches, stream and river banks, where it occurs in both shaded and open situations. As an alien, it occurs on roadside verges, waste ground and other disturbed sites. Generally lowland, but reaching 335 m in Mid Perth.|Native|This species has long been considered introduced to Ireland, Wales and most of England. In Scotland too its native status is sometimes questioned, partly in view of its late discovery (1777), and the limit of any native range has been obscured by escapes. There is no significant change in its presumed native distribution since the 1962 Atlas, though alien records are much more frequent in England.|European Temperate element.
Syringa vulgaris|A strongly suckering deciduous shrub, occurring as a relic of cultivation in sites of former habitation, or more or less naturalised in hedges, on roadsides, railway banks, tips and waste ground. It is occasionally planted for hedging well away from habitation. Reproduction is mostly vegetative, and establishment from seed is rare. Lowland.|Neophyte|S. vulgaris was cultivated in Britain by 1597, becoming extremely popular in parks and gardens in the 19th century. It was known from the wild by at least 1879. The astonishing increase in records since the 1962 Atlas is probably due to both better recording of aliens and a genuine increase.|Native of S.E. Europe, but modified by selection and cultivation.
Tamus communis|A dioecious, tuberous liane, found mostly on neutral to calcareous, well-drained soils, particularly those overlying chalk and limestone, but also on clay. It can be luxuriant in hedgerows, woodland edges and along paths and in waste land, but is often found in a depauperate, non-flowering state in woodland. It possesses a very large tuber and therefore avoids shallow or waterlogged soil. It is bird-sown, but is not a good colonist. Lowland.|Native|There is no change in the overall distribution of T. communis since the 1962 Atlas.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © P. Shannon
Tanacetum parthenium|An aromatic perennial herb commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is widely naturalised in gardens, on walls, waysides, tips and waste ground. It seeds freely, but has a poorly formed pappus, and disperses for only short distances; it is therefore most frequent near habitation. 0-380 m (above Alston, Cumberland).|Archaeophyte|T. parthenium was being grown in gardens for medicinal use by 995 (Harvey, 1981). Its distribution has not changed significantly since the 1962 Atlas.|Apparently native to the Balkan peninsula; now widespread in temperate regions throughout the world.
Tanacetum vulgare|An aromatic, rhizomatous perennial herb found in grassy places by rivers, roads and railways, and on waste ground. 0-380 m (Glenlivet, Banffs.).|Native|This species was grown in medieval gardens as a medicinal or culinary herb, and escapes from cultivation are widely naturalised. For this reason it is often impossible to differentiate native plants from those of garden origin, and all those in Britain are mapped as if they are native; it is considered to be alien in Ireland (Scannell & Synnott, 1987).

Taraxacum|These tap-rooted perennial herbs occur in a very wide range of habitats, but prefer disturbed sites. Some microspecies are associated with natural or semi-natural habitats, including sand dunes, chalk grassland, fens, flushes and cliffs, but most occur in disturbed habitats such as pastures, roadside verges, lawns, tracks, paths and waste ground. 0?1220 m (Scotland).|Native|The distribution of Taraxacum agg. is stable. This taxonomically difficult genus comprises 229 apomictic microspecies in our area, of which over 40 are probably endemic and about 100 are alien. The introduced taxa are rarely recorded as such, and all records are mapped here as native.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element.
Taxus baccata|This evergreen tree is mainly a plant of well-drained calcareous soils, but occurs locally over acidic rocks. It grows in mixed deciduous woods on limestone and also forms pure stands; ancient woods of T. baccata occur on the chalk in S. England. It is very widely planted in churchyards, parks and large gardens, from where it seeds freely. 0-470 m (Purple Mt., S. Kerry).|Native|For the 1962 Atlas, only the presumed native distribution was mapped. However, native and alien records have proved impossible to separate, and all occurrences are mapped here as if they were native.|European Temperate element.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Teesdalia nudicaulis|A winter-annual of acidic, well-drained sandy soils on heathlands, sand dunes, shingle and gravels, on sandy lake shores in Ireland, by railways and on coal and cinder tips. It prefers bare or disturbed ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 455 m on Ben More (Mid Ebudes) and Wasdale Screes (Cumberland).|Native|T. nudicaulis has a very short-lived seed bank and this may have contributed to losses arising from scrub invasion and afforestation, as well as from urbanisation. Although most of the losses were before 1930, it has continued to decline in E. and N.E. England. It is now much better recorded in Scotland.|European Temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Tellima grandiflora|A very shortly rhizomatous perennial, growing in nitrogen-rich soils in damp woods and hedgerows. It is an established garden escape, setting copious seed. Lowland.|Neophyte|T. grandiflora was introduced to cultivation in Britain in 1826. It was recorded from the wild by 1908, and seems to be spreading.|Native of western N. America.
Tephroseris integrifolia||||
Tephroseris palustris|A biennial or short-lived perennial herb of pond margins and fen ditches; in Holland, it is known to be an early colonist of the bare mud on land newly reclaimed from the sea (polders). Lowland.|Native|T. palustris was first recorded in Britain in 1650 but had become extinct by the end of the 19th century. It was lost from Sussex in 1725, from the Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire fens by the early 1800s, and from the Norfolk Broads by the 1890s. Its last native record was from Dersingham (Norfolk) in 1899. Drainage and agricultural changes probably caused its demise at most sites.|Circumpolar Wide-boreal element.
Teucrium botrys|A biennial herb of bare ground within open grassland, arable field margins, and open fallow overlying chalk and limestone; occasionally recorded on spoil-tips and in disused quarries. Lowland.|Neophyte|T. botrys was cultivated in Britain by 1633 and first recorded in 1844 at Box Hill (Surrey), and has sometimes been considered to be native. It has declined since 1930 due to agricultural intensification, scrub encroachment and lack of grazing. However, it benefits from disturbance and at some sites thousands of plants have been recorded following cultivation or conservation management such as harrowing and turf cutting.|European Temperate element, but absent as a native from much of W.

Teucrium chamaedrys|This perennial herb is usually found on walls, rocks and dry banks. A population of small, almost prostrate, plants has been known in cliff-top chalk grassland at Cuckmere Haven (E. Sussex) since 1945, where it may be native (Rose, 1988). Lowland.|Neophyte|This species, first recorded in the wild in 1710, appears to be declining as a garden escape. The identity of extant populations needs to be checked as the normal garden plant is probably the hybrid T. chamaedrys x T. lucidum. Some populations are very long-lived; one has been known on a wall at Curry Mallet (S. Somerset) since 1922.|European Southern-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Teucrium scordium|This stoloniferous perennial herb has been recorded in a variety of wetland habitats with fluctuating water levels, including the margins of dune-slack pools, reed-fen, clay-pits and the banks of rivers, ponds and ditches. In Ireland it is often recorded from turloughs. Flowering and seed production can be poor. Lowland.|Native|The long-term decline of T. scordium in England, apparent from the 1962 Atlas, has continued as a result of drainage, reclamation and eutrophication of its wetland habitats. Although remaining populations are apparently stable, they are threatened by lack of management, scrub encroachment and shading. It is stable in Ireland.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element.
Teucrium scorodonia|A rhizomatous perennial herb of well-drained, acidic to mildly calcareous mineral soils, occurring in a wide range of habitats including woodland, hedgerows, scrub, heaths, limestone grassland and pavement, mountain ledges, dunes and shingle, and amongst Pteridium. 0-550 m (Pistyll Rhaeadr, Monts.).|Native|There is no evidence for a change in the range of T. scorodonia since the 1962 Atlas.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.
Thalictrum alpinum|A small, rhizomatous perennial of mountain habitats. It is found on damp rock ledges, at the open edges of stony streams and flushes and in thin grassland. It is a good indicator of substrates which are at least slightly base-rich. From sea level in N. Scotland, but generally above 300 m and reaching 1190 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|In Britain the distribution of T. alpinum is stable; in Ireland it has not been recorded recently at sites in Co. Antrim and Co. Down, despite searching, and further fieldwork is required to establish its current status elsewhere.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element, with a disjunct distribution.     © Pete Stroh
Thalictrum flavum|A rhizomatous perennial of fens, ditches and streamsides, and tall vegetation in wet meadows, always found where the substrate or water is base-rich. It is also recorded from open fen carr. Lowland.|Native|This handsome plant has declined since 1930 because of drainage and agricultural intensification on grazing marshes, and it is now often restricted to relict linear habitats such as river banks and roadside ditches. It can, however, still be locally abundant in unimproved wet grasslands with traditionally managed drainage systems.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Thalictrum minus|A morphologically variable, perennial herb found in calcareous or other base-rich habitats where competition is low, including fixed dunes, scrubby banks, rocky lake and river edges, limestone and serpentine cliffs, limestone grassland and pavement and montane rock ledges. It also occurs in other habitats, including churchyards, hedge banks and roadsides, as a garden escape. 0-855 m (Snowdon, Caerns.).|Native|The native distribution is stable, and much better recorded now than in the 1962 Atlas, but the species is apparently increasing as an alien in S. England.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.
Thelypteris palustris|A perennial fern of open or recently wooded fen or open carr, where the soil is permanently wet and organic, but not too acidic. It is a characteristic component of Phragmites-Cladium fen, but also persists as vigorous colonies in fen Alnus woods or Salix carr. Generally lowland, but formerly at 335 m (Braemar, S. Aberdeen).|Native|T. palustris declined before 1930 due to drainage, but it can be remarkably tenacious where natural succession has occurred, and has been re-found in several of its stations after many decades. There have been few losses since the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Temperate element, with a disjunct distribution.
Thesium humifusum|A perennial, with prostrate herbaceous shoots from a woody rootstock, which is hemiparasitic on the roots of various herbs. It is found in short, usually grazed, species-rich calcareous grassland, chiefly on chalk, less frequently on limestone, and rarely on clays or calcareous sandy soils near the coast. Little is known of its reproductive biology. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of this species is largely unchanged since the 1962 Atlas. Losses, most of which occurred before 1930, have resulted from the ploughing of downland, scrub encroachment and nutrient enrichment through fertiliser application, particularly in East Anglia. It was last recorded in Kent in 1963.|Oceanic Temperate element.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Thlaspi arvense|An annual found as an arable weed, particularly with broad-leaved crops and mainly on heavier soils. It is also a frequent weed on disturbed roadsides, and in waste places and gardens. Lowland, but there is a casual record at 330 m at Tomintoul (Banffs.).|Archaeophyte|T. arvense was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. The map suggests that it has increased in frequency in the north and west of its range since then.|As an archaeophyte T. arvense has a Eurasian Temperate distribution, but it is naturalised in N. America so its distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.     © L. Rooney
Thlaspi caerulescens|A perennial, or rarely biennial, herb almost confined in Britain to rocks or soils enriched with lead or zinc, being found on spoil heaps and mine waste and on metalliferous river gravels. It is also found, rarely, on outcrops and scree of limestone and other base-rich rocks, particularly in Scotland. Generally upland, reaching 940 m on Caenlochan (Angus), but descending to 100 m in Caernarvonshire.|Native|The distribution of T. caerulescens appears to be stable, although reworking of lead mine spoils may have destroyed some populations.|European Boreal-montane element, but absent from the Boreal zonobiome.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Thlaspi perfoliatum|An annual of bare or sparsely vegetated habitats on oolitic limestone, found on screes, stony banks and open pastures; also found in old quarries and on broken rocks. Elsewhere it is usually a casual of waste places, although populations have persisted on railway embankments. Lowland.|Native|T. perfoliatum has declined because of loss of open habitat due to scrub invasion, the lack of grazing or the cessation of quarrying. It has poor seed dispersal, and it has been suggested that many colonies away from the Cotswolds result from seed spread in the slipstream of trains.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Thuja plicata|An evergreen tree of parks and gardens, and of plantations, regenerating from seed freely when mature. It prefers fertile conditions, but will grow on chalk and other shallow, infertile soils. Lowland.|Neophyte|T. plicata was first introduced to Britain in 1853. It is very widespread as a decorative tree, but also locally in plantations, where it is used for under-planting hardwoods or larch. It was not recorded from the wild until 1954, and is increasing.|Native of western N. America.
Thymus polytrichus|A perennial herb of free-draining, calcareous or base-rich substrates, including chalk, limestone, sands and gravels. It occurs in short grassland on heaths, downland, sea-cliffs and sand dunes, and around rock outcrops and hummocks in calcareous mires. It is also frequent in upland grassland and on montane cliffs, rocks and ledges. 0-1125 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|T. polytrichus is still very common in suitable habitats. There is evidence for some losses in the southern part of its range since the 1962 Atlas.|European Boreo-temperate element.
Thymus pulegioides|A prostrate perennial herb of bare ground, short turf or coarse grassland on chalk, more rarely on sands and gravels on heaths and fixed dunes. It is more tolerant of competition than T. polytrichus. Lowland.|Native|This species was formerly confused with T. polytrichus, and the editors of the 1962 Atlas were cautious in accepting records that had not been verified by experts. There is less confusion now, and the species is better recorded. It has clearly declined at the edges of its range.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Thymus serpyllum|A small prostrate perennial herb confined to dry sandy heaths and grasslands overlying chalk drift, and on inland dunes, especially in areas disturbed by rabbits or sheep. Lowland.|Native|T. serpyllum was first recorded in 1773, but since then, many sites have been lost to forestry and cultivation. However, the recovery of rabbit populations and increase in sheep grazing has ensured the maintenance of suitable conditions at its remaining sites.|European Boreo-temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Tilia cordata|This tree occurs mostly in mixed deciduous Quercus or Fraxinus woodland on a wide range of soil types, and frequently on steep slopes and cliffs. Regeneration by seed occurs, mainly in S. England, but is rare. Vegetative reproduction is by shoots arising from fallen trees, or by layering, and it often occurs as an ancient coppiced tree. It has also been planted in parks and as a street tree. Generally lowland, but reaching c. 600 m in Cumbria.|Native|T. cordata is native in England and Wales but it is often planted inside and outside this range. All records are mapped as if they are native as further research is needed to establish the native distribution.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © L. Rooney
Tilia cordata x platyphyllos (T. x europaea)|This tree is native in a few woods with both parents, but it is mostly a planted tree. It is easily propagated from suckers, and is therefore common in woods, scrub, shelter-belts, avenues, copses, parkland, roadsides, and as an urban street tree. Generally lowland, but reaching 415 m near Nenthead (Cumberland).|Native|Two clones of this hybrid were widely planted in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and it remains a popular planted tree. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, and the current map indicates a stable distribution since then.|Occasional with the parents in Europe, but widely planted outside its native range.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Tilia platyphyllos|This species occurs as a native in old, mixed deciduous woodland on calcareous or, rarely, acidic soils, typically as a large tree or coppice stool. It also grows on cliff ledges, and as a planted tree on roadsides, in gardens, parkland and plantations. Seedlings are frequent, but saplings rare. Vegetative reproduction is by new shoots from the tree base. 0-400 m (Craig y Cilau, Brecs.).|Native|T. platyphyllos has been in cultivation since at least the 16th century, whence it has spread to semi-natural habitats, so that its native status can be doubtful in some areas. Its native distribution is stable. Planted trees were not mapped in the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.
Tofieldia pusilla|A rhizomatous, perennial herb growing by streams and in calcareous flushes, requiring constant moisture but not waterlogged conditions. Mainly upland, but from near sea level at Durness (W. Sutherland) to 975 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution of T. pusilla appears to be stable. Since the 1962 Atlas its known range in Scotland has increased slightly, and it may still be present in squares for which there are only pre-1987 records. It was discovered new to science in 1671 in Berwickshire, and recorded from Charnwood Forest (Leics.) in 1828.|Circumpolar Arctic-montane element.     © Pete Stroh
Tolmiea menziesii|A very shortly rhizomatous perennial, growing in nitrogen-rich soils in damp woods, by streams and other moist, shady places, occasionally on tips and waste ground. Some, or all, plants are self-incompatible and, especially if seed is lacking, the foliar embryos are likely to play an important role in their spread. Lowland.|Neophyte|Introduced in 1812 and grown as a house plant as well as in gardens, T. menziesii was recorded from the wild by 1928 and has become locally naturalised. It is increasing within its core areas. The species has two cytotypes, but it is not known whether our plants are diploid or tetraploid.|Native of western N. America.
Tordylium maximum|An annual or biennial herb of neutral grassland and in grassy thorn scrub, on clayey or alluvial soils. The sites are sheltered and S.-facing. Its seed is apparently short-lived. Lowland.|Neophyte|T. maximum was first recorded in Britain around 1670. It persisted in Middlesex until 1837, and was recorded at Tilbury (S. Essex), between 1875 and 1984. The current localities at Benfleet (S. Essex) were discovered in 1949 and 1966, where some populations have survived development and encroaching scrub, aided by seed collection and sowing in situ. T. maximum is treated here as a rare alien, but regarded as a possible native by Wigginton (1999).|Native from S. & S.C. Europe and N. Turkey to the Caucasus and N. Iran.
Torilis arvensis|An annual, rarely biennial, herb, almost exclusively found on arable land in autumn-sown cereals, but sometimes in other arable crops; also on waste and disturbed ground. It is perhaps most frequent on calcareous clays, but is found on a wide range of soils, including sands and gravels. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Once frequent, this species had already lost nearly half its sites by 1930, and since then its accelerating decline has been one of the most dramatic shown by any arable weed. It is a victim of intensive crop management, being vulnerable to herbicides and unable to compete in dense crop swards.|As an archaeophyte T. arvensis has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Torilis japonica|An annual, or rarely biennial, herb of dry neutral and basic soil, found in woodland margins, hedgerows, rough and rank grassland, and on roadside verges. 0-410 m (Craven Pennines, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|The distribution of T. japonica is little changed since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Torilis nodosa|An annual found in a wide range of dry, sparsely vegetated habitats, including open grassland, sunny banks, sea walls, cliff-tops, arable fields, tracks and waste ground; occasionally in disused sand- and gravel-pits, and on rubbish tips. Lowland.|Native|T. nodosa has declined since the 1962 Atlas in many inland areas, although it can be locally very abundant (Green et al., 1997). It is stable at most of its coastal sites, or even increasing, as in Dorset.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element, but naturalised north of its native range so that distribution is now Submediterranean-Subatlantic.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Tragopogon pratensis|An annual to perennial herb of tall grassland in meadows and pastures, on field margins, sand dunes, roadsides, railway banks and waste ground. 0-365 m (Buxton, Derbys.).|Native|The distribution of T. pratensis is almost unchanged since the 1962 Atlas. It tolerates occasional mowing, but with the decline of traditional hay meadows has become increasingly restricted to more disturbed habitats. The native subsp. minor occurs throughout the range of the species, the alien subsp. pratensis is mapped separately.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P.

Trichomanes speciosum||||
Trichophorum alpinum|A perennial herb, formerly known from the drier parts of a single bog in Angus. Lowland.|Native|In Britain, T. alpinum has only been recorded from the Moss of Restennet, where it was first discovered in 1791. It was extinct by about 1804, probably as a result of the extraction of marl from the site.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Trichophorum cespitosum|A densely tufted perennial herb occurring on peaty moors and bogs over acidic soils, persisting even in burnt and heavily deer-grazed areas. It is also local on open ground on wet lowland heaths in S. & E. England, where it often avoids the wettest sites and favours grazed, burnt and trampled areas. 0-1190 m (above Caenlochan, Angus).|Native|The decline of T. cespitosum in S. & E. England was already apparent in the 1962 Atlas, and has continued, but the distribution appears to be stable elsewhere. Two subspecies and their hybrid occur in our area; subsp. germanicum is found throughout the range of the species, subsp. cespitosum is mapped separately.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.     © P. Shannon
Trientalis europaea|A deciduous perennial herb of moist, acidic and humus-rich, but often fertile, soils in Betula, Pinus and Quercus woodland and on moorland; less commonly on heaths. It is highly localised, colonies often being separated by much apparently suitable ground. Seed-set is rare. It is a good competitor, but a poor colonist. Lowland to 1100 m at Cnap Coire na Spreidhe (Easterness).|Native|The distribution of T. europaea is unchanged in Scotland, but there has been a decline in N. England since the 1962 Atlas because of woodland clearance and moor-burning. It is now much better recorded on the North York Moors.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element, but absent from eastern N. America.
Trifolium arvense|An annual of open rocky or sandy habitats, such as acidic heathlands, sea-cliffs and sand dunes; also on railway ballast and waste ground inland and in disturbed grassland and set-aside fields on light, sandy soils. Lowland.|Native|T. arvense was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that the widespread decline in S.E. England has taken place since 1950.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Trifolium bocconei|A winter-annual of shallow soils over serpentine, or rarely schist, and favouring sheltered S.-facing summer-droughted grasslands near the sea. Lowland.|Native|This is the rarest of the Lizard clovers. It fluctuates in numbers with climatic variation but, as the critical factor is the need for open habitats, it is largely dependent on adequate levels of grazing. Its distribution is almost unchanged since 1960, when long-term monitoring of populations began. It is also rare in Jersey, where it has not been found at one of its two localities since rabbit numbers were reduced by myxomatosis.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Trifolium campestre|A winter-annual of grassland habitats on dry, relatively infertile neutral or base-rich soils, and thus more demanding and less frequent than T. dubium. It also occurs on spoil heaps from slate and limestone quarries. 0-350 m (Minninglow, Derbys.).|Native|T. campestre was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. The timing and causes of its apparent decline across parts of the north and west of its range are unclear.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Trifolium dubium|A winter-annual of hay meadows, waysides and waste places, and also frequent in lawns. Like T. campestre, it is most frequent in dry grasslands, but can be abundant too in winter-flooded meadows and damp pastures, and can thrive even in fairly nutrient-enriched situations. It also occurs in open habitats such as on rock outcrops, quarry spoil and railway ballast. Generally lowland, but reaching 530 m at Garrigill (Cumberland).|Native|There is no change in the distribution of T. dubium.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Trifolium fragiferum|A procumbent perennial herb, rooting at the nodes. On the coast it is found behind saltmarshes, on earthen sea-walls and grazing marshes. Inland it occurs in pastures or by tracks on damp alluvial or calcareous clay soils. It sometimes grows in long-established amenity grassland or lawns. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of T. fragiferum shows declines in some areas, largely due to the improvement of old pastures or their conversion to arable, although such losses do not always show at the 10-km scale (e.g. in Dorset). It is still frequent in its coastal habitats, despite the extensive draining and ploughing of grazing marshes.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Trifolium glomeratum|A winter-annual typically occurring in short open communities on light, drought-prone often somewhat acidic sandy or stony soils near the coast. Habitats include pathside banks, seafront lawns and cliff-slopes; also in sandy pastures, arable land and in the Isles of Scilly as a weed of bulb-fields. It is a rare casual inland. Lowland.|Native|The losses of T. glomeratum mostly date from before 1930. It now seems stable at its coastal sites, which are better recorded than for the 1962 Atlas, and, indeed, since it was last mapped on a national scale in 1994.|Mediterranean?Atlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Trifolium hybridum|An annual of grassy banks, meadows, roadsides and waste places. It is a frequent, often unintentional, constituent of seed mixtures, but rarely persists once a closed sward has developed. Its persistence in some areas probably relies on repeated introductions. 0-350 m at Stainmore (Westmorland).|Neophyte|T. hybridum used to be much grown as a forage crop and was recorded from the wild by 1762. It is still grown on a small scale as a green manure. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas, and its distribution is stable.|Native subspecies occur in S. Europe & S.W. Asia, especially in the mountains. Most of our plants are the cultivated subsp. hybridum, which is widely naturalised further north in Europe and elsewhere.     © Shannon, P
Trifolium incarnatum||||
Trifolium incarnatum subsp.incarnatum||||
Trifolium incarnatum subsp.molinerii|A winter-annual of schists, but not serpentine soils, on cliff-slopes in open habitats that are severely droughted in the summer. It has occurred as a casual at ports. Lowland and strictly maritime, only occurring within 200 m of the sea.|Native|In England, this subspecies still occurs at its five known localities on the Lizard peninsula (W. Cornwall), although population size varies considerably from year to year, depending on climatic conditions. In Jersey it also fluctuates in abundance in its best known site, an islet in Portelet Bay.|Mediterranean?Atlantic element.
Trifolium medium|A rhizomatous perennial herb, mostly found in neutral grasslands on heavy soils, although it also occurs in hedgerows and on wood edges, and in ruderal habitats such as quarry spoil-heaps and railway banks. In upland areas it is also found on rocky streamsides and in tall-herb communities on rock ledges, and on heaths in Ireland. Generally lowland, but reaching 610 m on Helvellyn (Cumberland).|Native|T. medium was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that the marked decline in S. and E. England has occurred since 1950, the loss of permanent pasture being the main cause.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Trifolium micranthum|A winter-annual of neutral or moderately acidic soils, found on the coast in open, sandy or gravelly grassland rich in annuals and inland in drought-prone pastures, on paths and verges, and as a weed in lawns. It is tolerant of grazing, mowing and heavy trampling. Generally lowland, but reaching 365 m near Bowes (N.W. Yorks.).|Native|T. micranthum is frequently confused with depauperate specimens of T. dubium, and the map may include such errors, but it is undoubtedly much better recorded than it was for the 1962 Atlas. Even allowing for this, however, it is likely that it has undergone a considerable increase in England and Wales since 1950.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Trifolium occidentale|A stoloniferous perennial herb of dry, species-rich coastal grasslands, often growing on cliff-slopes around rock outcrops, or on stabilised sand. It is largely restricted to exposed sites liable to drenching by salt-laden winds, and rarely occurs more than 100 m from the sea. Lowland.|Native|T. occidentale was discovered in 1957, and described as a new species from Cornwall and the Channel Islands in 1961; populations there appear to be stable. It was found in Ireland in 1979 and in Wales in 1987, and may have been overlooked elsewhere. The Cornish populations suffer heavy mortality in hot summers but subsequently recover from seed.|Oceanic Temperate element; restricted to the coast of W. Europe.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Trifolium ochroleucon|A perennial herb found on chalky boulder-clays or, more rarely, chalk, in pastures and on road verges, trackways and wood-borders. It also occurs as a casual outside its native core area. Lowland.|Native|T. ochroleucon is now rare in pastures, as large areas of suitable grassland have been converted to arable. Even in surviving grasslands there have been marked declines due to eutrophication, lack of grass cutting and encroachment of scrub. Many of its old roadside sites have been destroyed as a result of road-widening and re-routing schemes.|European Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Trifolium ornithopodioides|A winter-annual of acidic sands, gravels and compacted shingle, occurring on bare ground in disturbed, often much trampled places like car parks, tracks and paths, and occasionally in lawns and on heavily grazed commons. It prefers sites that are moist in winter and parched in summer. Lowland.|Native|This inconspicuous species has been under-recorded in the past and it is now much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas. Inland, it may be declining at some sites due to lack of management or building developments.|Suboceanic Southern-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Trifolium pratense|A perennial herb, native in a wide range of grasslands other than on the most acidic soils, and also common in waste places. The map includes the large, agriculturally selected variants (var. sativum) that are extensively sown into stubble and as components of short-term leys. 0-850 m (Scottish Highlands).|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of T. pratense since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Trifolium repens|A stoloniferous perennial herb, occurring in grasslands on all but the wettest or most acidic soils; also on waste ground and in other ruderal habitats. It is very tolerant of grazing, mowing and trampling and is often scarce or absent in taller grassland. It is very widely sown as a component of short and medium term leys, and on roadsides, and many commercial cultivars are available. Generally below 400 m, but reaching 880 m in the Breadalbanes (Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no change in the range of this ubiquitous species.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element, but widely naturalised so that distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.
Trifolium scabrum|A winter-annual of thin, infertile, drought-prone soils over limestone, sand and gravel; by the sea also in summer-parched cliff-top grasslands. It grows in similar habitats to T. striatum, and frequently grows with it, but tends to occupy rockier, drier and more strongly leached (acidic) microsites. Inland, it is also found on road verges. Lowland.|Native|Coastal populations of T. scabrum are largely stable, while inland losses mainly occurred before 1930 and may have involved casual plants.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Trifolium squamosum|An annual found in the dry, uppermost parts of saltmarshes, brackish meadows and by tidal rivers and creeks. It is rarely found inland in open grassland on calcareous soils, and as a casual of waste places and by railways. Lowland.|Native|Many sites for T. squamosum have been lost due to coastal developments, including sea-defence schemes, and a lack of grazing on coastal grasslands. Most losses occurred before 1930, but have continued since then, although it is fairly stable in its remaining sites.|Mediterranean?Atlantic element.     © L. Rooney
Trifolium striatum|A winter-annual occurring in short, open communities around rock outcrops and on thin, relatively infertile drought-prone soils. Habitats include well-drained pastures, grassy banks and road verges. Although often growing in acidic sites, it is also found on base-rich neutral or even highly calcareous soils. 0-320 m (Derbys.).|Native|Since the 1962 Atlas, some sites of T. striatum have been lost owing to the improvement or abandonment of pastures and other developments.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © L. Rooney
Trifolium strictum|A winter-annual of shallow soils over schists, basalt and serpentine, preferring rock outcrops and S.-facing cliff-slopes kept open by grazing and drought. The number of plants in a population can fluctuate annually; the seeds are long-lived and plants are most numerous in years following summer drought. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of T. strictum is stable in Britain. In the Channel Islands it is now restricted to one site in Jersey, while in Guernsey it has not been seen, despite searching, since 1933.|Submediterranean?Subatlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Trifolium subterraneum|A procumbent winter-annual found near the coast in open grassland or heathland on thin, free-draining neutral to acidic sands, gravels and shingle; inland it occurs in summer-parched grasslands on chalk and limestone. Lowland.|Native|Many inland sites for T. subterraneum were lost in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but since 1930 its distribution seems to have remained fairly stable. Robust alien variants were frequently recorded as casuals introduced with wool shoddy.|Submediterranean?Subatlantic element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Trifolium suffocatum|A winter-annual found on thin, dry soils on rocky coasts or on acidic compacted sand and shingle, either in open turf or on bare ground, and often part of a species-rich mosaic of annuals or bulbous plants. It occasionally grows on moister soils, but only in situations that are baked dry in summer. It was also a very rare alien of wool shoddy or spent tan. Lowland.|Native|Most inland populations of T. suffocatum were lost before 1930. There is little evidence of any change in its coastal distribution, where it was under-recorded until recently.|Mediterranean?Atlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Triglochin maritimum|A rhizomatous perennial herb of saline habitats. It is abundant in coastal and estuarine saltmarshes, flushed coastal rocks and cliff edges subject to sea spray, and the banks of tidal rivers. Inland, it occurs in brackish pastures as, for example, over saline Keuper beds in Cheshire, and at one site in Hampshire, in flushed turf on calcareous clay. Very rarely, it grows alongside salt-treated roads. Lowland.|Native|This species shows no appreciable change to its coastal range since the 1962 Atlas but has been lost from some of its few inland sites through habitat destruction.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element.     © Shannon, P
Triglochin palustre|This slender, perennial, rhizomatous herb occurs in open, damp, grassy or marshy places, often on calcareous substrates. Habitats include wet meadows and rush-pastures, heaths, fens, springs and flushes, saltmarsh fringes flushed with fresh water, and river shingle in upland areas. 0-970 m (Beinn Heasgarnich, Mid Perth).|Native|T. palustre is inconspicuous, and may sometimes be overlooked.

Trinia glauca|This monocarpic, dioecious perennial herb is restricted to dry limestone sites, typically occurring in short-grazed, open, species-rich turf on S.-facing slopes. In heavily grazed turf the plant can be perennial until the opportunity arises to flower. Reproduction is by seed. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of this species has not changed since the 1962 Atlas, and the national population appears to be stable. It persists at one alien site in N. Somerset.|European Southern-temperate element.
Tripleurospermum inodorum|An annual weed of arable fields, farm tracks and gateways, and on waste ground on a wide range of disturbed, fertile soils; also found on roadsides, railway ballast and spoil heaps. Generally lowland, but reaching 530 m in Atholl (E. Perth).|Archaeophyte|for species sens. lat. +0.31). There is a continuous archaeological record of T. inodorum from British sites from the Bronze Age onwards. It was not recognised as a full species distinct from T. maritimum until 1969 and the two taxa have not been distinguished by recorders in some areas. Its distribution is probably stable.|As an archaeophyte T. inodorum has a Eurosiberian Temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.

Tripleurospermum maritimum sens.lat.||||
Trisetum flavescens|A perennial of well-drained neutral and calcareous grassland, found in lowland pasture and hay meadows, on downland, banks and roadsides, and occasionally rocks. It is most abundant in old, ungrazed hay meadows. It is highly palatable to stock and susceptible to damage by heavy trampling. 0-550 m (Moor House, Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of T. flavescens is stable. It is alien in Shetland and its status is doubtful in other areas of N. and W. Scotland, and in N. Wales and S.W. England. The alien subsp. purpurascens appears to be widely sown in seed mixtures on verges and in grassland.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Triticum aestivum|A self-pollinating annual which occurs as a casual in cereal fields and in all manner of waste places, both as a residue of crops and as a bird-seed alien. Lowland.|Casual|T. aestivum is one of the commonest crops of lowland, arable land. It usually occurs as single plants, never persists, and is often ignored by recorders. It was not noted in the wild until 1927; cereal relics were rarely recorded before 1970, but must have been just as frequent then.|Not known as a wild plant; originated in cultivation and now grown in suitable climates throughout the world.
Trollius europaeus|A perennial herb of cool, damp habitats, including hay meadows, stream and river banks, lake margins, open woodland and rock ledges. It prefers basic soils, and is often associated with limestone. It is sensitive to grazing, but can persist as small, non-flowering plants in the uplands. 0-1005 m (Stuic, S. Aberdeen).|Native|The map clearly shows the decline of this species in Britain, especially at the fringes of its range, which began before 1930. The main cause is the agricultural improvement of hill land by drainage and the application of fertiliser.|European Boreal-montane element.     © P. Shannon
Tsuga heterophylla|An evergreen tree of plantations and large gardens, grown mainly in moist, sheltered sites. It sometimes regenerates abundantly from seed, but saplings seldom reach maturity. Generally lowland, but upper altitudinal limit unknown.|Neophyte|T. heterophylla was introduced to Britain in 1852, but not recorded from the wild until 1959 when it was recorded as regenerating vigorously in S. Somerset. It is very tolerant of shading, and was formerly often planted under hardwoods. However, it is susceptible to butt rot, and its timber is not in demand. It is widespread as an amenity tree, but more frequent in Scotland in forestry plantations. It is under-recorded.|Native of western N. America.
Tuberaria guttata|An autumn- and spring-germinating annual found in bare patches of thin, dry soil overlying hard igneous rock in open areas within wind-cut heath near the sea. In Ireland it sometimes grows in areas where burning has taken place the previous year. It may occur with a sparse growth of other small annuals, and is typically found in lichen-rich communities. Lowland.|Native|Although T. guttata varies greatly in numbers from year to year, its overall distribution is stable. Most populations are small but show very high levels of genetic variation and diversity.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.
Tussilago farfara|A rhizomatous perennial herb, occurring, often as a pioneer, in a wide range of moist or dry, often disturbed habitats, which include sand dunes and shingle, slumping cliff-slopes, landslides, spoil heaps, seepage areas, rough grassland, crumbling river banks, waste places and roadside verges. It can also be a troublesome arable weed. 0-1065 m in the Breadalbanes (Mid Perth).|Native|The distribution has shown little overall change since the 1962 Atlas. It is alien in Shetland, where it was first recorded in 1841.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © M. Cotterill, IWNHAS
Typha angustifolia|This tall, rhizomatous perennial grows as an emergent in mesotrophic or eutrophic water in lakes, ponds, ditches and flooded mineral workings. It tends to grow in deeper water than T. latifolia, and tolerates mesotrophic as well as eutrophic conditions. It also grows as floating rafts at some sites. Lowland.|Native|There is little evidence for any change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas. It is often cultivated as an ornamental aquatic, and some populations may have arisen from garden escapes.|Eurosiberian Temperate element; also in N. America.     © C. Eccleston, IWNHAS
Typha latifolia|A rhizomatous perennial growing as an emergent in shallow water or on exposed mud at the edge of lakes, ponds, canals and ditches and (less frequently) by streams and rivers. It favours nutrient-rich sites. It spreads by wind-dispersed fruits, often colonising newly excavated ponds and ditches and subsequently spreading by vegetative growth. 0-500 m (Brown Clee Hill, Salop).|Native|There is some evidence that T. latifolia increased in frequency in the 20th century in many areas, for reasons that are not entirely clear. It is now much more frequently recorded in Wales, N. England and Scotland than it was in the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element.     © P. Shannon
Ulex europaeus|A shrub of mildly acidic soils, including leached soils on chalk and limestone, and acidic sands and gravels. It occurs in under-grazed pastures, woodland rides, on sea-cliffs and sand dunes, and on waste ground and railways. It is sometimes planted as hedges or game-shelter, and on roadsides. Generally lowland, but reaching 640 m on Carnedd Dafydd (Caerns.).|Native|U. europaeus has increased in abundance with the increase of ruderal habitats and the relaxation of grazing on lowland heaths and cliff-tops since the 1930s.

Ulex gallii|A shrub of heaths on infertile acidic soils, including leached soils overlying chalk and limestone; also found on sea-cliffs, in under-grazed or abandoned pastures, and on scrubby banks and waste ground. Generally lowland, but reaching 670 m in Macgillycuddy`s Reeks (S. Kerry).|Native|The distribution of U. gallii is probably stable, despite local losses from grazing pressures. The boundary between the range of this species and that of U. minor is remarkably sharp, other than in Dorset, but there has been much mis-recording. There are new records for N. Scotland, where it may have been sown beside newly-made roads or, flowering late in the year, may previously have been overlooked.|Oceanic Temperate element.
Ulex minor|A small, sometimes procumbent shrub of heaths on free-draining acidic, nutrient-poor soils over podsolised sands and gravels, and occasionally over superficial deposits overlying chalk. In heathland areas it can persist as an under-storey shrub in scrub and secondary woodland. It also occurs on undergrazed heathy pastures and, rarely, on wet heaths. Lowland.|Native|Whilst there has been little overall decline, many sites for U. minor have been lost to development and forestry, and to increasing scrub where grazing has ceased. Alien records have increased in Britain and Ireland; some of these may result from its use in seed mixtures for roadsides.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Ulmus glabra|U. glabra is a largely non-suckering tree of hedges, field-borders and streamsides, but also forms mixed or pure woodland, especially on limestone and other base-rich soils. It is also a colonist of ungrazed grassland, rocky ground and waste and spoil heaps, and is also planted. 0?530 m (Atholl, E. Perth).|Native|In C. and S. England, U. glabra hybridises freely, especially with U. minor, and some intermediates may have been mis-recorded as U. glabra. Although more resistant to Dutch Elm disease than U. procera, most mature trees outside Scotland have now been killed. The native status of many records is questionable.|European Temperate element.     © H. Higgins, IWNHAS
Ulmus minor||||
Ulmus plotii|A distinctive narrow tree formerly lending a characteristic appearance to the landscape in its native area, where it occurs in hedgerows and field-borders. It is particularly common on neutral to base-rich soils in the English E. Midlands, mostly in moist, deep-soiled river valleys. Lowland.|Native|Few mature trees remain, being very susceptible to the current outbreak of Dutch Elm disease which began c. 1965, and new sapling growth still succumbs after a few years. It was apparently declining even before that disease, but it remains a major hedgerow constituent in its native area. Hybrids with U. minor and U. glabra are common.|Endemic.
Ulmus procera|A large wide-topped tree, often considered a definitive component of the English countryside, found in hedgerows and field-borders, rarely in woodland but sometimes forming small copses. It prefers the deep and moist soils of major river systems. Lowland.|Native|In most areas few mature trees remain, being very susceptible to the current outbreak of Dutch Elm disease which began c. 1965. New sapling growth still succumbs, but the species remains a major hedgerow constituent, particularly in its core area. The natural distribution is much confused by planting, but probably does not extend much beyond England and Wales. Hybrids with other Ulmus taxa are infrequent.|European Temperate element.
Umbilicus rupestris|A perennial herb, growing on walls, in rock crevices and on stony hedge banks, mainly on acidic substrates. In Cornwall it has even been seen growing as an epiphyte on the boughs of large trees. 0-550 m (Berwyn Mountains near Pistyll Rhaiadr, Monts.).|Native|This species is still predominantly western and shows little change in distribution since the 1962 Atlas, in which it was mapped as `all records`. Some records in E. England are introductions, as for example in Norfolk where it is assumed to have been planted.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © P. Shannon
Urtica dioica|A rhizomatous and stoloniferous perennial herb occurring in a wide range of habitats, including woods, scrub, unmanaged grasslands, fens, river banks, hedgerows, roadsides, manure heaps, cultivated and waste ground. It prefers damp, nutrient-rich soils. 0-850 m (Great Dun Fell, Westmorland).|Native|Since the 1950s, U. dioica seems to have increased, perhaps due to the widespread use of artificial fertilisers, but this is not obvious at the 10-km scale. A pubescent, stingless form from fens and carr has been referred to U. galeopsifolia.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © C. Gibson
Urtica urens|A spring-germinating annual of well-tilled arable land, especially fields of broad-leaved crops, and also allotments, gardens, farmyards and waste ground. It prefers light, often sandy, soils of high fertility. Generally lowland, but reaching 500 m in E. Allendale (S. Northumb.).|Archaeophyte|There has been little change in the distribution of U. urens since the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`.|As an archaeophyte U. urens has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution, but it is widely naturalised so that its distribution is now Circumpolar Southern-temperate.     © C.

Utricularia australis|A species mainly of acidic water, found in lakes, ponds, reservoirs, slow-flowing streams, ditches, canals, and swampy ground over mineral or peaty soil. It also occurs, however, in moderately calcareous sites. Generally lowland, but reaching 335 m on Lambrigg Fell (Westmorland), and probably at 500 m in Llyn Anafon (Caerns.).|Native|The map is based mainly on flowering plants, which, since most flowering is in the south, must give it a southern bias and greatly underestimate the range. Distributional change is difficult to assess, though it has decreased in lowland England.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element.
Utricularia intermedia sens.lat.|Perennial, insectivorous herbs, most frequent in shallow, oligotrophic water in acidic and peaty sites, though also occurring in calcareous sites. They rarely flower, and reproduction is mainly by turions. 0?650 m (Loch Achlarich, Mid Perth).|Native|A poorly-known complex of three species, U. intermedia sens. str., U. ochroleuca and U. stygia, for which there are rather few reliable records. The aggregate has declined, especially in the southern part of its range, due to habitat destruction and eutrophication. It is, however, much better recorded in Scotland and Ireland than in the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Utricularia intermedia sens.str.||||
Utricularia minor|A perennial herb of nutrient-poor, acidic, or sometimes base-rich, shallow water in bog pools and abandoned peat cuttings, at the edges of lakes amongst emergent vegetation, in ditches and small ponds, and in fens. 0-600 m (Haystacks Tarn, Cumberland), and possibly to 685 m in Scotland.|Native|U. minor is free-flowering, and can be reliably identified on both flowering and vegetative characters. A decline was apparent in the 1962 Atlas, and this has continued in S. and E. England, and perhaps also in S.E. Ireland, due to habitat destruction and eutrophication.

Utricularia vulgaris sens.lat.|Free-floating, insectivorous perennials found in still or sluggish, acidic to basic, nutrient-poor waters over inorganic or peaty substrates. Flowering is irregular, and reproduction is usually by turions. Generally lowland, but reaching 640 m in Atholl (E. Perth).|Native|This aggregate, which comprises U. australis and U. vulgaris, is much better recorded in Scotland and N. Ireland than it was in the 1962 Atlas. It has declined in many areas, mainly due to drainage, peatland destruction and eutrophication.

Vaccinium microcarpum|This trailing dwarf shrub occurs exclusively in Sphagnum mires, generally forming colonies in the drier microhabitats including the tops of hummocks. It ascends from near sea level in N.E. Scotland to 850 m on Carn nan Tri-tighearnan (Easterness).|Native|There has probably been no significant change in the distribution of V. microcarpum, the apparent widening of its range since the 1962 Atlas being attributed to better recording now that its taxonomy is better understood.|Circumpolar Boreal-montane element.
Vaccinium myrtillus|A calcifugous low shrub, common and locally dominant in well-drained heaths and moorland, especially in upland areas, and as an understorey in acid woodland of Betula, Pinus and Quercus; also found on hummocks in peat bogs in the north and west. It rarely regenerates from seed. 0-1300 m (Ben Macdui, S. Aberdeen).|Native|V. myrtillus was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that the declines from the edge of its range in England have occurred since 1950, reflecting the loss of lowland heathland. It has also declined in C. Ireland, probably for the same reasons. Elsewhere it remains common in suitable habitats.|Eurosiberian Boreal-montane element.     © P. Shannon
Vaccinium oxycoccos|A slender, trailing dwarf shrub found in bogs and on very wet heaths, usually creeping amongst Sphagnum. 0-760 m (Ben Macdui, S.

It spreads vegetatively by prostrate stems which root at the nodes; reproduction from seed appears to be comparatively rare. 0-750 m (Meal na Teanga, Loch Lochy, Westerness), with an unlocalised record of 820 m elsewhere in the Scottish Highlands.|Native|There has been no change in the distribution of V. chamaedrys since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © C. Gibson
Veronica filiformis|A perennial herb of lawns and churchyards, and also found on roadsides, paths, grassy banks and streamsides. It is self-incompatible, rarely setting seed in our area but often spreads from fragments after mowing. Generally lowland, but reaching 450 m at Nenthead (Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species was certainly cultivated in Britain by 1808 but was not widely grown until the 20th century. It was first recorded in the wild in 1838 but not reported again until 1927. Thereafter it spread rapidly, and was widespread at the time of the 1962 Atlas. Since then it has further increased and greatly consolidated its range.|Native of N. Turkey and the Caucasus.
Veronica fruticans|A small, rather woody perennial, restricted to calcareous substrates and occurring on dry open slopes and rock ledges on crags, in sites which are usually S.-facing and inaccessible to grazing animals. Montane, from 540 m (Meal an Fhiodhain, Mid Perth) to 1100 m (Ben Lawers, Mid Perth).|Native|It is uncertain whether the distribution of V. fruticans is stable. Some populations are known to have been lost, for reasons which are uncertain, and the numbers of plants at extant sites are small. The additional 10-km square records since the 1962 Atlas can probably be ascribed to better recent recording.|European Arctic-montane element; also in Greenland.     © Pete Stroh
Veronica hederifolia|An annual of cultivated and waste ground, woodland rides, hedge banks, walls, banks and gardens, found on sandy, loam or clay soils. V. hederifolia seeds freely, with germination in spring or autumn. 0-380 m (Malham Moor, Mid-W. Yorks.).|Archaeophyte|The distribution and frequency of V. hederifolia remains stable. Two cytologically distinct subspecies occur in our area and are mapped separately.|As an archaeophyte V. hederifolia has a European Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Veronica montana|A perennial herb of damp basic to mildly acidic soils in long-established, mixed deciduous woodland, scrub and shaded hedge banks. It is found on loamy and sandy soils and on heavy clay. Generally lowland, but reaching 435 m at Pont y Daf (Brecs.).|Native|The distribution of V. montana is little changed since the 1962 Atlas, although it is now better recorded in W. Scotland.|European Temperate element.     © C. Gibson
Veronica officinalis|This perennial herb is found in open woods and woodland rides, on banks, in grassland and on heathland. It grows on well-drained, often moderately acidic or leached soils, and in some grasslands is confined to raised ground or anthills. 0-880 m (Cadair Idris, Merioneth).|Native|The broad distribution of V. officinalis is little changed, though there have clearly been local declines where its habitats have been lost, particularly in the English Midlands. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.|European Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © C. Gibson
Veronica persica|An annual of arable fields, other cultivated areas and waste ground, found on a wide range of fertile soils. It is self-fertile and seeds prolifically, the seeds forming a persistent seed bank and germinating throughout the year. It also spreads vegetatively from stem fragments. 0-350 m (Alston, Cumberland).|Neophyte|This species was first recorded in the wild in 1826 and rapidly extended its range during the 19th century. It remains frequent even in arable fields.|Probably native to mountains of the Caucasus & N. Iran, where it may have originated by the hybridisation of V. ceratocarpa and V. polita. Widespread as a weed in Europe, N. Africa, N. America, Japan and New Zealand.     © C. Gibson
Veronica polita|An annual of cultivated fields and gardens, typically growing on light, sandy, often calcareous soils. Generally lowland, but reaching 350 m near Kaber (Westmorland).|Neophyte|V. polita was first recorded from the wild in Britain in 1777. Its distribution now seems stable in S. & E. England and Wales, but appears to be declining in N. England, Scotland and Ireland. It was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas.|A Eurosiberian Southern-temperate species.     © G. Toone, IWNHAS
Veronica praecox|An annual found naturalised on free-draining sandy soils, usually where there is regular disturbance. Habitats include the edges of arable fields, on tracks, sandy banks, and open rough grassland. Lowland.|Neophyte|This species was grown in Britain in 1775. It was not recorded from the wild until 1933, and has only ever been known at a few sites. Numbers in individual populations can fluctuate greatly, and it is vulnerable to herbicides. It is less common in Breckland than at the time of the 1962 Atlas, although it has been successfully introduced to new sites.|A European Southern-temperate species, absent as a native from much of W. Europe.
Veronica scutellata|This perennial herb is found in a wide range of wetland habitats, including pond and lake margins, marshes, fens and fen-meadows, wet grassland, hillside flushes, bogs and wet heath, often on acidic soils. It occurs in both open habitats and amongst tall vegetation. 0-780 m on Cross Fell (Cumberland).|Native|V. scutellata is now much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas, where it was mapped as `all records`. The current map shows widespread declines, especially in C. & S. England and C. Ireland. Analysis of the database reveals that these losses have occurred since 1950.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; also in N. America and widely naturalised outside its native range.     © C. Gibson
Veronica serpyllifolia|A low perennial herb with creeping and rooting stems. It is widespread in both natural and artificial habitats, including woodland rides, grassland, heaths, flushes, damp rock ledges, cultivated land, lawns, waste ground and damp paths. 0-1160 m (Braeriach, S. Aberdeen).|Native|The range of V. serpyllifolia is stable. Subsp. serpyllifolia occurs throughout the range of the species up to altitudes of 825 m (Cross Fell, Cumberland); subsp. humifusa is mapped separately.|Circumpolar Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © P. Shannon
Veronica spicata|A perennial herb of well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. In East Anglia, subsp. spicata usually grows on acidic to base-rich sandy soils in open, shortly-grazed grassland. Elsewhere, subsp. hybrida grows in thin soils on base-rich cliffs, grassland and rocks. Generally lowland, but reaching 400 m in Ribblesdale (Mid-W. Yorks.).|Native|The distribution of V. spicata is stable, though there have been losses of subsp. spicata, especially before 1930. The two subspecies may not be distinct and are not formally distinguished by Stace (1997) or recognised in Flora Europaea (Tutin et al., 1972).|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © C. Gibson
Veronica triphyllos|Recently, this annual of sandy calcareous or slightly acidic soils has been found on the margins of arable fields and on sandy banks, but it was formerly also known from tracks, fallow fields, gravel-pits and waste ground. Regular disturbance is needed to maintain sufficient open ground for germination. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|V. triphyllos was first recorded in Britain in 1670, and it has been long-established in Breckland. Its main decline took place before 1930, and since the 1962 Atlas it has been confined to very few sites. Conservation management is ensuring its survival at remaining sites.|As an archaeophyte V. triphyllos has a European Temperate distribution, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Veronica verna|An annual of infertile sandy soils, occurring in short grassland and uncultivated, sometimes stony, places including rabbit warrens. V. verna does not occur on cultivated land, but depends on intensive grazing by sheep or rabbits to keep its habitat open. Lowland.|Native|Unlike V. praecox and V. triphyllos, V. verna is a plant of semi-natural habitats in Breckland and is therefore considered native. It has declined considerably, and is now found in only twelve sites in two 10-km squares. It has been introduced to two reserves, where it is flourishing.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © A. Brown
Viburnum lantana|A deciduous shrub, found in woodland, scrub and hedgerows, especially on base-rich soils. It is particularly characteristic of chalk and limestone districts. It is now frequently planted on roadsides and may also appear when used as a stock for other cultivated species of Viburnum (Stace, 1997). Lowland.|Native|The native distribution of V. lanata is little changed since the 1962 Atlas, though local losses have occurred. There are now many more alien records, and the northern limits of its range have become blurred due to these. The status of some populations can be difficult to determine.|European Temperate element.     © C. Gibson
Viburnum opulus|This deciduous shrub of neutral or calcareous soils is found in woodland, scrub and hedgerows, in fen carr and Alnus and Salix thickets, and on stream banks, favouring damp places, but also found in dry habitats. It is planted in parks and gardens and plants which spread from these sites to the wild sometimes include yellow-fruited cultivars (Lousley, 1976a). 0-400 m (south of Garrigill, Cumberland).|Native|The distribution of V. opulus is similar to that shown in the 1962 Atlas.|Circumpolar Temperate element.     © C. Gibson
Vicia bithynica|A scrambling annual found in rough grassland on coastal undercliffs, and inland in open hedges, scrubby grassland and on railway banks. At many inland sites it was probably introduced as a contaminant of legume crops, but can be persistent along hedges and tracksides. Lowland.|Native|V. bithynica appears to have declined in several of its coastal sites, which are now much more overgrown than previously. The status of some inland populations is uncertain, and it is possible that more of these could be native than are shown on the map.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Vicia cracca|A scrambling perennial herb of hedgerows, waysides, wood-borders, scrubby grassland and river and canal banks. It also occurs in permanent pastures and hay meadows, and in marshes and tall-herb fens, but avoids permanently wet sites. Generally lowland, but reaching 550 m at Moor House, Teesdale (Westmorland).|Native|The distribution of this species has remained unchanged since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurasian Boreo-temperate element, but naturalised in N. America so distribution is now Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.     © C. Gibson
Vicia faba|A robust annual occurring on waste ground, set-aside fields and rubbish tips. Most populations are casual. Lowland.|Neophyte|V. faba, cultivated in the Middle East for eight thousand years, spread to W. Europe by the second millennium bc. Seeds from the Iron Age have been found in deposits at Glastonbury and it has been grown in British gardens since 1200 (Harvey, 1981). It is widely grown as a vegetable and increasingly as a fodder crop, and is frequently found as an escape from cultivation. Small-seeded variants are introduced with bird-seed.|As V. faba is not known as a wild plant, it presumably originated by selection in cultivation.
Vicia hirsuta|A scrambling annual of rough and disturbed ground, including road and railway banks, scrubby grassland, hedgerows, sheltered sea-cliffs and consolidated shingle beaches; also along the edges of arable fields, and on rubbish tips and waste ground. 0-335 m (Dartmoor, S. Devon).|Native|There has been no discernible change in the distribution of V. hirsuta since the 1962 Atlas. It was a troublesome cornfield weed in the 19th century, but is now much less frequent in that habitat.|European Temperate element, but widely naturalised so distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.     © C.

Vicia lathyroides|An annual of sand dunes and short, summer-parched grasslands on sandy soils by the coast; also on disturbed ground, old walls, and in dry heathland on sands and gravels inland. Lowland.|Native|V. lathyroides is easily overlooked because of its small size and early-flowering, but in some areas may also have been over-recorded for dwarf forms of V. sativa subsp. nigra, with which it often grows. However, it is very much better recorded than it was for the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.     © Peter Llewellyn
Vicia lutea|An annual found as a native in a variety of coastal habitats, including scrubby grassland and cliffs, and on open yet consolidated shingle. In S. Scotland it is confined to sheltered sea-cliffs. Inland it is found as a casual, or sometimes in persistent populations, on roadsides, quarries and railway banks. Lowland.|Native|The native distribution of V. lutea is probably stable. However, it can be difficult to separate alien and native records on the coast, which may mask any changes in the distribution of native populations. The current map indicates an overall decline in alien occurrences.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Vicia orobus|A perennial herb of grassy, often slightly base-enriched habitats on banks and the edges of fields, particularly amongst stones, boulders or bushes. Usually between 200 and 300 m, but down to sea level in Sutherland, and reaching 455 m on the Wast Water screes (Cumberland).|Native|This species is adversely affected by overgrazing and undergrazing, both of which have contributed to its decline, though losses have also resulted from grassland improvement and land reclamation. Britain has a significant proportion of the world population of this species.|Suboceanic Temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Vicia parviflora|A scrambling annual of sticky calcareous clay soils which are frequently wet in winter but baked dry in summer. V. parviflora occurs in hedgerows, on tracks and verges, grassy banks, coastal cliffs and the edges of arable fields; also, less frequently, on urban waste ground, in municipal flower beds and as a casual of legume crops. Lowland.|Native|There is evidence of a widespread decline of this species in its arable habitats, commencing before 1930 but still continuing. It may have been overlooked or over-recorded previously due to confusion with V. tetrasperma. Its distribution in other habitats remains stable.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Vicia sativa|An annual of grassy and wayside places, particularly on dry and sandy sites. It was also grown as a fodder crop, and has widely escaped and become naturalised in many ruderal habitats. Lowland.|Native|There is little change in the distribution of V. sativa since the 1962 Atlas. Three subspecies are found in our area (subsp. nigra, subsp. segetalis and subsp. sativa) and these are mapped separately. The map overestimates the native distribution as subsp. nigra has been over-recorded as a native at inland sites.|European Southern-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © Shannon, P
Vicia sepium|A climbing or scrambling perennial herb of hedge banks, waysides, wood-borders and lightly grazed grasslands. In upland areas it favours more open, ungrazed situations but it is most frequently found on neutral or basic soils. Generally lowland, but reaching 820 m in Caenlochan (Angus).|Native|V. sepium shows no change in its overall distribution since the 1962 Atlas.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © C. Gibson
Vicia sylvatica|A climbing or scrambling perennial of hedges, wood-borders and clearings, scrub, rough ungrazed grassland on cliffs, wooded gorges and also on shingle, screes and railway bank. A genetically dwarf variant (var. condensata) occurs on shingle and coastal cliffs in N. & W. Britain and Ireland. 0-675 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|V. sylvatica is much better recorded than in the 1962 Atlas, but there have been losses across much of its range and many county floras report local declines. It needs light in its woodland edge habitat so a decline in coppicing might be affecting its abundance.|Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate element.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Vicia tetrasperma|A scrambling annual of hedgerows, scrub and wood-borders, and of rough grassland on roadsides, railway banks and coastal cliffs; also found in disturbed places, including urban waste ground and arable field margins. Lowland.|Native|There appears to be little change in the distribution of V. tetrasperma since the 1962 Atlas, but county floras report declines throughout the range. The status of some records in N.W. England and Scotland is uncertain.|European Temperate element, but widely naturalised so distribution is now Circumpolar Temperate.     © C. Gibson
Vicia villosa|A scrambling annual, usually derived from grain, bird-seed or wool shoddy imports, and occurring as a casual on waste ground, tips and in arable fields. It sometimes survives for a few years on grassy banks. Lowland.|Neophyte|V. villosa was first grown in Britain in 1815, but arose in the wild as a grain contaminant in 1857. Trends in its distribution are unclear.|A variable, European Southern-temperate species which is absent as a native from much of N.W. Europe.     © C. Gibson
Vinca major|A perennial herb of waste places, rubbish tips, roadside verges, shaded banks and woodland. Lowland.|Neophyte|V. major was being cultivated in Britain by 1597. It is widely grown as a ground-cover species, but its robust habit and vigorous growth means that it is frequently discarded, and often becomes well-established in suitable habitats. It was recorded from the wild by 1650 (Middlesex). It has increased since the 1962 Atlas, probably mostly due to continued dumping of garden material, although it is also likely to be better recorded.|The naturalised plant, subsp. major, is a native of the European Mediterranean region; subsp. hirsuta is native to N. Turkey and the Caucasus.     © C. Gibson
Vinca minor|A perennial herb of woodland, roadside banks and verges, waste places and rubbish tips. Generally lowland, but reaching 380 m at Glenlivet (Banffs.).|Archaeophyte|This species is similar to V. major but, being smaller and less invasive, is more widely cultivated and therefore more frequent as an escape. It was grown in gardens in Britain by 995 (Harvey, 1981). There has been an increase in records since the 1962 Atlas, probably due to a genuine increase as well as better recording.|Apparently native to S., W. & C. Europe, C. & S. Russia and the Caucasus, but the limits of the native range have been obscured by its spread in cultivation.     © C. Gibson
Viola arvensis|Coming soon|Conservation Status|Coming soon|No map available
Viola canina|A perennial herb of a variety of acid habitats, including heaths, coastal dunes, stony riversides and lake shores, especially in Scotland. It can also occur on thin, heavily leached substrates overlying chalk and (as subsp. montana) in fens. 0?425 m (Isla, E. Perth).|Native|This species has declined severely since 1950, mainly due to habitat loss, drainage and agricultural improvement, but also over- and under-grazing and possibly hybridisation with other Viola species. It may also be overlooked for V. riviniana.

Viola hirta|A perennial herb, occurring mainly on calcareous soils, and found in short grassland or open scrub on downland, rocky slopes, limestone pavement, woodland borders and rides, and sometimes on base-flushed but more acidic riverside substrates; also on roadsides and railway banks. Generally lowland, but reaching 610 m on Long Fell (Westmorland).|Native|V. hirta shows some decline throughout its range, largely through habitat loss to agricultural or other development.|Eurosiberian Temperate element.     © C. Gibson
Viola kitaibeliana|A tiny annual of short coastal turf, open disturbed areas on sandy soils, open sand on eroding coastal dunes, around rabbit burrows, and arable fields. It can also grow under the shelter of coastal Pteridium in the Isles of Scilly, and in thin soil on granite sea-cliffs in Guernsey. Lowland.|Native|The 10-km distribution of this species is stable. However, several sites have been lost in the Isles of Scilly since the 1950s, and others are threatened by coastal erosion, building development and by coarse vegetation. Colonies have been known to re-appear on former sites following disturbance, suggesting the presence of a persistent seed bank.|European Southern-temperate element.     © C. Gibson
Viola lactea||||
Viola lutea|A perennial herb of grazed grassland on hill-slopes and banks, and on rock ledges. Although usually found on calcareous rocks, it is a mild calcifuge, preferring leached soil but avoiding very acidic sites; it also grows on metalliferous soils. In W. Ireland it occurs on coastal dunes. Mainly upland, reaching 1050 m (Breadalbanes, Mid Perth).|Native|V. lutea has declined since the 1962 Atlas due to agricultural improvement. Its confirmation from Somerset in 1990, where it was first reported in 1901, represents a significant extension of its British range. Irish dune populations have some characteristics of V. tricolor subsp. curtisii.|European Boreal-montane element, but absent from the Boreal zonobiome.     © K.J. Walker, BSBI
Viola odorata|A perennial herb, usually found on calcareous or other base-rich soils. Its habitats include open woodlands, hedge banks and scrub, and less frequently shady road and railway banks and verges. Alien populations are naturalised in churchyards and elsewhere. Reproduction is by seed and by rooting stolons. Lowland.|Native|The distribution appears to be stable. In the north and west of its British range many plants are alien, and it may not be native north of Westmorland and Durham. In Ireland it is probably alien in the north and west; elsewhere its status is often uncertain and the map probably overstates the native sites.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.     © C.

Viola palustris|A perennial herb of bogs, wet heaths, marshes, Alnus and Salix carr and wet woods, especially on acidic soils where there is some flushing. It is frequently associated with Sphagnum, and is also found in non-calcareous dune-slacks. 0-1220 m (Ben Macdui, S. Aberdeen).|Native|V. palustris was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. Analysis of the database reveals that the losses in S. & E. England and C. Ireland have taken place since 1950; they are mostly due to agricultural improvement and peat extraction.

Viola persicifolia|A perennial herb found in Britain on damp peaty or clayey, base-rich soils in seasonally wet fens, and in Ireland on the margins of turloughs. It is a poor competitor, preferring areas subject to fluctuating water levels, cattle trampling or peat-digging. Seed is long-lived. Lowland.|Native|V. persicifolia was lost from many sites before 1930. It survives at Wicken Fen and Woodwalton Fen (Cambs.), but its management at Wicken has proved to be difficult. It was thought to be extinct at Otmoor (Oxon), but a small population was found in 1997. Its distribution in Ireland is stable.|Eurosiberian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.     © C. Gibson
Viola reichenbachiana|This perennial herb is found in deciduous woodland and hedge banks, usually in moderately shaded situations but also in the open where it can sometimes persist following woodland clearance. It is most frequent on calcareous soils, being particularly common in woods over limestone and chalk or base-rich clays. Generally lowland, but formerly reaching 610 m as an alien in Mid Perthshire.|Native|There has been little change in the distribution of this species since the 1962 Atlas, although there are some losses at the north of its range.|European Temperate element.     © C. Gibson
Viola riviniana|This perennial herb occurs in a wide range of habitats, including open deciduous woodland, hedge banks and road verges, meadows, heaths, moorland, mountain grassland, rocky slopes and cliff ledges; it can become a serious weed in gardens. It avoids wet areas but is generally indifferent to soil type, shunning only the most acidic habitats. 0-1020 m (Stuchd an Lochain, Mid Perth).|Native|There has been no significant change in the distribution of V. riviniana since the 1962 Atlas.|European Temperate element.     © C. Gibson
Viola rupestris|This shy-flowering perennial occurs in exposed, dry, open limestone grassland, invariably on bare or eroded slopes or hummock-tops. From 140 m on Arnside (Westmorland) to 600 m on Long Fell (Westmorland).|Native|Significant populations of V. rupestris were discovered in the Craven Pennines by Roberts (1977). However, colonies were lost on Widdybank Fell (Durham) through erosion and when a reservoir was completed in 1970, and have been reduced at Arnside through trampling and under-grazing. Some remaining colonies, however, are very large. Contrary to some claims, it is not being ousted by the hybrid with V. riviniana on Long Fell.|Eurasian Temperate element, with a continental distribution in W. Europe.
Viola tricolor|An annual or perennial herb, found on dunes and other sandy areas, on acidic grassland on heaths and hills, and in cultivated ground, gardens and waste places. 0-460 m (Clun Forest, Salop), and reportedly to 575 m in Scotland.|Native|V. tricolor was mapped as `all records` in the 1962 Atlas. The current map and local floras suggest that a widespread decline has occurred since then, particularly in S.E. England. Subsp. tricolor occurs throughout the range of the species; subsp. curtisii is mapped separately.|European Temperate element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Viscum album|A hemiparasite on a wide range of trees in orchards, hedgerows, parklands and gardens, but rarely in dense or primary woodlands. Its most frequent hosts are Malus spp., followed by Tilia x europaea, Crataegus spp. (its commonest native hosts), Populus spp., Acer spp., Salix spp. and Robinia pseudoacacia. Lowland.|Native|The native range of V. album is so obscured by introductions that all records are mapped as if they are native. A survey in 1969-72 produced many new records, suggesting that it had previously been under-recorded.

Vulpia bromoides|An annual of open grasslands, heaths, cliff-tops and sand dunes. It also grows in artificial habitats such as quarries, wall-tops, by railways and on waste ground in built-up areas. It was a frequent introduction from wool shoddy. V. bromoides favours well-drained soils, often growing abundantly on drought-prone S.-facing banks and slopes, but appears to be indifferent to soil pH. 0-490 m (Fanna Hill, Roxburghs.).|Native|There has been little change in the range of V. bromoides since the 1962 Atlas, though it now appears to be more frequent in many areas.|Submediterranean-Subatlantic element; widely naturalised outside its native range.
Vulpia ciliata|This annual occurs in disturbed sandy places. The native subsp. ambigua is found on tracks and paths through coastal dunes, and inland on sandy heaths, along roadsides and in patches of open grassland. The introduced subsp. ciliata is a rare casual from grain and wool shoddy. Lowland.|Native|V. ciliata was probably under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas. However, several new roadside populations of subsp. ambigua have been found since 1980, suggesting that it may be spreading in some areas (e.g. New Forest, S. Hants.). It was discovered in N. Wales in 1991.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element; subsp. ambigua is restricted to Britain, Belgium & N. France.
Vulpia fasciculata|An annual of sand dunes, particularly open, disturbed parts of fixed dunes, and sandy shingle, frequently associated with other winter-annuals. Lowland.|Native|This species appears to have increased since the 1962 Atlas, especially in East Anglia and N. Wales. It is not clear, however, whether it was missed by earlier recorders. Its abundance on some sites increased following reduction of rabbit populations due to myxomatosis in the mid-1950s.|Mediterranean-Atlantic element.     © C. Gibson
Vulpia myuros|An annual growing by railways, on walls and waysides, in pavement cracks and on waste ground in built-up areas. Occasionally found as a weed of cultivation and as an introduction from wool shoddy, grain and grass-seed mixtures. Lowland.|Archaeophyte|Even allowing for the possibility that this species was under-recorded in the past, it is clear that V. myuros has become increasingly frequent across much of its range since the 1962 Atlas. It is likely that the plant has colonised many areas via the rail network.|As an archaeophyte V. myuros has a Eurosiberian Southern-temperate distribution; it is widely naturalised outside this range.     © C. Gibson
Vulpia unilateralis|An annual of bare stony ground, dry banks and grassy tracks on chalk and limestone; also on railway ballast, walls and rubbish tips. Lowland.|Neophyte|V. unilateralis was first recorded in the British Isles in 1903. This inconspicuous species has been discovered in some new 10-km squares since the 1962 Atlas, though whether this means the species is increasing is uncertain. It has been much overlooked in the past, and is probably still under-recorded.|A Submediterranean-Subatlantic species; also recorded in C. Asia.
Wahlenbergia hederacea|A small, low-growing perennial herb found in damp, wet or boggy places on acidic soils, occurring on heaths, heathy pastures, moors, open woodland and Salix carr, and by streams and in flushes. In Ireland, it is most frequent beside streams and is absent from pastures. It prefers areas with moving, rather than standing, water. 0-485 m (Killakee, Co. Dublin).|Native|The decline in this species from the edges of its range was already apparent by the 1962 Atlas, and has continued since then. Reasons for losses include habitat destruction, improvement of pastures, increased grazing and peat extraction.|Oceanic Southern-temperate element.
Wolffia arrhiza|This tiny rootless plant floats on ponds and ditches as small, pure patches or scattered amongst other floating Lemnaceae. Reproduction is by vegetative budding; flowers have never been seen in our area. Lowland.|Native|W. arrhiza remains frequent in the Somerset Levels, but it has clearly declined since 1930 in the eastern part of its British range. It is now extinct in the London area.|Eurosiberian Southern-temperate element.
Woodsia alpina|W. alpina grows on the steep, free-drained, bare faces of calcareous rocks, including pumice tuffs, basalts, mica- and hornblende schists, slates and limestones. Sites are very free-draining, with little competition. From 525 m to 975 m on Ben Lawers (Mid Perth).|Native|First reported from Snowdonia in 1790, current populations of W. alpina are probably relics from more widespread populations in post-glacial times. It suffered a serious decline through collecting in the 19th century. New sites have been discovered since the 1962 Atlas, and current populations appear to be relatively stable.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Woodsia ilvensis|An evergreen fern, growing in cracks and fissures in cliffs and crags on rocks ranging from calcareous tuffs and hornblende schists to more acidic tuffs, grits and shales. Sites are very free-draining, with little competition. Reproduction is probably mostly vegetative. From 365 m to 760 m (Cumberland).|Native|Current populations of W. ilvensis are probably relics of a more widespread post-glacial distribution. It suffered serious declines due to collecting in the 19th century. Some older records (e.g. in Cumberland) may be erroneous. Re-introductions in Scotland and Teesdale are not mapped.|Circumpolar Boreo-arctic Montane element.
Zannichellia palustris|This submerged, perennial aquatic grows in a range of shallow-water habitats. The most characteristic include clear chalk streams, eutrophic lakes and ponds, and brackish lagoons, ponds and ditches. It is a frequent colonist of disused mineral workings. 0-380 m (Llynheilyn, Rads.).|Native|Z. palustris is much more frequent within its British and Irish range than was shown in the 1962 Atlas. This probably represents more effective recording, but there is evidence for the expansion of this species in S. Scotland, in response to eutrophication. Conversely, the current map shows a decline in England, presumably from drainage and ditch improvements.|Circumpolar Southern-temperate element.
Zea mays|A relic or escape from cultivation found on field edges, rubbish tips and waste ground, and also as a casual of bird-seed and kitchen waste in these habitats. The male and female flowers are borne on separate inflorescences; pollination is by wind and the seeds are not dispersed but are retained on the cob. Lowland.|Casual|Z. mays was being grown in Britain by 1562, but only extensively cultivated in S. Britain since the 1970s, mainly for livestock feed and, on a smaller scale, for human consumption. It was recorded from the wild by 1876, and is certainly increasing.|Not known in the wild, but long cultivated in the Americas and now grown in some temperate and most tropical and subtropical regions.     © C.

Zostera angustifolia|Z. angustifolia is a perennial which grows on sheltered tidal mudflats, in estuaries and in coastal lagoons, usually in shallower, more turbid water than Z. marina. It is usually found on mud or muddy sands, between the half-tide and low-tide marks. Lowland.|Native|Z. angustifolia was not recognised as a distinct species by British botanists until described as Z. hornemanniana by Tutin (1936). It was under-recorded in the 1962 Atlas, but its distribution is now better known.|Z. angustifolia is also recorded from Denmark and Sweden; it is difficult to distinguish from narrow-leaved variants of Z. marina and is not regarded as specifically distinct by Hartog (1970).
Zostera marina|Z. marina is a perennial which grows in the subtidal zone, on substrates of gravel, sand or sandy mud in areas which are protected from full exposure. It descends to depths of about 4 metres. Lowland.|Native|This species declined throughout its European range after a major outbreak of wasting disease in the 1930s. It has never fully recovered, and a further outbreak of disease was noted in the 1980s. However, there are obvious difficulties in recording this marine species and many old and recent records are based on stranded plants. The extent to which the map reflects the distribution of rooted plants is difficult to assess.|Circumpolar Wide-temperate element.     © C. Gibson
Zostera noltei|Although a coastal species, this perennial is found at higher levels of the shore than other Zostera species. It grows in sheltered estuaries and harbours, where it is found on mixed substrates of sand and mud. Plants are often concentrated in pools or runnels on the shore. Lowland.|Native|The distribution of Z. noltei appears to be stable, and it even persists in relatively polluted waters such as the Thames estuary. The reason for the decrease in Hampshire is unclear. It may have been present only as strand-line plants in other squares where it was last recorded before 1970.|Eurasian Southern-temperate element.     © C. Gibson
