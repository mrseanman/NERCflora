numeric fert5 ->
1 - Selfing
2 - Normally Selfing
3 - Mixed
4 - Normally cross
5 - Outcrossing

numeric fert3 ->
1 - Selfing
2 - Mixed
3 - Outcrossing

numeric rarity ->
1 - x "extinct"
2 - r "rare"
3 - o "only present in ire or chan. isl."
4 - s "scarce"
5 - n "present"

rarity is -according to plant atlas- just a binning of range size. That was
broadly correct but there were some examples conflicting that.

There is significant confidence in the coeff for range but not for rarity.
The +ve coeff for range is as expected from boxplots of range vs fert.
Numeric(rarity) is increasing with range, so the -ve coeff. for rarity is
unexpected and further decreses confidence in that part of the model.
The overall confidence in the 1st model is greater than in the 2nd. Thus the
linear model should not include numeric(rarity)

The residual plot in figure 01 is well behaved. The lines are due to the nature
of modelling a discrete dependent continuously. The lines slope downwards with
increasing range as the model fit is increasing (+ve coefficient) so the
residuals are decreasing. There is bunching at low range due to the increased
density of points at low range generally.

\/ These have passed an ANOVA \/
Outcrosisng increases with height.
Outcrossing decreses with salinity tolerance.

\/ These passed chi square test \/
Perennation is linked to fert mode

Annual      |0.18   0.32    0.11
Biennial    |0.00   0.06    0.05
Perrenial   |0.82   0.62    0.84
^^^  Fraction of column by row  ^^^

It seems a mixed plant is significantly less likely to be Perrenial and more
likely to be annual. It is hard for me to draw significance from this as the
trend does not follow linearly with outcrossing rate.

Vegetative cloning type is linked to fert mode
