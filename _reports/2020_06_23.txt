I have applied added traits that would qualify a species as being strictly outcrossing.
  These are:
    being dioecous
    being dichogamous
    being self self incompatible

  This increased the number of 'Obligatory outcrossing' species from 136 to 360.

There is no 'obligatory self' species. Only 'apomictic'
The only data in ecoFlora that I could find that would make a species obligatory
self was the column on 'Cleistogamy'.
  There were 62 species that were either  'pseudo-cleistogamous'    ,
                                          'entirely cleistogamous'  or
                                          'usually cleistogamous'


The total number of species that have no info on fertilization or cleistogamy and
cant be determined as obligatory cross by other means is 2175.

I filtered the poacae in the ecoFlora using theplantlist.org
of the 275 grass in the ecoFlora, 79 had info on Fertilization.
  of those 79 there were:
    22 normally cross
    13 normally self
    8 normally cross, viviparous
    7 obligatory cross
    ...


meaning of pseudo-cleistogamous?
apomictic?
