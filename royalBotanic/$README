the website was very broken. This is an attempt to fix the data.
The website timed out after 60s so i could only dload the data in parts.
Hence it is split in to 'parts' inside the parts folder.

These are then joined together. In all.ods

Some abstracts had "" in them which broke the csv.

I tried to fix this in libreoffice also

The complete, species ordered list is in data.csv
The delimiter is '|'
