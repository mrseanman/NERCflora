The lack of available markers has been particularly problematic in studies of within-species variation. Whilst microsatellites are now being developed in many algal species, there remains a need for universal markers that can be applied to a wide range of species.
The increasing availability of complete plastid genome sequences for several algae has allowed us to develop two sets of universal primers, similar to those available in higher plants, for the amplification of coding and non-coding regions of the plastid genome in red and green algae. These markers are expected to be useful in a broad range of algal population genetic and phylogenetic studies."

Discrimination of the two species is extremely difficult because of overlapping morphological characters. In this study a quick molecular method for species identification was developed based on the nuclear rDNA ITS2 sequence data of 54 E. intestinalis samples and 20 E. compressa samples from a wide geographical range. Oligonucleotide probes were designed for species-specific hybridization to dot-blots of the PCR-amplified ITS1, 5.8S gene and ITS2 fragment of both E. intestinalis and E. compressa . Specificity of the oligonucleotide probes was confirmed by tests with taxonomically diverse species that could morphologically be confused with E. intestinalis or E. compressa . This is the first use of species-specific probes for macroalgae. The restriction endonuclease Nru I digested specifically the amplified PCR product from E. compressa into two fragments detectable on agarose gels, but no suitable restriction sites were identifiable in the PCR product of E. intestinalis."

 populations of the dioecious charophyte Chara aspera Was Studied by
 means of cross-fertilization experiments and AFLP (Amplified Fragment
 Length Polymorphism). Three Swedish freshwater populations and three
 (German and Swedish) Baltic Sea populations of C. aspera were sampled.
 Cross-fertilization experiments were performed in a full combination
 setup of all populations and with two different salinities (0 and 10
 PSU). Both freshwater and brackish water females formed about 70% more
 gametangia at 0 than at 10 PSU. Male individuals collected from
 freshwater had higher fertility than brackish water males at both
 salinities. 57% of all gametangia of females from freshwater developed
 into oospores compared to only 8% of gametangia of brackish water
 females. 42% of all oospores were fertilized in crosses between
 habitats (freshwater-brackish water) compared to 36% in crosses within
 habitats, the difference was not significant.
 Oospore and bulbil germination was investigated using propagules from
 freshwater and brackish water populations and incubation salinities of
 0, 5, 10 and 20 PSU. None of the oospores collected from brackish water
 germinated. Germination of oospores and bulbils from freshwater was
 higher at 0 and 5 PSU than at higher salinities. Only around 40% of
 bulbils from brackish water germinated at 20 PSU compared to around 70%
 at the other three salinities. Germination of all bulbils was delayed
 at 20 PSU compared to other salinities.
 Genetic similarities (Jaccard indices of AFLP data) were higher within
 than between populations, but comparisons within habitat
 (freshwater-freshwater and brackish water-brackish water) were not
 different from comparisons between habitats.
 Our results did not identify any reproductive isolation between
 freshwater and brackish water populations, but indicate low gene flow
 between the two habitats. Oospore and bulbil germination success were
 highest at salinities corresponding to the conditions of their original
 habitat, suggesting genetic adaptation to their environmental
 conditions and indicating that propagules transported from freshwater
 to brackish water or vice versa will hardly develop into fertile
 plants. Additionally, brackish water plants perform poorer in all
 aspects of sexual reproduction than freshwater plants. Possibly,
 Successful dispersal of oospores is not subjected to high selective
 pressure within the Baltic Sea where new sites easily can be colonized
 by means of vegetative reproduction. We assume that these adaptations
 will favour speciation within C. aspera and support the idea of the
 geologically young Baltic Sea as a "cradle of plant evolution"."

We studied species that belong to sect. Grovesia (C. tenuispina, C. globularis, C. virgata, C. aspera and C. strigosa) and two species from the sect. Hartmania (C. intermedia and C. hispida).

UPGMA clustering and PCA analysis as well as morphological analysis revealed a clear separation of C. tenuispina and C. globularis, which formed separate clusters supported by high bootstrap values. Therefore, these species were distinguish as separate taxa, rather than varieties of C. globularis. Similarly, C. virgata also formed a separate cluster, thereby confirming that this taxon is a separate species, rather than a variety of C. globularis. The AFLP analysis did not show any differentiation between C. aspera and C. strigosa.

 populations have been described from several European locations.
 Sexually reproducing populations with female and male individuals are
 known only from the Neusiedler See located in Seewinkel National Park,
 Austria. Sexual and parthenogenetic populations probably coexist in
 this area, but no morphological attribute is known to differentiate
 between females of the two reproductive modes. To find markers
 associated with parthenogenesis, DNA samples from individuals of both
 reproductive modes were screened via amplified fragment length
 polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Although no unique monomorphic loci for
 the reproduction systems could be identified, neighbour-joining
 analysis separated the individuals into two groups representing the two
 reproductive modes. The rbcL gene sequence analysis also revealed two
 nucleotide differences among these groups. Sequence characterization of
 the flanking region of one microsatellite locus from C. canescens
 individuals identified one insertion/deletion (indel) between the
 reproductive modes. This indel was converted via polymerase chain
 reaction into a marker associated with sexual reproduction. Further
 analysis of the AFLP data showed a high level of polymorphism and
 genetic diversity between and within populations of the reproductive
 modes. A larger sample size is needed to confirm the gene pool cluster
 and the degree of genetic diversity between the reproductive modes
 finally, but the successful development of a promising marker system
 for the reproduction mode provides a tool for future research to
 characterise geographical parthenogenesis of C. canescens in detail."

Six primer pairs were selected for further investigations and tested with a total of 33 samples of C. hispida, C. intermedia and C tomentosa from several sampling sites.

For the first time, a polymerase chain reaction-based fingerprinting technique, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), was applied to detect genetic diversity in Chara. A total of 36 primer combinations were screened and the method was optimized for high sample throughput using three different fluorescence- label led primers simultaneously. Six primer pairs were selected for further investigations and tested with a total of 33 samples of C. hispida, C. intermedia and C tomentosa from several sampling sites. A total of 1265 different loci were detected. Ninety-nine percent of them showed polymorphisms. Although sample size was small, up to 91% intraspecific polymorphic loci were detected. The analysis included samples of C intermedia and C. hispida growing in the same habitat, as well as samples from other countries. Although genetic similarity between samples of C. intermedia and C hispida was high compared to C. tomentosa, clustering analysis revealed clear separation of samples according to morphological determination. Therefore, we disagree with R.D. Wood & K Imahori (1965. A revision of the Characeae, vol. 1. Monograph of the Characeae. J. Cramer, Weinheim) who classified C. intermedia as a variety of C. hispida. Because of its high sensitivity, AFLP is an ideal tool used for further investigating the biosystematics of the genus Chara."

To analyze the genetic diversity and taxonomic rank of several species from the genus Chara, the fingerprinting technique of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) was applied. We studied species that belong to sect. Grovesia (C. tenuispina, C. globularis, C. virgata, C. aspera and C. strigosa) and two species from the sect. Hartmania (C. intermedia and C. hispida). The individuals were collected in the field in north-eastern, central and eastern Poland. The species were identified based on morphological features and then analyzed using the AFLP fingerprinting method. UPGMA clustering and PCA analysis as well as morphological analysis revealed a clear separation of C. tenuispina and C. globularis, which formed separate clusters supported by high bootstrap values. Therefore, these species were distinguish as separate taxa, rather than varieties of C. globularis. Similarly, C. virgata also formed a separate cluster, thereby confirming that this taxon is a separate species, rather than a variety of C. globularis. The AFLP analysis did not show any differentiation between C. aspera and C. strigosa. The presented results do not fully support the taxonomic interpretation for the existence of several polymorphic species with numerous variations and forms, however, in some examples, the distinctive nature of the reproduction system may be used as a distinguishing feature of the taxa."

Brodie and J.M. Lewis","CRC Press","","Molecular systematic methods have been applied to all levels of problem in the diatoms. A possible sister group to the diatoms has been identified, the primary evolutionary radiation has been shown to be among centric diatom lineages, and the systematic positions of some problematic genera have been established. Certain structural characteristics previously used to diagnose higher taxa have been shown to exhibit homoplasy, and examination of selected complexes of diatoms has shown that cryptic and semicryptic species are probably widespread. Population genetics show that some species are panmictic over large geographical areas, while others are strongly differentiated at the population level, either geographically or temporally. Ongoing research addresses the major biogeographical question of whether diatom species are ubiquitous. On the negative side, most gene trees are disappointing because of the low statistical support for basal nodes in group-wide analyses; independent data sources (cytology, fossils) also mostly fail to discriminate between competing hypotheses of relationships. Constraints on progress include the relative poverty of culture collections and lack of multi-gene sequence data. The worst problem is the poor state of “diatomics” (holistic information about diatom species): for most diatoms, low-grade information about cell wall morphology is all that is available. Improved phylogenies are therefore often unedifying."

It colonizes rock substrata along the shoreline of lakes and rivers of watersheds that regularly experience water level fluctuations. The mycobiont produces perithecia with small, simple spores that are thought to be wind dispersed. The photobiont, Diplosphaera chodatii, occurs both free-living and lichenized but little is known about its distribution and dispersal. The goal of this study was to compare the population structure of the photobiont from lakes and rivers in central North America with those of Europe. Specimens were collected in Manitoba, Canada and Austria. Population structure of the algal symbiont was assessed using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and actin gene sequences. Results showed that genetic diversity and gene flow was high within local populations, but gene flow was low between continental populations. Low levels of gene flow between the most distant populations support the isolation-by-distance theory. The photobiont on both continents is also reported to be the photobiont for other lichen species contributing to photobiont availability for D. luridum."

In addition, to re-examine the taxonomic system of Nitella proposed by R.D. Wood, who treated oospore wall ornamentations as diagnostic at the infraspecific level, we carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses using the combined sequence data set for the gene encoding the beta subunit of ATP synthase (atpB) and the rbcL gene of these six species, as well as eleven species of Nitella studied previously. The combined sequence data resolved five robust clades within the subgenus Tieffallenia that were characterized by differences in oospore wall ornamentation. However, the species and sectional diagnoses of R.D. Wood, such as the form and cell number of dactyls in vegetative thalli, were variable within the clades. Therefore, R.D. Wood's taxonomic system appears unnatural, at least within the subgenus Tieffallenia."

We have utilized a combination of nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial genetic markers to study the biogeographic history of the red seaweed Palmaria palmata in the North Atlantic. Analysis of the nuclear rDNA operon (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2), the plastid 16Strn Itrn A-23S-5S,
rbcLrbc S and rpl 12-rps 31- rpl 9 regions and the mitochondrial cox 2–3 spacer has revealed the existence of a previously unidentified marine refugium in the English Channel, along with possible secondary refugia off the southwest coast of Ireland
and in northeast North America and/or Iceland. Coalescent and mismatch analyses date the expansion of European populations from approximately 128 000 BP and suggest a continued
period of exponential growth since then. Consequently, we postulate that the penultimate
(Saale) glacial maximum was the main event in shaping the biogeographic history of European
P. palmata

maximum (

represents a particular problem. We have employed a combination of plastid microsatellite
markers and DNA sequence data from three regions of the plastid genome to trace the invasive
history of the green alga Codium fragile ssp.tomentosoides. Extremely low levels of genetic
variation were detected, with only four haplotypes present in the species’ native range in
Japan and only two of these found in introduced populations. These invasive populations
displayed a high level of geographical structuring of haplotypes, with one haplotype localized
in the Mediterranean and the other found in Northwest Atlantic, northern European and
South Pacific populations. Consequently, we postulate that there have been at least two separate
introductions of C. fragile ssp. Tomentosoides from its native range in the North Pacific."

In this study we developed nine polymorphic microsatellite markers for the domoic acid–producing marine diatom Pseudonitzschia multiseries (Hasle) Hasle. We then used them in the genotyping of 25 physiologically diverse field isolates and six of their descendants: 22 field isolates originated from eastern Canadian waters, two from European waters, and one from Russian waters. The numbers of alleles per locus ranged from three to seven and the observed heterozygosities from 0.39 to 0.70. A substantial degree of genetic variation was observed within the field isolates, with 23 different genotypes detected. The Russian isolate was the most genetically distinct, although there was also evidence of genetic differentiation at a more local scale. Mating experiments demonstrated that alleles were inherited in a Mendelian manner. Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries primer pairs were tested on DNA from four congeners: P. calliantha Lundholm, Moestrup et Hasle; P. fraudulenta (P. T. Cleve) Hasle; P. pungens (Grunow ex P. T. Cleve) Hasle; and P. seriata (P. T. Cleve) H. Peragallo. Cross-reactivity was only observed in P. pungens. Our results are a first step in understanding the genetic variation present at the Pseudo-nitzschia ‘‘species’’ level and in determining the true biogeographic extent of Pseudo-nitzschia species."

Isolates were collected on 42 separate occasions from waters surrounding the German islands of Helgoland and Sylt over the course of three sampling periods: spring 2002, spring 2003, and autumn 2003. In total, 464 isolates were genotyped, of which 453 were different (i.e. clonal diversity was 98%). The numbers of alleles per locus ranged from 6 to 24 and the observed heterozygosities from 0.59 to 0.87 (mean Ho and He were 0.73); there were no significant departures from Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium at any of the six loci. Sexual reproduction therefore appears to be important in the production of genetic variation. Over the temporal and spatial scales sampled (18 months and 100 km), weak genetic differentiation was detected both within and between sampling periods (significant FST values ranged from 0.0018 to 0.0389), suggesting that the German North Sea supports a single largely unstructured population of P. pungens."

There is a need for a narrower species concept if contentious issues such as diatom biodiversities and biogeographies are to be resolved. We assessed the effectiveness of several genes (cox1, rbcL, 18S and ITS rDNA) to distinguish cryptic species within the model ‘morphospecies’, Sellaphora pupula agg. This is the first time that the suitability of cox1 as an identification tool for diatoms has been assessed. A range of cox1 primers was tested on Sellaphora and various outgroup taxa. Sequences were obtained for 34 isolates belonging to 22 Sellaphora taxa and three others (Pinnularia, Eunotia and  abularia). Intraspecific divergences ranged from 0 to 5 bp ( ¼ 0.8%) and interspecific levels were at least 18 bp ( ¼ c. 3%). Cox1 divergence was usually much greater than rbcL divergence and always much more variable than 18S rDNA. ITS rDNA sequences were more variable than cox1, but well-known problems concerning intragenomic variability caution against its use in identification. More information and less sequencing effort mean that cox1 can be a very useful aid in diatom identification. The usefulness of cox1 for determining phylogenetic relationships among Sellaphora species was also assessed and compared to rbcL. Tree topologies were very similar, although support values were generally lower for cox1. & 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
