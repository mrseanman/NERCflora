The study revealed that the rate of intragametophytic selfing in these homosporous pteridophytes is very low, i.e., on average 0.020 and 0.019, respectively, despite the potential hermaproditism and selling of the gametophytes. Most populations consisted of numerous genotypes, and the average heterozygosities of E. arvense and E. hyemale equalled 0.092 and 0.134, respectively. The commonly observed excess of the heterozygote genotypes indicates that there are interclonal differences in the frequency of vegetative reproduction. The level of genetic divergence among populations was considerable even within a limited geographic area. It is suggested that the life history of Equisetum, characterized by the inefficiency of spore germination and gametophyte reproduction in noncolonizing situations, limits the level of gene flow and leads to a great genetic divergence between populations."

"Equisetum arvense","Horsetail","DNA barcoding","","Worldwide","Saslis-Lagoudakis, C. Haris, Bruun-Lund, Sam, Iwanycki, Natalie E., Seberg, Ole, Petersen, Gitte, Jager, Anna K., Ronsted, Nina","2015","Identification of common horsetail (Equisetum arvense L.; Equisetaceae) using Thin Layer Chromatography versus DNA barcoding","Scientific Reports","5","Empirical paper","","","","The global herbal products market has grown in recent years, making regulation of these products paramount for public healthcare. For instance, the common horsetail (Equisetum arvense L.) is used in numerous herbal products, but it can be adulterated with closely related species, especially E. palustre L. that can produce toxic alkaloids. As morphology-based identification is often difficult or impossible, the identification of processed material can be aided by molecular techniques. In this study, we explore two molecular identification techniques as methods of testing the purity of these products: a Thin Layer Chromatography approach (TLC-test) included in the European Pharmacopoeia and a DNA barcoding approach, used in recent years to identify material in herbal products. We test the potential of these methods for distinguishing and identifying these species using material from herbarium collections and commercial herbal products. We find that both methods can discriminate between the two species and positively identify E. arvense. The TLC-test is more cost-and time-efficient, but DNA barcoding is more powerful in determining the identity of adulterant species. Our study shows that, although DNA barcoding presents certain advantages, other established laboratory methods can perform as well or even better in confirming species' identity in herbal products."

In France, it typically grows at high elevations but is very rare in lowlands. The genetic variation of these populations is described using isozyme electrophoresis and PCR- RFLP of chloroplast DNA. Sampled sites were chosen to represent central vs. marginal and/or endangered parts of the distribution area. Extensive clonal multiplication of plants together with the absence of local recruitment by sexual reproduction seem to be responsible for the low genetic diversity observed within populations. Since adaptive response to environmental changes ultimately relies on the presence of genetic variability, clonal populations of E. variegatum may be particularly vulnerable to disturbance. Moreover, in lowland populations, isolation gives no chance to recover new genotypes through migration events. The preservation of the two endangered populations is proposed by propagation by cuttings of all extant genetic individuals. In the case of a disappearance of one genotype in the field, a replacement will be possible. This plan may be sufficient to preserve E. variegatum in the French lowland for several years."
