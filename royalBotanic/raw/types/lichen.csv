Ramalina farinacea symbionts were characterized based on the two fungal nuclear loci (nrITS and rpb2) along with the primary and secondary structures of nrITS from each Trebouxia species in the Iberian Peninsula and Canary Islands. The results indicated a noticeable genetic differentiation between mycobionts from these two geographic areas and also suggested concerted changes in the three partners of a lichen symbiosis toward two clearly distinguishable holobiont lineages. Modeling of ITS2 RNA secondary structures suggested their temperature sensitivity in TR1 but not in TR9, which was consistent with the observed superior physiological performance of TR9 phycobionts under relatively high temperatures. Both TR1 and TR9 phycobionts have been also found in a variety of taxonomically distinct lichens with a preferably Mediterranean distribution, being TR1 much more widespread than TR9. Our observations support a model in which ecological diversification and speciation of lichen symbionts in different habitats could include a transient phase consisting of associations with more than one photobiont in individual thalli. Such diversification is likely to be promoted by different physiological backgrounds."
"Bactrospora dryina","Lichen","Gene flow","","European","Nadyeina, O, Zarabska-Bozejewicz, D, Wiedmer, A, Cornejo, C, Scheidegger, C","2017","Polymorphic fungus-specific microsatellite markers of Bactrospora dryina reveal multiple colonizations of trees","Lichenologist","49:561-577","Empirical paper","","","","Bactrospora dryina is an epiphytic lichen-forming fungus specifically related to old-growth floodplain forests, which have dramatically declined in Europe over the past centuries. In order to promote conservation management of such forest remnants, we aimed to study population genetics of this rare and threatened lichen. The newly developed 16 microsatellite markers are specific for the mycobiont of B. dryina and reliably amplify either single fruiting bodies or a sterile thallus. This allows the use of these markers for the identification of sterile crusts and for quantification of recent dispersal of the species into restored habitats. We tested the markers in 264 samples collected from 10 pedunculate oak trees growing in three localities in north-eastern Switzerland. All markers were polymorphic and showed two to five alleles per locus, and unbiased gene diversity varied from 0.06 to 0.71 over three populations. The relatively low number of alleles in B. dryina is possibly the consequence of colonization of secondary habitats created by forest management. Although oaks were largely covered with a single, continuous B. dryina colony, the microsatellite markers identified single or complex multi-genotype colonizations per tree. For future population genetic studies, we recommend collection of 5-15 specimens from one tree which would enable detection of 60-80% of the multilocus genotypes present. Hierarchical AMOVA revealed high variation (70%) on host trees, and a relatively high differentiation (12%) among the three locations in NE Switzerland indicated limited gene flow between those regions. Thus, the newly developed markers showed their applicability in population genetics at different spatial scales. They will play an important role in monitoring habitat restoration for the conservation of B. dryina and associated forests and riverscapes."

Carmel, Israel, designated by us 'Evolution Canyon'. The samples of wild barley were collected from six stations: three (upper, middle, lower) on the south-facing slope (SF-slope) and three (lower, middle, upper) on the north-facing slope (NF-slope). The samples of C. aurantia were collected from three stations: two (middle and upper) on the SF-slope and one (upper) on the NF-slope. Higher solar radiation on the SF- than on the NF-slope makes it warmer, drier, spatiotemporally more heterogeneous, and climatically more fluctuating and stressful. Consequently, it exhibits an open park forest representing an 'African' savanna landscape. Significant inter- and intraslope allozymic differentiation was found in both organisms with generally higher polymorphism, heterozygosity, allele and gene diversity on the more variable and stressful upper station of the SF-slope, as expected by the niche-width variation hypothesis, and the environmental theory of genetic diversity. Solar radiation, temperature and aridity stress caused interslope and intraslope differences on the SF-slope in genotypes and phenotypes of wild barley and the lichen at the 'Evolution Canyon' microsite, as was the case for beetles, diplopods and earthworms tested at the site. Diversifying natural (microclimatic) selection appears to be the major evolutionary driving force causing interslope and SF-intraslope adaptative genetic divergence. 'Evolution Canyon' proves an optimal model for unravelling evolution in action, across life and organizational levels."

An investigation of its population structure, based on nuclear ITS and IGS DNA sequences, shows that western North America has a higher number of haplotypes than the two other areas. Most of the haplotypes confined to this region are rare and occur outside the area that was affected by Pleistocene glaciations. Three haplotypes are common in all three areas. The high number of haplotypes in western North America might be due to a combination of events during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs, viz. increased lineage survival by repeated fragmentation of populations and reduced lineage extinction through rapid postglacial expansion and population growth."

Many species display large-scale infraspecific disjunctions, which have been explained alternately by range fragmentation in species of high age and widespread long-distance dispersal. Using the lichen Cavernularia hultenii, which is widely disjunct across North America and Europe, Pleistocene and Holocene population history was inferred. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and part of the the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA were sequenced in 300 individuals representing 62 populations across the range of the species. While four ancestral haplotypes are found in all areas, none of the observed tip haplotypes is present in more than one of the three part ranges. Although this is evidence for a past fragmentation event, nested clade analysis (NCA) remains equivocal in the choice between allopatric fragmentation and long-distance dispersal. Mismatch distributions indicate exponential population growth, probably during postglacial invasion of C. hultenii into formerly glaciated areas of western North America. The presence of one southern and at least one northern glacial refugium in South Central Alaska is inferred. Evidence for another refugium in the Queen Charlotte Islands or Alexander Archipelago is inconclusive because of sparse sampling. However, a range expansion was not confirmed unambiguously by NCA. The limited power of NCA to infer past range fragmentations and expansions is due apparently to the shallow haplotype network and widespread ancestral haplotypes. This can be explained by slow genetic drift causing incomplete removal of ancestral haplotypes from the postfragmentation and postexpansion areas."

Net photosynthesis and dark respiration (DR) at different temperatures (from 0 to 30 A degrees C) and photon flux densities (from 0 to 1,200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were studied for four populations of Cetraria aculeata. Samples were collected from maritime Antarctica, Svalbard, Germany and Spain, representing different climatic situations. Sequencing of the photobiont showed that the investigated samples fall in the polar and temperate clade described in Fernandez-Mendoza et al. (Mol Ecol 20:1208-1232, 2011). Lichens with photobionts from these clades differ in their temperature optimum for photosynthesis, maximal net photosynthesis, maximal DR and chlorophyll content. Maximal net photosynthesis was much lower in Antarctica and Svalbard than in Germany and Spain. The difference was smaller when rates were expressed by chlorophyll content. The same is true for the temperature optima of polar (11 A degrees C) and temperate (15 and 17 A degrees C) lichens. Our results indicate that lichen mycobionts may adapt or acclimate to local environmental conditions either by selecting algae from regional pools or by regulating algal cell numbers (chlorophyll content) within the thallus."

Shifting biomes due to climate change may lead to adjustments in species distributions and potential extinctions. Therefore, detailed monitoring is requisite to assess biologically meaningful shifts in community composition and species distributions. Some Arctic-alpine lichens have been shown to be particularly sensitive to climatic shifts associated with global change. However, accurate identification of lichenized fungal species remains challenging and may limit the effective use of lichens in climate change research. Given the inherent difficulties in accurate identification of lichenized fungi and the potential value of efficient identifications for bio-monitoring research, we investigated the utility of DNA barcode identification of the 13 brown Parmeliae (Ascomycota) species occurring in Greenland. For these species, we assessed monophyly and genetic distances using the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), the standard DNA barcode for fungi. We also compared intraspecific distance values to a proposed intra-interspecific threshold value for Parmeliaceae to identify nominal taxa potentially masking previously unrecognized diversity. Our results indicated that the 13 brown Parmeliae species occurring in Greenland can be successfully discriminated using the ITS region. All phenotypically circumscribed species were recovered as well-supported, monophyletic clades. Furthermore, our data supported a barcode gap among congeners for all brown Parmeliae species investigated here. However, high intraspecific genetic distances suggest the potential for previously unrecognized species-lineages in at least five species: Melanelia agnata, M. hepatizon, Montanelia disjuncta, M. panniformis, and M. tominii. Our research facilitates effective, long-term bio-monitoring of climate change in Greenland using lichens by providing accurate molecular identification of brown Parmeliae specimens."

Molecular methods are therefore increasingly used not only to elucidate phylogenetic relationships among taxa, but also to assign individuals to species. Most members of the genus Cladonia are conspicuous and frequently collected, but notoriously variable. At the same time the genus comprises species that have to be regularly monitored under EU legislation. A "DNA barcoding" approach could thus be very helpful to correctly identify taxa. The internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA repeat has been proposed as a universal barcoding marker for fungi. However, it has also been shown that data from this locus alone might be insufficient to reliably distinguish members of Cladonia. Taking the two similar species C. rangiferina and C. stygia as an example, we tested the suitability of ITS and five additional gene loci to distinguish species of Cladonia subgenus Cladina. Infraspecific variability was high in most of the investigated loci. Bayesian species delimitation using a multispecies coalescent approach based on multilocus DNA sequence data allowed us to separate the two species with high statistical support. The clustering of samples was also supported by phenotypic differences between the groups and a phylogenetic analysis. This allowed us to test the usefulness of single gene loci as barcoding markers on an objective basis. The only locus, for which minimum interspecific divergence exceeded maximum infraspecific variability in both species, was the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA repeat. Whether this locus should be suggested as an alternative or additional barcoding marker for the separation of Cladonia species needs to be tested with a broader taxonomic sample."

Population structure of the algal symbiont was assessed using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and actin gene sequences. Results showed that genetic diversity and gene flow was high within local populations, but gene flow was low between continental populations. Low levels of gene flow between the most distant populations support the isolation-by-distance theory.

We compared genetic variation and reproductive mode in two threatened Scandinavian lichens, Evernia divaricata and Usnea longissima, with more viable populations in North America to see (i) if these species also show genetical depletion in northern Europe and (ii) if the occurrence of sexual propagules (ascospores in apothecia) is more prevalent in genetically diverse populations. Genetic variation of the fungal component was assessed by sequencing two nuclear rDNA gene regions (ITS and IGS) in 1005 and 1477 thalli, collected from 92 and 160 localities of E. divaricata and U. longissima, respectively. Scandinavian populations of both species were almost devoid of genetic variation compared with much higher genetic diversity in North America. We found no support for the proposed relationship between genetic diversity and fertility. Fertile thalli were found in several genetically invariable populations. Fertility increased with population size and regional abundance in E. divaricata, but not in U. longissima. In Scandinavia, E. divaricata was more fertile than previously recorded, whereas all sampled populations of U. longissima were sterile and possibly clonal."

It was assumed that genetic variation within populations would be reflected in electrophoretic banding patterns of isozymes and, further, that participation of ascospores in initiating new thalli would contribute to populational variability. Comparisons of unrelated species indicated that the level of variability in an apotheciate lichen is not necessarily higher than that in a non-apotheciate species. However, in cases where comparisons were made between different stands of the same species or among related species within a limited geographic area, sexual forms usually appeared to be more polymorphic than those that were sterile. The degree to which variation in fertile stands exceeded that in stands of related sterile lichens may be attributable to meiotic reassortment in the course of ascosporogensis. However, much of the variability in both apotheciate and asexual lichens probably originates through some other mechanism."

An assessment of the genetic variability is necessary to formulate biologically sound conservation recommendations for this species. We investigated the genetic diversity of the fungal symbiont of L. pulmonaria using 143 specimens sampled from six populations (two small, one medium, three large) in the lowland, the Jura Mountains, the pre-Alps and the Alps of Switzerland. Among all nuclear and mitochondrial regions sequenced for this study, variability was found only in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS I), with three polymorphic sites, and in the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (nrLSU), with four polymorphic sites. The variable sites in the nrLSU are all located within a putative spliceosomal intron. We sequenced these two regions for 81 specimens and detected six genotypes. Two genotypes were common, two were found only in the more diverse populations and two were found only in one population each. There was no correlation between population size and genetic diversity. The highest genetic diversity was found in populations where the fungal symbiont is reproducing sexually Populations with low genetic diversity included only the two same common genotypes. Our study provides evidence suggesting that L. pulmonaria is self-incompatible and heterothallic. Based on our results we give populations with sexually reproducing individuals a higher rank in terms of conservation priority than strictly asexual populations. The remaining lowland populations are so small, that one single catastrophic event such as a windthrow might destroy the entire population. Hence we suggest augmenting such populations in size and genetic diversity using small thallus fragments or vegetative diaspores collected in other populations. As we did not detect any locally adapted genotypes, these transplants can be taken from any other genetically diverse population in Switzerland."

We analyzed 240 DNA extracts derived from snow samples by a L. pulmonaria-specific real-time PCR ( polymerase chain reaction) assay of the ITS ( internal transcribed spacer) region allowing for the discrimination among propagules originating from a single, isolated source tree or propagules originating from other locations. Samples that were detected as positives by real-time PCR were additionally genotyped for five L. pulmonaria microsatellite loci. Both molecular approaches demonstrated substantial dispersal from other than local sources. In a landscape approach, we additionally analyzed 240 snow samples with real-time PCR of ITS and detected propagules not only in forests where L. pulmonaria was present, but also in large unforested pasture areas and in forest patches where L. pulmonaria was not found. Monitoring of soredia of L. pulmonaria transplanted to maple bark after two vegetation periods showed high variance in growth among forest stands, but no significant differences among different transplantation treatments. Hence, it is probably not dispersal limitation that hinders colonization in the old-forest lichen L. pulmonaria, but ecological constraints at the stand level that can result in establishment limitation. Our study exemplifies that care has to be taken to adequately separate the effects of dispersal limitation from a limitation of establishment."

We collected 923 thalli from 41 sampling plots of 1 ha corresponding to the categories stand-replacing disturbance (burnt), intensive logging (logged) and uneven-aged forestry (uneven-aged), and analysed the thalli at six mycobiont-specific microsatellite loci. We found evidence for multiple independent immigrations into demes located in burnt and logged areas. Using spatial autocorrelation methods, the spatial scale of the genetic structure caused by the clonal and recombinant component of genetic variation was determined. Spatial autocorrelation of genotype diversity was strong at short distances up to 50 m in logged demes, up to 100 m in uneven-aged demes, with the strongest autocorrelation up to 150 m for burnt demes. The spatial autocorrelation was predominantly attributed to clonal dispersal of vegetative propagules. After accounting for the clonal component, we did not find significant spatial autocorrelation in gene diversity. This pattern may indicate low dispersal ranges of clonal propagules, but random dispersal of sexual ascospores. Genetic diversity was highest in logged demes, and lowest in burnt demes. Our results suggest that genetic diversity of epiphytic lichen demes may not necessarily be impacted by stand-level disturbances for extended time periods."

Owing to the spatio-temporal dynamics of host tree populations, substantial dispersal rates - corresponding to high levels of gene flow - are needed for populations to persist in a landscape. However, several epiphytic lichens have been suggested to be dispersal-limited, which leads to the expectation of low gene flow at the landscape scale. Here, we study landscape-level genetic structure and gene flow of a putatively dispersal-limited epiphytic lichen, Lobaria pulmonaria. The genetic structure of L. pulmonaria was quantified at three hierarchical levels, based on 923 thalli collected from 41 plots situated within a pasture-woodland landscape and genotyped at six fungal microsatellite loci. We found significant isolation by distance, and significant genetic differentiation both among sampling plots and among trees. Landscape configuration, i.e. the effect of a large open area separating two forested regions, did not leave a traceable pattern in genetic structure, as assessed with partial Mantel tests and analysis of molecular variance. Gene pools were spatially intermingled in the pasture-woodland landscape, as determined by Bayesian analysis of population structure. Evidence for local gene flow was found in a disturbed area that was mainly colonized from nearby sources. Our analyses indicated high rates of gene flow of L. pulmonaria among forest patches, which may reflect the historical connectedness of the landscape through gene movement. These results support the conclusion that dispersal in L. pulmonaria is rather effective, but not spatially unrestricted."

We tested the relative importance of forest patch quality, matrix surrounding fragments and connectivity on the genetic variation within populations and the differentiation among them. A total of 855 thalli were sampled in 44 plots (400 m(2)) of 31 suitable forest fragments (beeches and oaks), in the Sierra de Aylln in central Spain. Variables related to landscape attributes of the remnant forest patches such as size and connectivity and also the nature of the matrix or tree species had no significant effects on the genetic diversity of L. pulmonaria. Values of genetic diversity (Nei's) were only affected by habitat quality estimated as the age patches. Most of the variation (76%) in all populations was observed at the smallest sampled unit (plots). Using multiple regression analysis, we found that habitat quality is more important in explaining the genetic structure of the L. pulmonaria populations than spatial distance. The relatively high level of genetic diversity of the species in old forest patches regardless of patch size indicates that habitat quality in a highly structured forest stand determines the population size and distribution pattern of this species and its associated lichen community. Thus, conservation programmes of Mediterranean mountain forests have to prioritize area and habitat quality of old forest patches."

The allelic richness of genepool A was highest in the Alps, which is the evidence for a northern refuge of L. pulmonaria. Vicariant altitudinal distributions of the two genepools suggest intraspecific ecological differentiation."

Contrary to expectations, we found high genetic diversity in lichen and snow samples, and high effective sizes of the studied populations. Also, limited genetic differentiation between populations, high historical migration rates, and a high proportion of first generation immigrants were estimated, implying high connectivity across distances <30 km. Almost all genetic variation was attributed to variation within sites; spatial genetic structures within populations were absent or appeared on small scales (510 m). The high genetic diversity in the remaining old boreal rainforests shows that even relict forest patches might be suitable for conservation of genetic diversity."

Mating systems of fungal species can be self-incompatible, requiring the presence of isolates of different mating-type genes for sexual reproduction to occur, or self-compatible, requiring only one. Understanding the distribution of mating-type genes in populations can help to assess the potential of self-incompatible species to reproduce sexually. In the locally threatened epiphytic lichen-forming fungus Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm., low frequency of sexual reproduction is likely to limit the potential of populations to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Our study provides direct evidence of self-incompatibility (heterothallism) in L. pulmonaria. It can thus be hypothesized that sexual reproduction in small populations might be limited by an unbalanced distribution of mating-type genes. We therefore assessed neutral genetic diversity (using microsatellites) and mating-type ratio in 27 lichen populations (933 individuals). We found significant differences in the frequency of the two mating types in 13 populations, indicating a lower likelihood of sexual reproduction in these populations. This suggests that conservation translocation activities aiming at maximizing genetic heterogeneity in threatened and declining populations should take into account not only presence of fruiting bodies in transplanted individuals, but also the identity and balanced representation of mating-type genes."

We use hierarchical Bayesian parentage analysis, which integrates genetic and ecological information from multiannual colonization and dispersal source data collected in a large, oldgrowth forest landscape. The effective dispersal range of gametes is several hundred metres to kilometres from potential paternal individuals.

Our study reveals the dispersal distances of individual reproductive units; clonal propagules, gametes and ascospores, which is of great importance for a thorough understanding of the spatial dynamics of ascomycetes.

A total of 7 polymorphic markers were isolated and characterized. These microsatellites were tested in natural populations found in the Iberian Peninsula. The number of observed alleles ranged from 3 to 8, and the Nei's unbiased gene diversity from 0.26 to 0.59.

Theoretically either of these characteristics, a wide geographic range or generalized host ecology, could provide opportunities for genetic differentiation within this species. To determine how genetic variation is partitioned in M. corallinus, 12 fungal isolates were obtained from locations in North America and Europe; at two locations, in Washington County, Maine, and on the Isle of Mull in Scotland, fungi also were isolated from different lichen hosts. Vegetative mycelial compatibility tests were used to determine compatibility groupings from among the isolates; in addition, several PCR amplification products (RAPD, nuITS rDNA) were obtained for each isolate. A number of distinct compatibility groups were recognizable based on geography, not host ecology. In addition compatible isolates always were restricted to either North America or Europe. However RAPD markers indicated that compatible isolates are not always genetically identical. The presence of sequence heterozygosity at specific positions indicated that the isolates are heterokaryotic and a number of distinct haplotypes could be identified based on ITS variation at three separate locations. This type of genetic variation in these fungi suggests that sexual recombination is possible and that genetic differentiation has taken place recently as a result of geographic isolation, not host switching."

We successfully developed 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers and associated primer sets and assessed them with 30 individuals from two of the Canary Islands. The average number of alleles per locus was 8.8. Nei's unbiased gene diversity of these loci ranged from 0.53 to 0.91 in the tested populations. Amplification in two closely related species (P. tiliacea, P. cryptotiliacea) yielded only limited success. CONCLUSIONS: The new microsatellite markers will allow the study of genetic diversity and population structure in P. carporrhizans.

DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer, the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene, and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha were used as molecular markers. The haplotypes of the three markers and the molecular variance analyses of multilocus haplotypes showed the highest diversity in the Canary Islands, while restricted haplotypes occurred at high frequencies in Mediterranean coastal samples. The multilocus haplotypes formed three unevenly distributed clusters (clusters 1-3). In the Canary Islands all the haplotypes were present in a similar proportion, while the coastal Mediterranean sites had almost exclusively haplotypes of cluster 3; cluster 2 predominated in inland Mediterranean sites; and cluster 1 was more abundant in central and northern Europe (Eurosiberian area). The distribution of clusters is partially explained by climatic factors, and its interaction with local spatial structure, but much of the variation remains unexplained. The high frequency of individuals in the Canary Islands with haplotypes shared with other areas suggests that could be a refugium of genetic diversity, and the high frequency of individuals of the Mediterranean coastal sites with restricted haplotypes indicates that gene flow to contiguous areas may be restricted. This is significant for the selection of areas for conservation purposes, as those with most genetic variation may reflect historical factors and biological properties of the species."

The phylogeny of specimens from a broad geographic distribution was reconstructed from the internal transcribed spacer region. Pairwise genetic distances were calculated and compared to an intraspecific range defined for the parmelioid lichens to circumscribe species-level groups. Our results showed that P. reticulatum and P. pseudoreticulatum are polyphyletic, being comprised of at least seven well-supported lineages. In contrast, the genetic distance approach revealed ten cryptic lineages within the P. reticulatum - P. pseudoreticulatum complex. Neither morphology nor geography was conclusive in attempting to corroborate these genetic lineages. However F(ST) indices suggest significant genetic differentiation between these lineages. Our results suggest that the morphology-based circumscriptions underestimated species in Parmotrema and that, in some cases, genetic distances may be used as an additional tool to determine species boundaries in morphologically cryptic species complexes.

RAPD-PCR fingerprints of Graphis scripta, G. elegans and Phaeographis dendritica were successfully generated using this protocol and individual isolates could be identified on the basis of differences in banding patterns produced. DNA extracted from whole thalli of G. scripta was also subjected to RAPD-PCR but the fingerprints produced differed from those given by axenic cultures of the mycobiont.

The main aim of our study was to investigate the population genetics of a widespread and mainly clonally reproducing Usnea subfloridana at the landscape scale, focusing on the comparison of lichen populations within hemiboreal forest stands. Particular attention has been paid to the genetic differentiation of lichen populations in two geographically distinct regions in Estonia and the relationships between forest characteristics and measures of genetic diversity. We genotyped 578 Usnea thalli from eleven lichen populations using seven specific fungal microsatellite markers. Measures of genetic diversity (allelic richness, Shannon's information index, Nei's unbiased genetic diversity, clonal diversity, the number of multilocus genotypes, the number of private alleles, and the minimum number of colonization events) were calculated and compared between Usnea populations. Shared haplotypes, gene flow and AMOVA analyses suggest that unconstrained gene flow and exchange of multilocus genotypes exist between the two geographically remote regions in Estonia. Stand age, mean circumference of the host tree, size of forest site and tree species composition did not show any significant influence on allelic richness, Shannon's information index, Nei's unbiased genetic diversity, clonal diversity, the number of private alleles, and the minimum number of colonization events of U. subfloridana populations. Therefore it was concluded that other factors of habitat heterogeneity could probably have a more significant effect on population genetics of U. subfloridana populations. "

Three genotypes of B. frigida and two of X. elegans were detected in the Vestfold Hill collections. However, these differed by only one nucleotide position suggesting the presence of relatively little genetic variation, if the ITS region is indicative of the overall genome.

Both molecular techniques revealed significant variability. Phylogenetic analysis of RAPID profiles (226 markers) clustered isolates from particular locations together and Mantel's test showed a correlation between genetic divergence and extent of geographic separation. Phylogenies based on ITS sequence divergence were not well supported and did not correlate with the geographic origin of samples, suggesting a single locus approach to be less informative than RAPD data in a study of this nature. Physiological investigations also revealed significant variability between isolates with different geographic origins. Temperature had a significant effect on relative growth rate (RGR) such that X. elegans originating from sites with lower mean annual temperatures had significantly higher RGRs at all test temperatures between 2 degrees and 18 degreesC. Enhanced metabolic activity might be an adaptation for growth in colder climates.

Both markers revealed significant variation and a total of 10 IGS and 16 ITS haplotypes were found. There were no signs of significant positive spatial autocorrelation at any spatial size class down to 10% of transect length, nor did we find significant deviations from neutrality or signs of historical population expansion. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that most of the genetic variance observed was within populations, but when populations were grouped according to habitat, more than a quarter of the variance was explained among groups. Pairwise comparisons of populations (F-ST, exact tests of population differentiation) revealed significant differentiation between populations in different habitats (on bark or rock), but not between populations in the same habitat. Haplotype networks show that internal and presumably old haplotypes are shared between habitats, whereas terminal haplotypes tend to be unique to a habitat, mostly bark. We interpret the observed pattern to mean that there is no evidence of restricted gene flow between populations in the same habitat at the present spatial scale (interpopulation distances one or a few kilometres). On the other hand, differentiation between habitats is considerable, which we attribute to restricted gene flow between habitats (habitat isolation). Evidence suggests that the observed differentiation did not evolve locally. Estimates of divergence time between populations in the respective habitats indicate that an ancestral population started to diverge at least 34 000 years ago but probably much further back in time."
