M. Fleish. naturally exposed to different levels of atmospheric deposition of heavy metals. We also determined the heavy metal concentrations in samples of this moss to evaluate whether there was a relationship between atmospheric pollution and population genetic diversity. A low level of genetic diversity and a limited gene flow among populations were observed which is in accordance to the prevalence of asexual reproduction in this species. In addition, no significant correlation was found between metal content and gene diversity in P. purum, probably because of the common history of the sampled populations and/or to the lack of a drastic reduction of the size of the population; nonetheless, a clear genetic structure was evident in relation to the existing pollution gradient. Thus, based on the results of the principal coordinate analysis and Bayesian analysis of the genotypes, the mixed structure of the second most polluted population would suggest an ongoing differentiation of metal-tolerant genotypes in the most polluted sites of the sampling area."

Loeske in Maritime Antarctica and Southern-Patagonia","Frontiers In Ecology And Evolution","6","Empirical paper","","","","Bryophytes are a major component of vegetation in ice-free coastal regions of Antarctica. Sanionia uncinata (Hedw.) Loeske is distributed from northern and central Maritime Antarctica to Marguerite Bay in the southern part of this biome where it occurs sparsely. Production of sporophytes is rare for S. uncinata in Antarctica, thus a high level of genetic uniformity among populations is expected (Lewis Smith, 1984). Several ice advances and retreats events in last thousands of years in Patagonia and Antarctica could have driven different processes of speciation at fine scale or triggered genetic differentiation among populations, leading to unique genetic populations. A few studies have analyzed the genetic structure of mosses in Antarctica, but none in Maritime Antarctica or in the nearby zones such as southern Patagonia. Based on Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and grouping analysis, we determined levels of intra/and inter-population genetic diversity of S. uncinata in sites of this region. The results revealed that gene diversity within populations was low and that populations did not have significant genetic differentiation. Also, no correlation was found between genetic variability and geographic distance (R-2 = 0.031). However, we distinguished two groups of populations. One of them clustered populations with low values of genetic diversity. The other one was made out of populations showing much higher genetic diversity. Cluster 1 was the most geographically widely distributed covering populations from northern part of southern Patagonia to southern part of studied populations in Maritime Antarctica. Cluster 2 had the highest level of polymorphism, but spatially is very restricted to four populations in the Maritime Antarctica and southern Patagonia. We found substructures in some populations of the Maritime Antarctica such as in the Coppermine, Byers and Suffield populations. The underlying causes of this subdivision could be the asexual reproduction and significant abiotic factor affecting the presence of this moss species, but also the autoecious condition of this species. The importance of results is the concept of genetic connectivity among bioregions of South Patagonia and Antarctica suggesting additionally this interaction may have occurred repeatedly after the LGM, resulting in the vegetation that grows in Antarctica today."

Recent biochemical and molecular studies have suggested that many worldwide morphological species of bryophyte may represent genetically divergent and reproductively isolated cryptic species. We tested the cryptic species hypothesis in the thalloid liverwort Aneura pinguis complex. We applied analyses of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence variation and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods to discriminate between specimens of A. pinguis derived from various habitats in five distant geographical regions in Poland. Of the 19 specimens sequence characterized for the cpDNA tRNA(Leu) region, seven haplotypes were identified divided into three nonmonophyletic clusters. The application of developed PCR-RFLP markers confirmed the existence of three tRNA(Leu) types of A. pinguis (A-C) within the specimens derived from 21 populations. Sympatric populations of different tRNA(Leu) types were found in lowland and mountain regions. No clear correlation between stand type and the presence of two tRNA(Leu) types (A, B) was observed, as both were growing on soil, humus, and rocks. The tRNA(Leu) type C was found only on humus and its distribution was restricted to low-lying northern populations. The above results indicate that the A. pinguis complex is highly differentiated at the molecular level and may represent three cryptic species. (c) 2007 The Linnean Society of London."

This is the first study investigating SGS in a liverwort. Significant genetic differentiation was detected among colonies along and outside ant trails, and the SGS pattern varied depending on the spatial scale. At short distances, kinship coefficients were significantly positive up to about eight meters, after which they approached zero and turned negative, while at distances greater than 25 m the values were about zero. Thus, nearby individuals are more closely related than expected, at mid-distances less related, and at great distances genotypes show a random distribution. We suggest that the reproductive mode strongly affects SGS in B. attenuata. Asexual propagation by relatively large gemmae allows more effective establishment than sexual reproduction by small-sized spores, and causes an aggregation of similar genotypes, although the inbreeding effect cannot be ruled out. In environments with small-scale disturbances, e.g., ant trails, gemmae are favoured over spores at establishment. Also, the diaspore bank of the forest floor can be activated by disturbances, which may affect SGS. At mid-distances, the isolation by distance effect, presumably related to comparatively ineffective gemma dispersal, is visible, while at greater distances, the role of spores as effective means of dispersal is evident. The Sp statistic values, which quantify the strength of SGS, indicate that outsider colonies possess less SGS than do plant colonies along ant trails, which relates to the more frequent spore production of outsider colonies. Moreover, dispersal from fallen logs or stumps may be more effective than dispersal from ground-level colonies along ant trails. Apparently, ants do not have much role as dispersal vectors, nor do the physical structures of ant trails as dispersal corridors, although they provide open areas for colonization."

One hypothesis to explain this bias is that males produce sexual structures less often than females, but occur at similar frequencies, a hypothesis termed the "shy male hypothesis." Another nonexclusive possibility is that offspring sex ratios (as sporelings) are biased and populations retain this bias. To test these hypotheses, we examined sex ratios in expressing and nonexpressing shoots for the cosmopolitan moss Bryum argenteum collected in the field, and in shoots grown from spores in the lab. An examination of 154 collections of B. argenteum from native habitats and urban settings in the USA revealed that populations were significantly female-biased (>80% female). Male rarity was most pronounced in aridland regions of the Mojave Desert and California chaparral; males were significantly more common in altered urban habitats and in high elevation native habitats. When all shoots from clumps representing three mixed-sex, sporophytic populations were grown to sex expression, male nonexpressing shoots were not found to be significantly more abundant than expected based on the field expressing shoot sex ratio, lending little support to the "shy male hypothesis." Offspring sex ratios derived from sporelings were not significantly different from 1:1, thus not explaining the sharply female-biased population ratios observed in the field. We propose that factors between spore germination and adult maturation, including clonal dynamics, are causing the female-biased population and within-clump sex ratio imbalance of B. argenteum."

Bryophyte species show wider distributions than vascular plants and include examples of truly cosmopolitan ranges, which have been interpreted as a result of high dispersal capacities and ecological plasticity. In the current study, we documented patterns of genetic structure and diversity in the cosmopolitan moss Bryum argenteum along an elevational gradient to determine if genetic diversity and structure is homogenized by intense migrations in the lack of ecological differentiation. Methods: 60 specimens were collected in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain) between 100 and 2870 m and sequenced for ITS and rps4. Comparative analyses, genetic diversity estimators, and Mantel's tests were employed to determine the relationship between genetic variation, elevation, and geographic distance and to look for signs of demographic shifts. Key results: Genetic diversity peaked above 1900 m and no signs of demographic shifts were detected at any elevation. There was a strong phylogenetic component in elevational variation. Genetic variation was signifi cantly correlated with elevation, but not with geographic distance. Conclusions: The results point to the long-term persistence of Bryum argenteum in a range that was glaciated during the Late Pleistocene. Evidence for an environmentally driven pattern of genetic differentiation suggests adaptive divergence. This supports the Baas Becking tenet and indicates that ecological specialization might play a key role in explaining patterns of genetic structure in cosmopolitan mosses."

A survey of herbarium specimens found that similar intermediates are widespread in continental Europe and also occur in Asia, Alaska and Greenland. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from three loci imply that B. neodamense and intermediate plants are nested within the rather variable B. pseudotriquetrum. It is therefore concluded that, despite its striking morphological characters, B. neodamense is an inconstant phenotype of B. pseudotriquetrum, which occurs very locally in highly calcareous habitats that are subject to periodic inundation."

In bryophytes, sex ratios are often female biased, and little information is available about how and when bias forms. METHODS: To test whether population sex-ratio variation can emerge during the gametophytic phase and is not purely a product of spore sex ratios, we created artificial populations of the moss Ceratodon purpureus, with male- and female-biased sex ratios, and placed half under a stress treatment. We hypothesized that male-majority populations would become female-biased and that stress would increase this transition. After 18 mo, when sporophytes were initially forming, we used sex-specific molecular markers to determine population sex ratios. KEY RESULTS: Female-majority populations did not differ significantly from their original bias, whereas male-majority populations became significantly more female biased. The plants had only just produced their first spores, so these sex-ratio changes occurred during the gametophytic generation, as a result of sex-specific growth or survival. Sporophytes occurred only in populations with female-biased final sex ratios, which suggests that females in male-majority populations may have invested energy in ramets rather than in sporophyte production. The stress treatment was mild and had no effect on sex ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that female bias can be generated during the gametophytic generation, before plants reach sexual maturity. These results, combined with those of previous work, suggest that both the gametophytic and the sporophytic stages drive population sex ratios in C. purpureus, thus indicating that multiple mechanisms operate to create biased population sex ratios."

One locus of C. stygium shows fixed heterozygosity, suggesting an allopolyploid origin with these two haploids as progenitors. Two other loci, which are heterozygous in >90% of all plants screened, also support this view. It is also possible, however, that C. stygium is an autopolyploid, most likely of C. arcticum, in which meiosis has become regularized. Despite strong morphological differences between them, we detected only one fixed allelic difference between C. arcticum and C. latifolium. For C. subrotundum, another bisexual polyploid with n = 14, the evidence for allopolyploidy is very strong, with seven fixed heterozygous loci out of 17 scored. One of the lineages involved is similar to that of C. arcticum and C. latifolium, but the other is highly divergent from any known extant species of Cinclidium. It is quite possible, however, that additional, highly divergent species exist or, at least, once existed, as our screening of populations from Alaska turned up a new, highly genetically distinct species that experts have previously mistakenly referred to C. latifolium."

In the present study, four regions of chloroplast DNA (rbcL-a, rps4, trnH-psbA, trnL intron) were used to investigate the applicability of DNA barcoding to four moss genera of Grimmiaceae (Racomitrium, Coscinodon, Grimmia, Schist idiom) in China. The species resolution of the four loci examined was 65% (trnH-psbA), 59% (rps4), 53% (rbcL-a) and 29% (trnL intron). However, rps4 (59%) provided a higher value of monophyletic species with bootstrap support >50% than trnH-psbA (47%), rbcL-a (35%), and trial, intron (18%). No multi-locus combinations could significantly increase the species resolution but they increased the percentages of monophyletic species with bootstrap support >50% compared to the best single locus. Species of the genus Racomitrium could be resolved completely by rps4 and mostly (>80%) by rbcL-a or trnH-psbA. The species of Coscinodon (i.e., C. cribrosus) showed distinct plastid region sequences in rbcL-a, rps4, trnH-psbA, and toil., intron. Inter-specific sequence sharing or high intra-specific variability led to large amounts of barcoding failure in Grimmia, and Schistidium. Furthermore, using a combination of morphological characteristics and DNA barcoding for identification, a moss species, Racomitrium elongation, was recorded for the first time in China. The results suggest that trnH-psbA is potentially the best barcode in mosses and rps4 a good supplementary locus for future use, as standard plant barcodes (rbcL + matK) do not perform well in this taxonomic group."

All Svalbard collections could be readily assigned to five species, D. acutifolium, D. elongatum, D. laevidens, D. majus, and D. spadiceum, respectively. It is concluded that DNA barcoding improves species identification of Arctic Dicranum plants, but that a combination of several markers is necessary in order to obtain reliable identification results, with the single loci ITS1, trnL-F and rps4-trnT being the most promising regions."

The species was once thought to be a British endemic, being known from two former copper/tin mine sites in Cornwall, until the discovery of a population in 2006 at Allihies Mountain Mine, Co. Cork, Ireland, a former copper mine. In light of this discovery, two theories of possible introduction from Britain to Ireland were put forward: (1) an introduction from the 1800s and (2) a more recent introduction (2000s). Only male plants of the species are known, and reproduction and dispersal are therefore solely through asexual propagules and fragmentation. In order to address the conservation questions of the origin of the Irish population and to determine whether diversity exists within this rare species, genetic fingerprinting (amplified fragment length polymorphism) was carried out on the three known global populations. Percent polymorphism was found to be 7.29% and Nei's total gene diversity (H-T) was 0.0356. AMOVA revealed that, of the small amount of variation found, the majority was among the three populations (98%). The presence of five private alleles in the Allihies population suggests a longer period of isolation than would fit either theory of introduction. Cluster analyses reveal that the Allihies population is more genetically distinct than the two British populations are to each other, thus heightening the conservation priority for this population."

Mean genetic diversities per population were 0.138, 0.247 and 0.271, respectively, and total diversities equalled 0.223, 0.385 and 0.421, respectively. Relative differentiation levels (FST values of 0.173, 0.280 and 0.142, respectively) were significant but showed that there is a moderate amount of gene flow taking place within the lake system connected with narrow streams. Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis provided some indication that the direction of water flow influences population genetic structuring in the studied aquatic mosses. We propose that dispersal leading to gene flow in C.megalophyllum, F.antipyretica and F.hypnoides takes place both along water via connecting streams and by animal vectors, such as waterfowl. Nevertheless, the slight genetic structuring pattern along the direction of water flow suggests that dispersal of shoots or their fragments along water is a means of dispersal in these mosses. The absence of sexual reproduction and spores may have caused the observed spatial genetic structure within populations, including aggregations of similar genotypes (clones or closely related genotypes) at short distances in populations otherwise showing an isolation by distance effect. Regardless of the results pointing to the dominance of vegetative propagation, it is impossible to completely rule out the potential role of rare long-distance spore dispersal from areas where the species are fertile."

Here, we studied the genetic diversity in F. hygrometrica along an abiotic gradient in the Mediterranean high mountain of Sierra Nevada (Spain) using a genome scan method. Eighty-four samples from 17 locations from 24 to 2700 m were fingerprinted based on their amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) banding pattern. Using PCA and Bayesian inference we found that the genetic diversity was structured in three or four clusters, respectively. Using a genome scan method we identified 13 outlier loci, which showed a signature of positive selection. Partial Mantel tests were performed between the Euclidean distance matrices of geographic and climatic variables, versus the pair-wise genetic distance of the AFLP dataset and AFLP-positive outliers dataset. AFLP-positive outlier data were significantly correlated with the gradient of the climatic variables, suggesting adaptive variation among populations of F. hygrometrica along the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We highlight the additional analyses necessary to identify the nature of these loci, and their biological role in the adaptation process."

In the present study, four regions of chloroplast DNA (rbcL-a, rps4, trnH-psbA, trnL intron) were used to investigate the applicability of DNA barcoding to four moss genera of Grimmiaceae (Racomitrium, Coscinodon, Grimmia, Schist idiom) in China. The species resolution of the four loci examined was 65% (trnH-psbA), 59% (rps4), 53% (rbcL-a) and 29% (trnL intron). However, rps4 (59%) provided a higher value of monophyletic species with bootstrap support >50% than trnH-psbA (47%), rbcL-a (35%), and trial, intron (18%). No multi-locus combinations could significantly increase the species resolution but they increased the percentages of monophyletic species with bootstrap support >50% compared to the best single locus. Species of the genus Racomitrium could be resolved completely by rps4 and mostly (>80%) by rbcL-a or trnH-psbA. The species of Coscinodon (i.e., C. cribrosus) showed distinct plastid region sequences in rbcL-a, rps4, trnH-psbA, and toil., intron. Inter-specific sequence sharing or high intra-specific variability led to large amounts of barcoding failure in Grimmia, and Schistidium. Furthermore, using a combination of morphological characteristics and DNA barcoding for identification, a moss species, Racomitrium elongation, was recorded for the first time in China. The results suggest that trnH-psbA is potentially the best barcode in mosses and rps4 a good supplementary locus for future use, as standard plant barcodes (rbcL + matK) do not perform well in this taxonomic group."

H. Rob. on the Baltic island of Oland, with the aim of understanding the relationships between sexual reproduction, habitat age, genetic variation and factors related to growth conditions. The overall proportion of fertile female shoots (with perichaetia) was 35%. Fertility status at the level of individual shoots was positively associated with shoot length and density, while within deme fertility was positively associated with bush cover. There was no association between female fertility and habitat age, genetic diversity (HS) or allelic richness. Out of 1344 investigated shoots, only two were normal-sized fertile males. Dwarf males were also extremely rare, and found almost exclusively on shoots with sporophytes. Few sporophytes were observed (in the two demes with highest fertility and bush cover). No relationship between genetic variation and the frequency of sporophytes and males was found. The lack of a relationship between sexual reproduction and genetic variation suggests that sexual reproduction may not occur in the same grassland fragments as the recruitment of new clones (from spores or vegetative fragments). The majority of the dry, open grassland habitats, where H. lutescens is typically found in the study area, appear to be suboptimal for both dwarf males and fertilization. Sexual reproduction is more likely to occur in shaded (although grazed) grassland patches, where moisture levels are likely to be higher and the moss colonies are generally more vigorous."

Mean within-deme gene diversity (H-S = 0.152) was moderate compared with other bryophyte studies, and the between-deme proportion of the total diversity (G(ST) = 0.100, Jost's D = 0.011) was low but significantly different from zero. Clonal mixing, measured as the proportion of two adjacent shoots having different haplotypes, was relatively high (mean 0.32 over all demes). HS was higher in old grassland fragments, but negatively related to vascular plant species richness. Allelic richness (A) was positively associated with the area of old (>= 280 years) grassland in the surroundings: although demes in old grasslands are genetically more variable than those in younger grasslands, proximity to large areas of old grassland may promote genetic variability even in younger grassland demes. The importance of management continuity for species diversity has been stressed in many earlier grassland studies. Here, we conclude that grassland fragments with a long history of grazing continuity are also positively associated with variability at within-species level, as exemplified by the bryophyte H. lutescens."

The recombinants, always found in areas of overlap between the putative parent haplotypes, show that establishment from spores is at least sometimes effective. Northern and central European populations possess only the two commonest and widespread haplotypes, while southern populations show much greater diversity and unique haplotypes. Two particularly distinct haplotype groups occur, respectively, in the eastern Mediterranean and in Iberia-North Africa. These results, similar to those obtained in previous studies on a range of organisms, suggest glacial survival in, and recolonization from, the Mediterranean peninsulas. In the present case, the Balkan and Italian peninsulas are the most likely source of extant northern populations. The pattern shown by H. sericeum differs, however, from that exhibited by other organisms studied in showing high levels of unique haplotypic diversity in the British Isles and adjacent mainland, providing evidence that it survived in periglacial refugia in these areas. Nesting of H. lutescens sequences within those of H. sericeum indicates that it has been derived from within the latter. Molecular clock estimates of the timing of major divergences within the network are consistent with the Pleistocene glacial record."

Genetic variation and structure were analysed in seven urban, extraurban and remote populations of Leptodon smithii, an epiphytic moss of Quercus ilex, a phanerogamic species of Mediterranean climax vegetation. A total of 210 individual shoots were DNA extracted and amplified with internal simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers, and 54 haplotypes were identified. An uneven distribution of haplotype number and frequencies was observed among sites, with a higher number of haplotypes and more homogeneous haplotype frequencies in the extraurban/remote populations. Molecular diversity indices were overall higher in the extraurban sites than in the urban ones. Multilocus linkage disequilibrium values were in line with the occurrence of sexual/asexual reproduction in the seven populations. The isolation-by-distance model was not supported by Mantel test among sites; however, within-population fixation index (F-ST) highlighted a clear relation between genetic and physic distances among trees, suggesting a limited dispersal range for L. smithii's spores. The genetic structure was mainly affected by population size, wood structure and extent, and genetic drift consequent to habitat fragmentation and human-induced disturbance."

A core set of microsatellite markers was identified for use in population genetic studies of this species, and employed to ascertain its mating patterns. An initial collection of 88 sporophytes gathered from widely separated locations in a meadow in central Ohio, U.S.A. was screened for genetic uniformity based on trnL-F DNA sequences, and found to display considerable heterogeneity. Fifty-three members of the largest clearly defined clade were selected for genotyping at 6 variable microsatellite loci having expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.11 to 0.70. Fifty-two individuals (98.2%) were homozygous at all 6 loci, strongly indicative of self-fertilization. Only one individual (1.8%) appeared to be an outcrossed sporophyte, being heterozygous at 4 loci. Twenty-three samples that constituted a second well-marked clade displayed complex microsatellite genotypes strongly suggestive of a polyploid cytotype that, although not readily amenable to further analysis, is also not inconsistent with the predominantly selfing mating pattern exhibited by the 53 others. Male and female branches within gametophyte stems were observed to develop simultaneously or nearly so, and in 4 dense moss clusters within which samples of 8 gametophytes were genotyped, all 8 were found to be identical within each cluster. These results indicate that the overall mating pattern is predominantly selfing, and suggest that the species reproduces principally in what is, in effect, a clonal fashion, via the union of genetically identical gametes. This may be occurring both within and between gametophytes."

Sampled populations, located in southern Finland, were classified as natural or disturbed. All species possessed a fair amount of genetic variation both within populations (mean diversities per population of 0: 411 +/- 0: 118, 0: 403 +/- 0: 111, and 0: 307 +/- 0: 077, respectively) and across populations (0.599, 0.618, and 0.400, respectively). On average, natural and disturbed populations possessed similar levels of genetic diversity. Differentiation levels (F-ST values of 0.356, 0.298, and 0.302, respectively) were significant but showed that there is some gene flow taking place. The Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis provided additional information on the population genetic structures. Although R. squarrosus was the species with the lowest level of genetic variation, its populations inhabiting urban, disturbed habitats tended to contain highly differentiated genotypes of different origins, which suggests that human-mediated dispersal is important in urban habitats. In addition, detailed analyses of the spatial genetic structure of R. squarrosus showed that at short distances (1 to <30 m) individuals are more closely related than expected, while at greater distances (30 to 500 m) kinship decreases with increasing distance. Thus, the rarity of sexual reproduction was visible in the spatial genetic structure within R. squarrosus populations, as aggregations of similar genotypes were found at short distances in populations otherwise showing isolation-by-distance effect."

The diploid Plagiochila britannica has alternatively been considered an autopolyploid derivative of Plagiochila porelloides or an allopolyploid of Plagiochila asplenioides and P. porelloides; however, experimental evidence is still lacking. Here we present phylogenetic analyses of the P. asplenioides-P. britannica-P. porelloides complex based on a sampling of 37 accessions and plastid DNA rps4 and rbcL and nuclear ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences. Plastid DNA sequences of four accessions of P. britannica cluster with P. asplenioides, whereas nrITS sequences of P. britannica cluster with P. porelloides.

Contrary to earlier belief, P. britannica is not closely related to Plagiochila arctica. European and North American accessions of P. porelloides form sister lineages. A putative accession of P. asplenioides from Canada forms a separate lineage and may represent another taxon."

Sampled populations, located in southern Finland, were classified as natural or disturbed. All species possessed a fair amount of genetic variation both within populations (mean diversities per population of 0: 411 +/- 0: 118, 0: 403 +/- 0: 111, and 0: 307 +/- 0: 077, respectively) and across populations (0.599, 0.618, and 0.400, respectively). On average, natural and disturbed populations possessed similar levels of genetic diversity. Differentiation levels (F-ST values of 0.356, 0.298, and 0.302, respectively) were significant but showed that there is some gene flow taking place. The Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis provided additional information on the population genetic structures. Although R. squarrosus was the species with the lowest level of genetic variation, its populations inhabiting urban, disturbed habitats tended to contain highly differentiated genotypes of different origins, which suggests that human-mediated dispersal is important in urban habitats. In addition, detailed analyses of the spatial genetic structure of R. squarrosus showed that at short distances (1 to <30 m) individuals are more closely related than expected, while at greater distances (30 to 500 m) kinship decreases with increasing distance. Thus, the rarity of sexual reproduction was visible in the spatial genetic structure within R. squarrosus populations, as aggregations of similar genotypes were found at short distances in populations otherwise showing isolation-by-distance effect."

Because many species and populations of dioecious bryophytes do not express their sex, it remains mostly unresolved whether expressing individuals reflect the ratios of genetically male and female plants. The present study assesses the population sex ratio of the wetland moss Pseudocalliergon trifarium in central and northern Europe. For the first time in a bryophyte, we estimate the sex ratio in a population by assessing directly both expressing and non-expressing plants. Expressed gender ratio was assessed from herbarium specimens. Single shoots from non-expressing specimens were sexed using a recently developed molecular sex marker. On the basis of the female and male frequencies in these two data sets and the overall proportion of expressing specimens, we estimate the European population sex ratio to be 1.93 : 1 (female/male). Expressed, non-expressed, and population sex ratios are not significantly different from each other, suggesting that gender differences in rates of sex expression cannot account for the female bias. Earlier studies of P. trifarium failed to reveal gender-specific growth rates or pre-zygotic reproductive costs. Gender differences at the spore to protonemal stage, in mortality, or niche preferences could potentially explain the uneven sex ratio."

Here we test morphological species circumscriptions in a species complex of the moss genus Racomitrium, the R. canescens complex, based on variable DNA sequence markers from the plastid (rps4-trnT-trnL region) and nuclear (nrITS) genomes. The extensive morphological variability within the complex has led to different opinions about the number of species and intraspecific taxa to be distinguished. Molecular phylogenetic reconstructions allowed to clearly distinguish all eight currently recognised species of the complex plus a ninth species that was inferred to belong to the complex in earlier molecular analyses. The taxonomic significance of intraspecific sequence variation is discussed. The present molecular data do not support the division of the R. canescens complex into two groups of species (subsections or sections). Most morphological characters, albeit being in part difficult to apply, are reliable for species identification in the R. canescens complex. However, misidentification of collections that were morphologically intermediate between species questioned the suitability of leaf shape as diagnostic character. Four partitions of the molecular markers (rps4-trnT, trnT-trnL, ITS1, ITS2) that could potentially be used for molecular species identification (DNA barcoding) performed almost equally well concerning amplification and sequencing success. Of these, ITS1 provided the highest species discrimination capacity and should be considered as a DNA barcoding marker for mosses, especially in complexes of closely related species. Molecular species identification should be complemented by redefining morphological characters, to develop a set of easy-to-use molecular and non-molecular identification tools for improving biodiversity assessments and ecological research including mosses."

The species resolution of the four loci examined was 65% (trnH-psbA), 59% (rps4), 53% (rbcL-a) and 29% (trnL intron). However, rps4 (59%) provided a higher value of monophyletic species with bootstrap support >50% than trnH-psbA (47%), rbcL-a (35%), and trial, intron (18%). No multi-locus combinations could significantly increase the species resolution but they increased the percentages of monophyletic species with bootstrap support >50% compared to the best single locus. Species of the genus Racomitrium could be resolved completely by rps4 and mostly (>80%) by rbcL-a or trnH-psbA. The species of Coscinodon (i.e., C. cribrosus) showed distinct plastid region sequences in rbcL-a, rps4, trnH-psbA, and toil., intron. Inter-specific sequence sharing or high intra-specific variability led to large amounts of barcoding failure in Grimmia, and Schistidium. Furthermore, using a combination of morphological characteristics and DNA barcoding for identification, a moss species, Racomitrium elongation, was recorded for the first time in China. The results suggest that trnH-psbA is potentially the best barcode in mosses and rps4 a good supplementary locus for future use, as standard plant barcodes (rbcL + matK) do not perform well in this taxonomic group."

This paper investigates the phylogeography of the leafy liverwort Radula lindenbergiana to determine: (1) whether or not morphologically cryptic diversification has occurred in Macaronesia, and (2) the relationships between Macaronesian and continental populations. Location Macaronesia, Europe, Africa. Methods Eighty-four samples were collected across the species' distribution range and sequenced at four chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci (atpB-rbcL, trnG, trnL and rps4). Phylogenetic reconstructions and Bayesian ancestral area reconstructions were used in combination with population genetics statistics (H, N(ST), F(ST)) to describe the pattern of present genetic diversity in R. lindenbergiana and infer its biogeographic history. Results Patterns of genetic diversity in R. lindenbergiana exhibit a striking westwards gradient, wherein haplotype (0.90) and nucleotide (0.0038 +/- 0.0019) diversity peak in Macaronesia, with a substantial endemic component. We found 20.9% of the genetic variance between biogeographic regions, and most pairwise F(ST) comparisons between regions are significantly different from zero. The global N(ST) (0.78) is significantly higher than the global F(ST) (0.20), providing evidence for the presence of phylogeographic signal in the data. Ancestral area reconstructions suggest that the haplotypes currently found in western Europe share a Macaronesian common ancestor. Main conclusions The haplotype diversification exhibited by R. lindenbergiana in Macaronesia is comparable to that reported for many angiosperm groups at the species level. The apparent lack of radiation among Macaronesian bryophytes may thus reflect the reduced morphology of bryophytes in comparison with angiosperms. The high diversity found among Macaronesian haplotypes, especially in Madeira and the Canary Islands, and the significant N(ST)/F(ST) ratio between Macaronesia and all the other biogeographic regions (an indication that mutation rate exceeds dispersal rates) suggest that Macaronesian archipelagos could have served as a refugium during the Quaternary glaciations. Many haplotypes currently found in Europe share a Macaronesian common ancestor, and this further suggests that Macaronesia might have played a key role in the back-colonization of the continent."

Seventy-three Alps specimens were sampled from W Switzerland to W Austria, and were divided into four regional populations along a West-South-West (WSW) to East-North-East (ENE) gradient. These populations were compared with similar ones previously studied in other parts of Europe. The ENE-most Alps population, located ENE of the Adige break zone, deviates genetically from the other three. The two WSW-most populations of the Alps appear to be relatively isolated from most of the European populations outside the Alps, whereas the two ENE ones are similar to populations of northern Scandinavia. Populations in between the Alps and the Scandinavian mountain range deviate from those to the north and south, possibly due to low effective population sizes, earlier bottleneck events, or colonization from different source populations. Haplotype diversity and number of private haplotypes are marginally higher in the Alps than in Scandinavia. It is suggested that European Rhytidium originated from late glacial maximum refugia in (1) E-NE Europe, (2) in between the Late Glacial Maximum ice shields of Scandinavia and the Alps, and (3) S, SW, and W of the Swiss Alps.

The focus is Europe (124 samples), and especially Scandinavia (79), but most regions of the species' distribution area except northern Eurasia were sampled. Haplotype variation appears greater in Scandinavia than in Central Europe, with five of the European haplotype groups found only in Scandinavia compared with one unique to Central Europe. The Central European haplotype group probably survived the glaciations in one or several of the well-known refugia of the northern Mediterranean, but this seems unlikely for the Scandinavian haplotypes. The latter could have survived in northern refugia or immigrated from the east or north-east. On a global scale, several haplotype groups have restricted distributions, which could be due to sparse sampling in some regions, or the evolution or extinction of haplotypes. Some haplotypes were perfectly bipolar, whereas the species as a whole is imperfectly bipolar.

We investigated morphological and genetic variability within a highly polymorphic and taxonomically controversial species complex of the genus Sphagnum in order to reveal the ultimate causes of discordance between morphology and molecular evolution. Specifically, we aimed at addressing the following questions: (1) Are the three closely related European taxa (S. angustifolium, S. fallax, S. flexuosum) of the S. recurvum group morphologically and genetically distinct entities? (2) Are morphological and genetic groups concordant? (3) Is there any sign of hybridization among taxa that might complicate their morphological delimitation? We show that European specimens of the S. recurvum group form three distinct gene pools based on 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Individuals defined as morphotype "fallax" appear to be genetically clearly distinct from both morphotype "angustifolium" and "flexuosum". However, for the latter two morphotypes, traditionally used morphological and genetic markers provide partly incongruent taxonomic delimitations. We show that in about 13% of the accessions 12 traditionally used morphological characters cannot fully distinguish the genetic groups revealed. Our genetic analysis also reveals that only a low proportion of the specimens (3%) is admixed suggesting that hybridization is unlikely to explain the taxonomical controversies observed. Therefore, we hypothesize that taxonomic controversies are likely due to the extreme phenotypic plasticity of morphological characters rather than to porous species boundaries."

Theory predicts that dispersal by fat-tailed kernels reshuffles genetic material, and thus, preserves genetic diversity during colonization. Moreover, if efficient long-distance dispersal is coupled with random colonization, an inverse isolation effect is predicted to develop in which increasing genetic diversity per colonizer is expected with increasing distance from a genetically variable source. By contrast, increasing isolation leads to decreasing genetic diversity when dispersal is via thin-tailed kernels. Here, we use a well-established model group for dispersal biology (peat mosses: genus Sphagnum) with a fat-tailed dispersal kernel, and the natural laboratory of the Stockholm archipelago to study the validity of the inverse isolation hypothesis in spore-dispersed plants in island colonization. Population genetic structure of three species (Sphagnum fallax, Sphagnum fimbriatum and Sphagnum palustre) with contrasting life histories and ploidy levels were investigated on a set of islands using microsatellites. Our data show (phi(st)', amova, IBD) that dispersal of the two most abundant species can be well approximated by a random colonization model. We find that genetic diversity per colonizer on islands increases with distance from the mainland for S.fallax and S.fimbriatum. By contrast, S.palustre deviates from this pattern, owing to its restricted distribution in the region, affecting its source pool strength. Therefore, the inverse isolation effect appears to hold in natural populations of peat mosses and, likely, in other organisms with small diaspores."

 local adaptation by continuously redistributing genetic variability. In
 this study, we tested for adaptation at the molecular level by

 tests and comparison of population differentiation based on the GapC

The moss genus Sphagnum (peat mosses) provides a good example in which morphological and genetic characters often contradict each other. We investigated morphological and genetic variability within a highly polymorphic and taxonomically controversial species complex of the genus Sphagnum in order to reveal the ultimate causes of discordance between morphology and molecular evolution. Specifically, we aimed at addressing the following questions: (1) Are the three closely related European taxa (S. angustifolium, S. fallax, S. flexuosum) of the S. recurvum group morphologically and genetically distinct entities? (2) Are morphological and genetic groups concordant? (3) Is there any sign of hybridization among taxa that might complicate their morphological delimitation? We show that European specimens of the S. recurvum group form three distinct gene pools based on 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Individuals defined as morphotype "fallax" appear to be genetically clearly distinct from both morphotype "angustifolium" and "flexuosum". However, for the latter two morphotypes, traditionally used morphological and genetic markers provide partly incongruent taxonomic delimitations. We show that in about 13% of the accessions 12 traditionally used morphological characters cannot fully distinguish the genetic groups revealed. Our genetic analysis also reveals that only a low proportion of the specimens (3%) is admixed suggesting that hybridization is unlikely to explain the taxonomical controversies observed. Therefore, we hypothesize that taxonomic controversies are likely due to the extreme phenotypic plasticity of morphological characters rather than to porous species boundaries."

The existence of hybrids was initially hypothesized based on incidence of conspicuously large sporophytes in S. girgensohnii in the presence of male S. russowii. Measurements of nuclear DNA content, morphology and isozymes provide the first evidence of spontaneous hybridization across ploidal levels in bryophytes. Viable spores from the hybrid capsules yielded triploid protonemata and juvenile gametophores in culture. Isozyme profiles of the triploid gametophores displayed unbalanced heterozygous patterns containing two alleles. As S. russowii is an allodiploid species with S. girgensohnii and S. rubellum as progenitors, isozyme banding patterns of the triploids are interpreted as consisting of a single allele copy from the S. rubellum genome in S. russowii, and two copies of another allele at the same locus inherited from S. girgensohnii. The triploid sporophytes can be considered as F-2 hybrids formed by introgression. The allotriploid gametophores are formed through diplospory or syndiploidy in the hybrid capsules. Comparison of hybrid sporophyte morphology to S. girgensohnii and S. russowii confirmed that hybrid capsules are larger and with an abnormally swollen sporophyte foot. The spore sizes of the hybrid capsules were significantly larger than spores from normal, intraspecific S. girgensohnii capsules. The percentage of germinated spores was <5% in cultures from hybrid sporophytes, which is much lower than in intraspecific sporophytes. The new knowledge opens the way for re-evaluation of polyploid evolution in bryophytes with emphasis on gametic non-reduction, introgression and two-step models of polyploid formation."

It is considered taxonomically heterogeneous, and two subspecies have been described. Isozyme analyses were carried out on populations of S. majus from Central Norway and from eastern coast of North America in order to assess the origin, taxonomy and population structure of this species. High levels of fixed heterozygosity in the populations demonstrate that S. majus is a genetic allopolyploid. At all 'loci' screened, extant populations of S. cuspidatum shared enzyme bands with S. majus. The other most likely progenitor based on morphology, S, annulatum, was fixed for enzyme bands not found in S. majus. The progenitor genotype of S. annulatum? may have been missed because of inadequate sampling or extinction. Alternatively, another extinct or undetected taxon may constitute the second progenitor. The observed patterns of genetic variation and linkage disequilibria were uncorrelated with the previously proposed subspecific classification of S. majus. Lack of genetic divergence between continents suggests that the origins of S. majus in Europe and North America were not independent. Low mutation rates and large effective population sizes may be important causing populations to diverge slowly, and may explain the observed patterns without hypothesising frequent long-distance dispersal."

One-hundred-thirty-eight shoots from four populations were analyzed by 35 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) loci. Molecular diversity indices highlight a general low level of variation, which is higher in centre-northern populations than in the southernmost one. AMOVA indicates that most variation is partitioned among populations, supporting a low level of gene flow and a severe isolation among them (F-ST = 0.7071-0.9198; Nm = 0.106). Mantel test gave a significant correlation (0.8634, P = 0.0083) between genetic and geographical distances. A strong association among loci suggests that recombination due to sexual reproduction contributes poorly to genetic variation observed, supported by the lack of sporophytes in the study areas. Both experimental results and theoretical predictions suggest a concrete risk of local extinction for the studied populations, further increased by fragile habitats hosting the species in Italy. The southernmost population is the most threatened, due to combined effects of lower genetic variation and geographic isolation."

The genetic diversity of the Hawaiian population is comparable to that of larger population systems. Several lines of evidence, including a lack of sporophytes and an apparently restricted natural distribution, suggest that sexual reproduction is absent in the Hawaiian plants. In addition, all samples of Hawaiian S. palustre share a genetic trait rare in other populations. Time to most recent ancestor (TMRCA) analysis indicates that the Hawaiian population was probably founded 4951 kyr ago. It appears that all Hawaiian plants of S.palustre descend from a single founder via vegetative propagation. The long-term viability of this clonal population coupled with the development of significant genetic diversity suggests that vegetative propagation in a moss does not necessarily preclude evolutionary success in the long term."

In this way, a pattern resembling introgression is created within a single generation. Some individuals possessed nuclear genomes typical for S. capillifolium in combination with the chloroplast haplotype of S. quinquefarium, possibly indicating backcrossing.

Although, most Northern Hemisphere peatmoss species have wide circumboreal/nemoral ranges, little is known about the magnitude and effects of long-distance dispersal and barriers in shaping the genetic structure of such species. We investigate whether high dispersal capacity has caused genetic homogeneity across broad areas of the Northern Hemisphere, or whether barriers act to shape genetic structure across different species with similar distributional ranges. Location Northern Hemisphere. Methods We studied genetic variation and structure in six Sphagnum species using 19 microsatellite loci. Results Four out of six species were genetically structured in similar ways; with mainly one Beringian and one Atlantic group. Overall, both the North American and Eurasian continents seemed to act as a barrier to gene flow in several species. However, the most abrupt breakpoint between genetic groups was found in south-east Alaska. Main conclusions We found evidence for extensive gene flow between regions across the Northern Hemisphere among peatmosses, with oceans seemingly acting as weaker barriers to gene flow than landmasses. Plants from the amphi-Atlantic and amphi-Beringian regions of several species were genetically differentiated. Similar genetic structuring across several species, indicate that spore-producing species do not disperse freely across their entire distributional range, but are likely limited by wind directions, landmass barriers and/or habitat availability."

Principal coordinates analysis of 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed a significant gradient coinciding with water pH, but independent of geography; even samples from the same fens were clearly separated along this gradient. However, most of the genetic variations remained unexplained, possibly because of the introgression from phylogenetically allied species. This explanation is supported by the small heterogeneous cluster of samples that appeared when populations morphologically transitional to S.subnites, S.rubellum, or S.russowii were included into the analysis. Alternatively, this unexplained variation might be attributed to a legacy of glacial refugia with recently dissolved ecological and biogeographic consequences. Isolation by distance appeared at the smallest scale only (up to 43km). Negative spatial correlations occurred more frequently, mainly at long distances (up to 950km), implying a genetic similarity among samples which are very distant geographically. Our results confirm the high dispersal ability of peatmosses, but simultaneously suggested that their ability to cope with a high pH/calcium level is at least partially determined genetically, perhaps via specific physiological mechanisms or a hummock-forming ability."

They are generally intolerant of calcium and magnesium bicarbonate, but some species are adapted to mineral-rich fens. A previous study found a coincidence between genetic variation and the ability to tolerate high pH/calcium levels in Sphagnum warnstorfii. Here we compare its microsatellite variation with that of two rarer calcium-tolerant species (Sphagnum subnitens, S. contortum), using a novel data set from Eurasia. Because physiological experiments indicate that S. warnstorfii can tolerate high magnesium levels, we included also samples from dolomite and serpentinite. Genetic diversity of S. warnstorfii was higher than that of other species. The Bayesian analysis in program Structure resulted in two population groups of S. warnstorfii. One group coincided with dolomite (Italy, Austria, Estonia) and moderately magnesium-rich (but calcium-poor) rocks (serpentinite, metadolerite, cordierite-bearing migmatite on the Bohemian Massif), while the second one coincided with magnesium-poor bedrock across Eurasia. The principal coordinate analysis revealed a cline between populations from magnesium-rich and magnesium-poor bedrocks, with populations from dolomite and serpentinite forming one extreme. Populations from magnesium-poor bedrock located far from any dolomite or serpentinite formed the opposite extreme of the cline. We demonstrate for the first time that magnesium toxicity may drive bryophyte microevolution, as has repeatedly been shown for vascular plants, including ferns."

T. tomentella is a habitat-limited, unisexual hepatic, which occupies spring and mesic habitats in woodland. The relatively small populations are increasingly fragmented with a high risk for extinction for extrinsic reasons. The presence of relatively high levels of genetic diversity regardless of population size highlights the role of even small remnant populations as important sources of genetic diversity in T tomentella. The long-term accumulation of genotypes and somatic mutations may explain the observed levels of diversity. Gene flow among populations seems to be infrequent indicating dispersal limitation also on the relatively small spatial scale. Colonization within populations is not affected by isolation by distance suggesting the occurrence of random short-range dispersal of detached vegetative fragments. The population structure study confirmed the low mortality rates of shoots indicating a long life span of the clones in favourable conditions. Efficient ramet production by branching is likely to operate against interspecific competition. To conclude, T tomentella appears to persist well in undisturbed habitats due to clonal regeneration, although restricted dispersal capacity is likely to prevent successful (re-)colonization in the potential habitat patches of recovering forest landscapes. The implications of the results for conservation are introduced. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
