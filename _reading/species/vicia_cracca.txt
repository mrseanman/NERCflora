#Isozyme variation and phylogenetic relationships in Vicia subgenus Cracca (Fabaceae)
#Jaaska, V
#2005
--------------------------------
Background and Aims The phylogenetic relationships among 27 vetch species belonging to the subgenus Cracca of the genus Vicia were studied in comparison with three species of Lathyrus section Lathyrus on the basis of isozyme variation. Methods Isozymes encoded by 15 putative loci of ten enzymes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isozyme variation was analysed by using parsimony and neighbour-joining methods. Key Results The analyses revealed 63 parsimony-informative and 36 species-specific orthozymes. Of the latter, 23 are monomophic and are suitable for identification of V. benghalensis, V. palaestina, V. dumetorum, V. pisiformis, V. sylvatica, V. onobrychioides, V. cappadocica, V. cretica, V. articulata, V. tetrasperma, V. ervilia, V. hirsuta and V. loiseleurii. Polymorphism with heterozygous and homozygous isozyme genotypes was found for V. cracca, V. tenuifolia, V. ochroleuca, V. villosa, V. sylvatica, V. cassubica, V. sparsiflora, V. megalotropis, V. altissima, V. onobrychioides, V. cassia, V. cretica and L. heterophyllus, reflecting outcrossing in these species. By contrast, V. benghalensis, V. palaestina, V. disperma, V. dumetorum, V. pisiformis, V. orobus, V. pauciflora, V. tetrasperma and V. loiseleurii had only homozygous isozyme genotypes at polymorphic loci. Isozyme-based phylogenetic trees are presented. Conclusions Sections Cracca, Ervum, Pedunculatae and Lenticula of traditional taxonomy are monophyletic groups, whereas sections Oroboideae (= Vicilla) and Panduratae appear polyphyletic and section Cassubicae is split into two species-couples linked at a low level of support. Treatment of ervoid species in a separate subgenus Ervum is not supported because of its polyphyly.

#Systematics and biogeography of Lathyrus (Leguminosae) based on internal transcribed spacer and cpDNA sequnce data

--------------------------------
Lathyrus (Leguminosae; Papilionoideae) is the largest genus in tribe Fabeae and exhibits an intriguing extratropical distribution. We studied the systematics and biogeography of Lathyrus using sequence data, from accessions representing 53 species, for the internal transcribed spacer plus 5.8S-coding region of nuclear ribosomal DNA as well as the trnL-F and trnS-G regions of chloroplast DNA. Our results generally supported recent morphology-based classifications, resolving clades corresponding to sections Lathyrus and Lathyrostylis, but question the monophyly of the large, widespread section Orobus sensu Asmussen and Liston. Sections Orobus, Aphaca, and Pratensis form a predominantly northern Eurasian-New World clade. Within this clade, the North American and eastern Eurasian species, including both Holarctic species (L. palustris and L. japonicus), form a transberingian clade of relatively recent origin and diversification. The South American Notolathyrus group is distant from this transberingian lineage and should be reinstated as a distinct section within the northern Eurasian-New World clade. The Notolathyrus lineage reached the New World most probably through long-distance dispersal from Eurasia. The remaining sections in the genus are centered on the Mediterranean region.
