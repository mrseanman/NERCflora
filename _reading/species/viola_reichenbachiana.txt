--------------------------------
Hybridization between plant species occurs frequently but hybrids axe often restricted to ecotones or disturbed habitats. In this study we show that introgressive hybrids between the tetraploid Viola riviniana and the diploid V. reichenbachiana invaded pine forests of the Dubener Heide (central Germany), an area affected by calcareous pollutants. The spread of these violet: populations was correlated with, the impact of pollution on habitat conditions. We compared morphology, cytology and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) bands among six Viola populations from the Dubener Heide and three populations of each pure species. RAPD analysis using 12 primers revealed 141 scorable bands. We considered bands as species specific if they occurred in at least 75% of the plants in one pure violet species but in none of the other. Seven bands were specific to V. riviniana and 11 bands were specific to V. reichenbachiana. Two plants of a V. reichenbachiana population were identified as hybrids. Of the Viola populations from the Dubener Heide, one was diploid and could be classified as V reichenbachiana by morphology and RAPD markers. However, the majority of the Dubener Heide populations were tetraploid, and of a more variable morphology than V. riviniana and V. reichenbachiana, showing different combinations of intermediate characters, characters of the pure species and extreme characters. Despite their overall genetic similarity to V; riviniana, these plants could be identified as introgressive hybrids between V. riviniana and V reichenbachiana by species- specific RAPD bands. Therefore, we propose that recurrent hybridization and backcrossing resulted in novel genotypes adapted to the changed environment of polluted pine forests.

#No evidence of contemporary interploidy gene flow between the closely related European woodland violets Viola reichenbachiana and V.riviniana (sect. Viola, Violaceae)

Viola reichenbachiana (2n=4x=20) and V.riviniana (2n=8x=40) are closely related species widely distributed in Europe, often sharing the same habitat throughout their overlapping ranges. It has been suggested in numerous studies that their high intraspecific morphological variability and plasticity might have been further increased by interspecific hybridisation in contact zones, given the sympatry of the species and the incomplete sterility of their hybrid. The aims of this study were to: (i) confirm that V.reichenbachiana and V.riviniana have one 4x genome in common, and (ii) determine the impact of hybridisation and introgression on genetic variation of these two species in selected European populations. For our study, we used 31 Viola populations from four European countries, which were analysed using AFLP and sequencing of a variable plastid intergenic spacer, trnH-psbA. Our analysis revealed that V.reichenbachiana exhibited larger haplotype diversity, having three species-specific haplotypes versus one in V.riviniana. The relationships among haplotypes suggest transfer of common haplotypes into V.riviniana from both V.reichenbachiana and hypothetically the other, now extinct, parental species. AFLP analysis showed low overall genetic diversity of both species, with V.riviniana showing higher among-population diversity. None of the morphologically designated hybrid populations had additive AFLP polymorphisms that would have indicated recent hybridisation. Also, kinship coefficients between both species did not indicate gene flow. V.riviniana showed significant population subdivision and significant isolation by distance, in contrast to V.reichenbachiana. The results indicate lack of gene flow between species, high influence of selfing on genetic variability, as well as probably only localised introgression toward V.riviniana.

Morphological characters, AFLP markers and flow cytometry were used to investigate the morphological and genetic variability and differentiation of Viola reichenbachiana and V. riviniana in non-metallicolous (NM) and metallicolous (M) populations. The aims were to clarify the taxonomic status of plants occurring in ore-bearing areas, to determine any relationship in V. reichenbachiana and V. riviniana from sites not polluted with heavy metals, and to examine the genetic variability and differentiation of M and NM populations of both species. Multivariate analyses based on morphological characters showed significant differences between V. reichenbachiana and V. riviniana from non-polluted sites, high levels of intra-and inter-population variability, and the occurrence of inter-specific hybrids. Plants from M populations showed hybrid characters but also fell within the range of V. riviniana or V. reichenbachiana. There were no significant differences in relative genome size between plants from polluted areas and V. riviniana from NM populations. Bayesian analysis of population genetic structure based on AFLP markers distinguished two main groups: V. reichenbachiana and V. riviniana together with the M populations. That analysis also revealed the occurrence of populations of inter-specific hybrids from non-polluted areas. Further Bayesian analysis of V. riviniana including NM and M populations separated all the studied M populations from NM populations. We conclude that plants forming the M populations are well adapted to a metal-polluted environment, and could be considered as stabilised introgressive forms resulting from unidirectional (asymmetric) introgression toward V. riviniana.
