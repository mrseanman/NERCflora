#Clonal diversity and allozyme variation in populations of the arctic sedge Carex bigelowii (Cyperaceae).
#Jonsson, BO, Jonsdottir, IS, Cronberg, N
#1996
--------------------------------
1 A study of allozyme variation in vegetatively propagating populations of the rhizomatous sedge Carex bigelowii, revealed high levels of clonal diversity (genet diversity) within populations. The structure of allelic variation within the populations suggests that sexual reproduction has played a significant role in these C. bigelowii populations, despite present lack of seedling recruitment. The study was carried out in moss-heath communities on Icelandic lava-fields. Two adjacent populations were studied at one site, while a third population was studied at a second site, 35 km away from the first two populations. 2 The number of genets detected in each population, among 85-88 analysed ramets, ranged from 41 to 55 (minimum estimate). Samples were taken every 4m along transects in the populations. Ramets with the same allozyme genotype were often spatially aggregated. No seedlings have been observed in the populations during five years of demographic studies. 3 All the populations studied showed a diploid expression of allozymes and high levels of allelic variation, with on average 49% polymorphic loci (P), 1.77 alleles per locus (A) and an allelic diversity (H-S) of 0.167, Similar levels of within- population variability are found in many wind-pollinated and outcrossing plant species. 4 The difference between observed and expected heterozygosity was small in all populations, suggesting high levels of outbreeding. 5 Comparisons with other Carer taxa show that the levels of and structuring of allozyme diversity in C. bigelowii is similar to that in other outbreeding species (usually rhizomatous), and much higher than in inbreeding species (which are usually caespitose). 6 Only 5% of the total allelic diversity was explained by differences between the two study sites (G(ST) = 0.055), suggesting extensive recent or historic gene-flow.

#Ecological genetic variation in seed banks .3. Phenotypic and genetic differences between young and old seed populations of Carex bigelowii.
#Vavrek, MC, Mccgraw, JB, Bennington, CC
#1991
--------------------------------
(1) Three approaches were used to determine if phenotypic and genetic variation existed among seed subpopulations of different ages within an Arctic seed bank:  (i) morphology and growth rate of seedlings were compared under a common environment; (ii) morphology, growth rates and ecological response to temperature-controlled environments and density were compared using vegetative offspring (ramets); (iii) relative competitive responses of ramets were compared under multiple environments. (2) Phenotypic differences in leaf length and number of leaves were demonstrated among the subpopulations.  Seedlings of the young subpopulation initially had longer leaves, but this difference was lost within 4 weeks indicating that the difference was probably of maternal or historical origin.  The young subpopulation consistently maintained a greater number of leaves across environments and through time, however.  These differences indicate that genetic change occurred in the population under natural conditions within c. 200 years. (3) Consistent differences in response to environment and density were also found.  The old subpopulation did not show as great a response to increasing temperature as the young subpopulation.  Also, biomass of the old subpopulation was unaffected by an increase in density, whereas the young subpopulation showed less growth at increased density.  The origin of these differences are probably due to evolutionary change within the extant, seed-producing population rather than genetic change occurring within the seed bank.  Differential response to density was not reflected in a difference in relative competitive ability.

#Genetic variation and clonal diversity in four clonal sedges (Carex) along the Arctic coast of Eurasia.
#Stenstrom, A, Jonsson, BO, Jonsdottir, IS, Fagerstrom, T, Augner, M
#2001
--------------------------------
We studied the structure of genetic variation (at both ramet- and genet-level) and clonal diversity within and among populations in the four closely related arctic clonal sedges Carex bigelowii, C. ensifolia, C. lugens and C. starts by use of allozyme markers. Compared to other sedges and arctic plants, the studied taxa all had high levels of genetic variation, both within populations and taxa. These taxa contained most of the total gene diversity (H-T) within populations and a small part of the diversity among populations (G(ST) ranged 0.05-0.43). Carex bigelowii had genetic variation (H-S = 0.173, mean for populations) at a comparable level to other outbreeding arctic plants and to other widespread, rhizomatous and mainly outbreeding Carex species. In contrast, C. ensifolia (H-S = 0.335), C. lugens (H-S = 0.339) and C. stans (H-S = 0.294) had within-population variations that were higher than in most other studied Carex species and for arctic plants in general. Genetic variation was not related to any tested environmental variable, but it was lower in areas deglaciated only 10 000 years BP compared to areas deglaciated 60 000 years BP or not glaciated at all during the Weichselian. All the populations were multiclonal, except for two populations of C. starts that were monoclonal. In contrast to genetic variation, clonal diversity decreased with latitude and did not differ between areas with different times of deglaciation. In accordance with previous studies, C. bigelowii and C. lugens were found to be outbreeding, while C. ensifolia and C. stans had mixed mating systems.

#Trans-Atlantic dispersal and large-scale lack of genetic structure in the circumpolar, arctic-alpine sedge Carex bigelowii s.l. (Cyperaceae)
#Schonswetter, P Elven, R Brochmann, C
#2008
--------------------------------
Paradoxically, several of the ecologically most important plant groups ill the Arctic are little understood in terms of taxonomy and biogeographic history. The circumpolar Carex bigelowii s. l. (Cyperaceae) is abundant ill the Arctic and is one of the most complicated arctic plant groups. While its ecology and population genetics have been extensively studied. its taxonomy is largely unexplored. We analyzed the large-scale geographical Structuring of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) covering most of the distribution range. We detected high levels of genetic variation. most (66%) within population, and a fairly weak genetic structure. Only the Central Asian populations, referred to as C. orbicularis. were strongly divergent. For the remaining populations, Bayesian clustering separated three distinct clusters (one European. one amphi-Atlantic. and one broadly amphi-Beringian). probably reflecting different major glacial refugia and recent transoceanic dispersal. The isolated central European populations were most closely related to those from a larger distribution area in northern Europe. Differences in genetic diversity suggest that the Alpine and Tatra populations have experienced strong bottlenecks. whereas the Krkonose Population may have been part of a continuous distribution area during the cold stages of the Pleistocene. Finally, we discuss the relevance Of our results for a uniform, range-wide taxonomic concept.
