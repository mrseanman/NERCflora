#Patterns of allozyme and morphological differentiation in the Carex flava complex (Cyperaceae) in Fennoscandia.
#Hedren, M
#2002
--------------------------------
Allozyme and morphological differentiation patterns within the Carex flava complex in Fennoscandia were described by means of multivariate analyses. As a result of these studies, and considering also data on ecology, distribution and hybridization, the following taxa were recognized: C. flava with no infraspecific taxa, C. lepidocarpa with two subspecies, ssp. lepidocarpa and ssp. jemtlandica, C. demissa with no infraspecific taxa, and C oederi with three varieties, var. oederi, var. bergrothii, and var. pulchella. Carex lepidocarpa ssp. jemtlandica was allozymically divergent from ssp. lepidocarpa, indicating a long period of isolation-of the two subspecies. A poor morphological separation in some localities is apparently due to secondary contacts in connection with recolonization of Fennoscandia after the last ice age, resulting in the formation of fertile hybrids and back-crosses. The subdivision of C. oederi into three varieties is supported by ecological data and it is suggested that they have originated by parallel ecotype formation under similar selective regimes in different areas. However, the varietal limits are not-supported by differentiation in neutral (allozyme) characters. A phylogenetic hypothesis was constructed by means of neighbour-joining based allozyme data and it was indicated that C demissa may be more closely related to C lepidocarpa than to C oederi. Previous treatments that have reduced the C. flava complex to one or two species may have been based on inappropriate species concepts, too coarse methods of analysis of morphological data, ignorance of patterns of co-occurrence and hybridization, or a combination of these factors.

#Genetic differentiation, phenotypic plasticity and adaptation in a hybridizing pair of a more common and a less common Carex species
#Schmidt, L, Schmid, B, Oja, T, Fischer, M
#2018
--------------------------------
Phenotypic variation may be genetically determined or reflect phenotypic plasticity. More common plants are expected to be less differentiated between and within regions and more adapted than less common ones. However, such differences might not develop in hybridizing species which cannot evolve completely independently. We collected 311 genets of Carex flava, 215 of C. viridula and 46 of their hybrid C.xsubviridula from 42 natural populations in cold temperate Estonia, mild temperate Lowland Switzerland and alpine Highland Switzerland. Three plantlets from each genet were planted to three experimental gardens, one in each region. We measured survival, growth, reproduction and morphological traits. The experimental transplants showed strong plasticity and grew smallest in the alpine garden. The less common C. viridula was slightly more differentiated between regions of origin than the more common C. flava and the hybrid. However, this depended on the experimental garden. Significant origin-by-garden-by-taxon and taxon-by-garden interactions suggest differential adaptation among populations and taxa. Regional differed from non-regional plants in several traits indicating both adaptations and, especially for C. viridula, maladaptations to the home regions. For C. flava, plant seed production was higher when mean annual temperature and precipitation were more similar between population of origin and garden, suggesting local adaptation to climate. Hybrids were intermediate between parental taxa or more similar to one of them, which was retained across gardens. We conclude that plasticity, genetic variation and genotype-environment interactions all contributed to regional differentiation of the closely related species. Hybridization did not completely align evolutionary patterns, and the less common species showed slightly more genetic differentiation between populations and more maladapted traits than the more common one.

#Species delimitation and the partitioning of genetic diversity - an example from the Carex flava complex (Cyperaceae).
#Hedren, M
#2004
--------------------------------
The Carex flava complex ( Cyperaceae) was used as a model system in a study of the effects of variation in species delimitation on genetic diversity estimates. The whole complex constitutes a syngameon within which gene flow may occur between taxa. Several more or less distinct evolutionary lineages in the complex are morphologically similar to each other and are often combined into broadly defined taxonomic species. Separate calculations of genetic diversity estimates for the most narrowly defined species revealed clear differences between some of the taxa; for instance, C. flava s. s. had a very low value for individual gene diversity, H-1 whereas C. hostiana and C. lepidocarpa ssp. lepidocarpa had high values for total genetic diversity, H-T Amounts of genetic diversity at different hierarchic levels ( H-T, H-S, H-I) generally increased as narrowly defined species were combined into more broadly defined species. However, combining ecological species ( ecotypes) within C. oederi s. l. had little effect on estimates of genetic diversity. The proportion of genetic diversity due to variation between populations, G(ST), increased initially as ecologically and/ or geographically separated lineages were amalgamated, but decreased as the species were even more boradly circumscribed to include distinct lineages growing in mixed populations. The proportion of genetic diversity due to variation between individuals within populations ( numerically equivalent to the inbreeding coefficient, F-IS) was dependent on the degree of hybridization and introgression at sites with mixed populations and was found to increase or decrease when taxa became more broadly circumscribed. It is concluded that differences in species circumscription may have dramatic effects on genetic diversity estimates, and it is recommended that calculations should be performed separately for separate evolutionary lineages in order to obtain comparable estimates for different plant groups.

#Genetic differentiation of Carex flava and Carex viridula in west Europe (Cyperaceae).
#Bruederle, LP, Jensen, U
#1991
--------------------------------
Recent systematic treatments evaluating variation in the Carex flava species complex have divided the West European representatives into two species, C. flava and C. viridula. These treatments contrast with previous reports that have recognized as many as nine species based upon morphological variation.  To assess the systematic relationship of C. flava and C. viridula, allozyme analyses were conducted on 34 West European populations distributed from the Alps to the Arctic Circle.  Data were obtained from electrophoresis of soluble enzymatic proteins extracted from leaf tissue.  Fifteen of the 20 presumptive loci examined for this study were found to be polymorphic; variation was distributed between the two species and within 25 populations.  These data support recognition of C. flava as a species distinct from C. viridula at a genetic identity of 0.69.  The two species are discriminated by diagnostic alleles at two loci and highly disparate allele frequencies at an additional five loci.  There is little genetic differentiation among populations of C. flava in West Europe.  Genetic identities exceeding 0.95, which were obtained from infraspecific pairwise comparisons of C. flava, do not support recognition of subspecies.  In contrast, C. viridula was highly differentiated with a G(ST) of 0.806 strongly supporting recognition of subspecies.

#Allozyme variation and racial differentiation in Swedish Carex lepidocarpa sl (Cyperaceae).
#Hedren, M, Prentice, HC
#1996
--------------------------------
Two morphological races have previously been recognized within the sedge, Carex lepidocarpa, in Sweden. These largely allopatric races are accorded specific status, as C. lepidocarpa s.s. and C. jemtlandica, in Scandinavian floras.  study of allozyme variation in populations from 80 Swedish sites supports the morphological evidence for racial differentiation within C. lepidocarpa. The two races differ from each other in terms of allele frequencies at polymorphic loci and also show different levels of within-population genetic diversity. Material that is morphologically referable to C. lepidocarpa s.s. is characterized by relatively high levels of allozyme variation, both within and between populations. Carer lepidocarpa s.s. is widespread in southern Sweden. In contrast, material that is morphologically assignable to C. jemtlandica shows low levels of within- population genetic diversity, and there is little differentiation between the geographically separated isolates of C. jemtlandica in northern Sweden and on the Baltic island of Gotland. The high degree of morphological similarity and moderate levels of genetic differentiation between the two races within C. lepidocarpa indicate that it is more appropriate to recognize the races as subspecies than as species. The low levels of genetic variation in C. jemtlandica, both within and between populations, suggest that C. jemtlandica may have arisen from C. lepidocarpa (or a near ancestor of C. lepidocarpa) as a result of population fragmentation and isolation in glacial refugia, or during the process of post-glacial colonization of Scandinavia. Lack of allozyme evidence for extensive hybridization between the two races of C. lepidocarpa, despite their ability to hybridize freely where their ranges overlap at present, supports the suggestion that the two races have had separate post-glacial histories.

#Two closely related species differ in their regional genetic differentiation despite admixing
#Schmidt, L, Fischer, M, Oja, T
#2018
--------------------------------
Regional genetic differentiation within species is often addressed in evolutionary ecology and conservation biology. Here, we address regional differentiation in two closely related hybridizing taxa, the perennial sedges Carex flava and C. viridula and their hybrid C. x subviridula in 37 populations in the north and centre of their distribution range in Europe (Estonia, Lowland (<1000 m a.s.l.) and Highland Switzerland) using 10 putative microsatellite loci. We ask whether regional differentiation was larger in the less common taxon C. viridula or whether, possibly due to hybridization, it was similar between taxa. Our results showed similar, low to moderate genetic diversity for the three studied taxa. In total, we found 12 regional species-specific alleles. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), STRUCTURE and multidimensional scaling analysis showed regional structure in genetic variation, where intraspecific differentiation between regions was lower for C. flava (AMOVA: 6.84 %) than for C. viridula (20.77 %) or C. x subviridula (18.27 %) populations. Hybrids differed from the parental taxa in the two regions where they occurred, i.e. in Estonia and Lowland Switzerland. We conclude that C. flava and C. viridula clearly differ from each other genetically, that there is pronounced regional differentiation and that, despite hybridization, this regional differentiation is more pronounced in the less common taxon, C. viridula. We encourage future studies on hybridizing taxa to work with plant populations from more than one region.
