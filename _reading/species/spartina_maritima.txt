#Genetic and epigenetic consequences of recent hybridization and polyploidy in Spartina (Poaceae)
#Salmon, A, Ainouche, ML and Wendel, JF
#2005
--------------------------------
To study the consequences of hybridization and genome duplication on polyploid genome evolution and adaptation, we used independently formed hybrids (Spartina x townsendii and Spartina x neyrautii) that originated from natural crosses between Spartina alterniflora, an American introduced species, and the European native Spartina maritima. The hybrid from England, S. x townsendii, gave rise to the invasive allopolyploid, salt-marsh species, Spartina anglica. Recent studies indicated that allopolyploid speciation may be associated with rapid genetic and epigenetic changes. To assess this in Spartina, we performed AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) and MSAP (methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism) on young hybrids and the allopolyploid. By comparing the subgenomes in the hybrids and the allopolyploid to the parental species, we inferred structural changes that arose repeatedly in the two independently formed hybrids. Surprisingly, 30% of the parental methylation patterns are altered in the hybrids and the allopolyploid. This high level of epigenetic regulation might explain the morphological plasticity of Spartina anglica and its larger ecological amplitude. Hybridization rather than genome doubling seems to have triggered most of the methylation changes observed in Spartina anglica.

--------------------------------
Spartina alterniflora, a perennial grass native to the North American Atlantic coast, was introduced during the 19th century in western Europe (Southern England and western France) where it hybridized with the native Spartina maritima. In England, the sterile hybrid S. x townsendii gave rise by chromosome doubling to the highly fertile allopolyploid Spartina anglica, which has now invaded many salt marshes and estuaries in western Europe, and has been introduced in several continents. In South-West France, another sterile hybrid was discovered in 1892 in the Bidassoa Estuary, and named Spartina x neyrautii. According to their morphology, some authors suggested that S.  neyrautii and S. x townsendii result from reciprocal crosses. During the 20th century, the hybridization site was severely disturbed, and surviving of S. x neyrautii was questioned. In this paper, various Spartina populations are investigated in the Basque region (France and Spain), and compared to the hybrid taxa formed in England (S. x townsendii an S. anglica). The samples were analyzed using molecular fingerprinting (RAPD and ISSR) and Chloroplast DNA sequence (trnL-trnT spacer, trnL intron and trnL-trnF spacer). In the Bidassoa estuary, a hybrid isolated clone has been found, that displays additive species- specific nuclear markers of S. maritima and S. alterniflora, and that is subsequently considered as a surviving clone of S. x neyrautii. The molecular analyses indicate that S.  neyrautii and S. x townsendii share the same maternal (S. alterniflora), and paternal (S. maritima) parental species, but also that the two independent hybridization events have involved different parental (nuclear) genotypes in England and in South-West France.

#Molecular evidence for the maternal parentage in the hybrid origin of Spartina anglica.
#Ferris, C, King, RA and Gray, AJ
#1997
--------------------------------
Spartina anglica is a textbook example of a natural amphiploid, which originated from hybridization between S. alterniflora and S. maritina. Which of these species was the maternal parent has remained a mystery. Inheritance of chloroplast DNA in most angiosperms is strictly maternal and can thus be used to test the parentage of hybrid taxa. The DNA sequence of the chloroplast leucine tRNA gene intron was used to show that the introduced North American S. alterniflora is the female parent of the F-1 hybrid S. x to townsendii and the amphiploid S. anglica. A possible scenario for their origin is given.

#Origin and genetic diversity of Spartina anglica (Poaceae) using nuclear DNA markers.
#Ayres DR, Strong DR
#2001
--------------------------------
Spartina alterniflora, introduced into the UK in the 1800s. Was the seed parent in an interspecific hybridization with S. maritima. The sterile F1 hybrid S. xtownsendii gave rise to the fertile allopolyploid S. anglica by chromosomal doubling. Previous chromosome, isozyme, and cpDNA surveys did not reveal notable genetic variation within either the parental or the hybrid species. We used nuclear DNA markers (random amplified polymorphic DNA ([RAPD]) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) to further explore the origin, diversity, and parentage of S. anglica. We found DNA fragments in S. xtownsendii were the aggregate of diagnostic DNA fragments from S. maritima and S. alterniflora, thus confirming its hybrid origin. The S. xtownsendii genotype was identical to most of the S. anglica individuals analyzed, establishing the genetic concordance of these two taxa. We found widespread genetic variation within S. anglica. This could indicate that S. anglica arose several times. from different S. maritima sires. Alternatively. alleles could have been lost through recombination and/or through loss of entire chromosomes in S. anglica. Finally. all but one S. anglica individual had a S. alterniflora component that was indistinguishable from a S. alterniflora plant extant in Marchwood, UK, leaving open the possibility that this plant is the actual seed parent of S. anglica.

In England, the sterile hybrid S. x townsendii gave rise by chromosome doubling to the highly fertile allopolyploid Spartina anglica, which has now invaded many salt marshes and estuaries in western Europe, and has been introduced in several continents.

The molecular analyses indicate that S.  neyrautii and S. x townsendii share the same maternal (S. alterniflora), and paternal (S. maritima) parental species, but also that the two independent hybridization events have involved different parental (nuclear) genotypes in England and in South-West France.

#Uniformity of the nuclear and chloroplast genomes of Spartina maritima (Poaceae), a salt-marsh species in decline along the Western European Coast.
#Yannic, G, Baumel, A, Ainouche, M
#2004
--------------------------------
Spartina maritima is a salt-marsh species from European and African Atlantic coasts. In the northern range of the species ( including north-west France), a rapid decline of the populations has been observed during the 20th century. In this paper, the molecular diversity of 10 populations of S. maritima from France has been investigated using nuclear and chloroplast DNA markers: inter-simple sequence polymorphism (ISSR), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD), inter- retrotransposon amplified polymorphism ( IRAP), and PCR-RFLP of a 5 kb long portion of chloroplast DNA. The results reveal an extremely low level of genetic variation in this species: only one nuclear marker ( out of 98) was polymorphic, with the presence of two genotypes randomly distributed among the populations. The lack of genetic diversity is interpreted in light of the almost exclusive vegetative propagation of the species in its northern range, the colonization history of the populations, and the origin of S. maritima ( 2n = 60) in the hexaploid lineage of the genus and in the context of the management of S. maritima populations.

#Persistence, dispersal and genetic evolution of recently formed Spartina homoploid hybrids and allopolyploids in Southern England

--------------------------------
In Southampton Water, UK, the recent (c. 150 years ago) interspecific hybridisation between Spartina alterniflora (2n = 6x = 62; A-genome) and S. maritima (2n = 6x = 60; M-genome) gave rise to the homoploid hybrid (S. x townsendii, 2n = 6x = 62), and subsequently to the invasive allododecaploid species S. anglica (2n = 12x = 120-124) that has since spread worldwide. To address the question of dynamics of mixed ploidy populations involving these plants, we analysed several Spartina populations (fifty one individuals) in Southern England, UK, one of which was the presumed place of origin of the homoploid hybrid (Hythe). Using a combination of flow cytometry and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genotyping we were able to identify the genomic composition and ploidy level of each individual analysed. The data show that the homoploid hybrid still dominates the population at Hythe (82 % of individuals collected in that locality) since its origin in the nineteenth century. We also identified S. x townsendii for the first time on Hayling Island (66 % individuals), indicating dispersal beyond its likely origin. The fertile allododecaploid S. anglica was mainly found in populations outside the initial hybridisation site, on Hayling Island and at Eling Marchwood. Quantification of the rDNA contributions from each parental genome showed that the ratios were mostly balanced in S. x townsendii. However, two (3 %) S. anglica individuals analysed have lost nearly all M-genome homeologs, indicating extensive repeat loss. Such variation indicates that despite the presumed single allopolyploid origin of S. anglica and genetic uniformity at other loci, it has undergone substantial changes at the rDNA loci following genome duplication.
