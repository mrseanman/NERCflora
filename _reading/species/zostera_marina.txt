#The Structure of Genetic Diversity in Eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) along the North Pacific and Bering Sea Coasts of Alaska
#Talbot, SL, Sage, GK, Rearick, JR, Fowler, MC, Muniz-Salazar, R, Baibak, B, Wyllie-Echeverria, S, Cabello-Pasini, A, Ward, DH

--------------------------------
Eelgrass (Zostera marina) populations occupying coastal waters of Alaska are separated by a peninsula and island archipelago into two Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs). From populations in both LMEs, we characterize genetic diversity, population structure, and polarity in gene flow using nuclear microsatellite fragment and chloroplast and nuclear sequence data. An inverse relationship between genetic diversity and latitude was observed (heterozygosity: R-2 = 0.738, P < 0.001; allelic richness: R-2 = 0.327, P = 0.047), as was significant genetic partitioning across most sampling sites (theta = 0.302, P < 0.0001). Variance in allele frequency was significantly partitioned by region only in cases when a population geographically in the Gulf of Alaska LME (Kinzarof Lagoon) was instead included with populations in the Eastern Bering Sea LME (theta(p) = 0.128-0.172; P < 0.003), suggesting gene flow between the two LMEs in this region. Gene flow among locales was rarely symmetrical, with notable exceptions generally following net coastal ocean current direction. Genetic data failed to support recent proposals that multiple Zostera species (i.e. Z. japonica and Z. angustifolia) are codistributed with Z. marina in Alaska. Comparative analyses also failed to support the hypothesis that eelgrass populations in the North Atlantic derived from eelgrass retained in northeastern Pacific Last Glacial Maximum refugia. These data suggest northeastern Pacific populations are derived from populations expanding northward from temperate populations following climate amelioration at the terminus of the last Pleistocene glaciation.

#Genetic neighbourhood of clone structures in eelgrass meadows quantified by spatial autocorrelation of microsatellite markers.
#Hammerli, A, Reusch, TBH
#2003
--------------------------------
Limited dispersal distances in plant populations frequently cause local genetic structure, which can be quantified by spatial autocorrelation. In clonal plants, three levels of spatial organization can contribute to positive autocorrelation; namely, the neighbourhood of (a) ramets, (b) clone fragments and ( c) entire clones. Here we use data from an exhaustive sampling scheme on a clonal plant to measure the contribution of the neighbourhoods of each distinct clonal structure to total spatial autocorrelation. Four plots (256 grid points each) within dense meadows of the marine clonal plant Zostera marina ( eelgrass) were sampled for clone structure with nine microsatellite markers (approximate to80 alleles). We found significant coancestry (f(ij)), at all three levels of spatial organization, even when not allowing for joins between samples of identical genets. In addition, absolute values of f(ij) and the maximum distance with significant positive f(ij) decreased with the progressive exclusion of joins between alike genotypes. The neighbourhood of this clonal plant thus consists of three levels of organization, which are reflected in different kinship structures. Each of these kinship structures may affect the level of biparental inbreeding and the physical distance between flowering shoots and their outcrossing neighbourhood. These results also emphasize the notion that spatial autocorrelation crucially depends on the scale and intensity of sampling.

#Fitness consequences of geitonogamous selfing in a clonal marine angiosperm (Zostera marina).
#Reusch, TBH
#2001
--------------------------------
Plant mating systems have received considerable attention because the proportion of selfed vs. outcrossed progeny is an important evolutionary factor. In clonally reproducing plants, geitonogamous selfing between distant ramets belonging to the same genet is expected to be widespread, yet empirical data are sparse. Nothing is known about between-ramet selfing in aquatic flowering plants with subaqueous pollen transfer, most of which display pronounced clonal reproduction. From two locations in the western Baltic Sea, I present data on the effects of patch isolation and clonal diversity on the outcrossing rate of eelgrass, Zostera marina L., based on the genotypes of maternal plants and recently fertilized ovules scored at eight microsatellite loci. There were no differences in outcrossing rates between vegetation patches and continuous meadow although patches were nearly always composed of single genets. Quantitative effects of clonal diversity were present in the continuous vegetation where a significant positive correlation between genet diversity and the proportion of outcrossed offspring was detected (Kendall's tau = 0.82, P = 0.0017). On a population-scale as well, the genotypic diversity was positively correlated with outcrossing. The relative fitness of selfed offspring was low (omega +/- 95% confidence interval = 0.56 +/- 0.032 and 0.322 +/- 0.15) indicating that geitonogamy incurred substantial fitness costs. Selfing rates in Z. marina may not be in evolutionary equilibrium because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of clonal size and diversity. The high prevalence of dioecy in seagrasses may have evolved to avoid the fitness costs associated with geitonogamy.

#New markers - old questions: population genetics of seagrasses.
#Reusch, TBH
#2001
--------------------------------
Marine angiosperms, or seagrasses, continue to be a major focus of marine biologists because of their important ecological role in many coastal ecosystems. Seagrass population biology could benefit from a population genetic perspective because genetic data enable the extraction of useful demographic information such as isolation and gene flow between demes. Moreover, population genetic processes may contribute to the growing ecological risks of local population extinction. Progress in seagrass genetics is partly driven by novel genetic markers which detect variation at the DNA level and overcome the limited polymorphism of allozymes. Key results of studies in the past decade, mostly using RAPD and microsatellites, were (1) considerable genetic and genotypic (clonal) diversity is present in several species in contrast to earlier notions of low polymorphism detected at allozyme loci, and (2) genetic differentiation among populations seems to be the rule despite earlier reports of genetic uniformity. Pronounced genetic structure was detected between populations of 4 species examined thus far (Posidonia oceanica, P, australis, Zostera marina, Thalassia testudinum). The F-ST estimates varied widely and ranged from 0.01 to 0.623 across studies and species. Genetic differentiation at a systematic range of scales was only studied in eelgrass Zostera marina, where it was positively correlated with geographic distance. The high polymorphism of RAPD or microsatellite markers will allow the augmention of indirect estimates of gene flow by methods detecting individual immigration events through paternity analysis or assignment tests. Important conservation related issues such as the level of inbreeding and the effective population size have also been obtained from genetic marker data, but results are too scarce at the moment to allow generalizations. In Zostera marina and Posidonia austrails, several population genetic attributes such as clonal diversity, mating system and effective population size varied among populations within species, highlighting that there is no 'typical' population. An important gap in our knowledge is whether the effects of natural population fragmentation and patchiness enhance the genetic isolation of populations due to anthropogenic disturbances. It is also unclear whether genetic differentiation displayed at marker loci are correlated with fitness-related plant traits, and whether genetic or genotypic diversity is important for medium- to long-term meadow persistence. An assessment of the genetic and genotypic diversity at marker loci should be combined with experiments on the ecological plasticity and reaction norms of genotypes composing the populations in question. This way, the role of genetic diversity for seagrass population maintenance and growth in the face of changing environmental conditions can be evaluated.

#A microsatellite-based estimation of clonal diversity and population subdivision in Zostera marina, a marine flowering plant.
#Reusch, TBH, Stam, WT, Olsen, JL
#2000
--------------------------------
We examined the genetic population structure in eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), the dominant seagrass species of the northern hemisphere, over spatial scales from 12 km to 10 000 km using the polymorphism of DNA microsatellites. Twelve populations were genotyped for six loci representing a total of 67 alleles. Populations sampled included the North Sea (four), the Baltic Sea (three), the western Atlantic (two), the eastern Atlantic (one), the Mediterranean Sea (one) and the eastern Pacific (one). Microsatellites revealed substantial genetic variation in a plant group with low allozyme diversity. Average expected heterozygosities per population (monoclonal populations excluded) ranged from 0.32 to 0.61 (mean = 0.48) and allele numbers varied between 3.3 and 6.7 (mean = 4.7). Using the expected frequency of multilocus genotypes within populations, we distinguished ramets from genetic individuals (i.e. equivalent to clones). Differences in clonal diversity among populations varied widely and ranged from maximal diversity (i.e. all ramets with different genotype) to near or total monoclonality (two populations). All multiple sampled ramets were excluded from further analysis of genetic differentiation within and between populations. All but one population were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, indicating that Zostera marina is predominantly outcrossing. From a regression of the pairwise population differentiation with distance, we obtained an effective population size N-e of 2440-5000. The overall genetic differentiation among eelgrass populations, assessed as rho (a standardized estimate of Slatkin's R-ST) was 0.384 (95% CI 0.34-0.44, P < 0.001). Genetic differentiation was weak among three North Sea populations situated 12-42 km distant from one another, suggesting that tidal currents result in an efficient exchange of propagules. In the Baltic and in Nova Scotia, a small but statistically significant fraction of the genetic variance was distributed between populations (rho = 0.029-0.053) at scales of 15-35 km. Pairwise genetic differentiation between European populations were correlated with distance between populations up to a distance of 4500 km (linear differentiation-by-distance model, R-2 = 0.67). In contrast, both Nova Scotian populations were genetically much closer to North Sea and Baltic populations than expected from their geographical distance (pairwise rho = 0.03-0.08, P < 0.01). A biogeographical cluster of Canadian with Baltic/North Sea populations was also supported using a neighbour-joining tree based on Cavalli-Sforza's chord distance. Relatedness between populations may be very different from predictions based on geographical vicinity.

#Estimates of outcrossing rates and of inbreeding depression in a population of the marine angiosperm Zostera marina.
#Ruckelshaus, MH
#1995
--------------------------------
Despite the great diversity of pollination and fertilization mechanisms observed in marine plants, little is known about the causes or maintenance of this variation. In this study, I estimated outcrossing rates and levels of inbreeding depression in Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), providing the first empirical test of hypotheses about the evolution of breeding systems in plants with submerged flowers. This study also addressed temporal separation of female and male flowering (dichogamy) in eelgrass as a mechanism promoting an outcrossing mating system, and whether the mating system in eelgrass is related to the degree of dichogamy in the held. Outcrossing rates (0 < t < 1) estimated from two polymorphic allozyme loci indicate that the Z. marina population in intertidal and subtidal habitats in False Bay, Washington, USA, was highly outcrossing in both 1991 (intertidal t = 0.905, subtidal I = 1.0) and 1992 (intertidal t = 0.775, subtidal t = 0.611). The outcrossing rates were positively associated with the degree of dichogamy in 1992; intertidal plants exhibited a greater temporal separation of female and male flowering and a higher outcrossing rate than did subtidal plants. Inbreeding depression at seed set was estimated from hand pollinations (self- and outcross) on 20 reproductive individuals from the False Bay population. Averaged across all maternal parents, a greater proportion of outcrossed flowers set seed than selfed flowers; i.e,, inbreeding depression was detected. Plants exhibited genetic variation for inbreeding depression, detected as a significant pollination treatment x maternal family interaction in a log- likelihood analysis. By the end of the seed-maturation period (7 mo after initial seed set) some families showed outbreeding depression, i.e., greater fitness in progeny derived from selfing than in progeny from outcrossing. The inbreeding depression in the False Bay population may be an important selective factor contributing to the maintenance of dichogamy and an outcrossing mating system, as proposed for aquatic plants.

#Estimation of genetic neighborhood parameters from pollen and seed dispersal in the marine angiosperm Zostera marina L..
#Ruckelshaus, MH
#1996
--------------------------------
The relative importance of random genetic drift and local adaptation in causing population substructuring in plant species remains an important empirical question. Here I estimate the effective size of the genetic neighborhood, N-b, as a means of evaluating the likely role of genetic drift in creating genetic differentiation within a population of a marine plant, Zostera marina L. (eelgrass). Calculations of effective neighborhood size are based on field estimates of pollen and seed-dispersal distributions, an electrophoretic estimate of the mating system using open-pollinated progeny arrays, and determination of the effective density of reproductive individuals in the population. Neighborhood area calculated from the parent-offspring dispersal variances was equal to N-a = 524 m(2); variance in the seed-dispersal distribution contributes more than twice as much as variance in pollen dispersal to N-a. Including an outcrossing rate slightly different from random, estimated neighborhood size for Z. marina is N-b = 6255. This estimate is one of the largest reported for plants or animals and indicates that genetic drift in small neighborhoods is highly unlikely to cause genetic substructuring in the study population. High gene-flow levels provided by the marine environment appear to prevent genetic isolation by distance among eelgrass patches, but the importance of drift through founder events in this population characterized by high patch turnover cannot be discounted and is the subject of ongoing study.

#Genetic diversity and structure of natural and transplanted eelgrass populations in the Chesapeake and Chincoteague bays.
#Williams, SL, Orth, RJ
#1998
--------------------------------
The objective of this study was to gain baseline population data on the genetic diversity and differentiation of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) populations in the Chesapeake and Chincoteague bays. Natural and transplanted eelgrass beds were compared using starch gel electrophoresis of allozymes. Transplanted eelgrass beds were not reduced in genetic diversity compared with natural beds. Inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) indicated that transplanted eelgrass beds had theoretically higher levels of outcrossing than natural beds, suggesting the significance of use of seeds as donor material and of seedling recruitment following transplantation diebacks. Natural populations exhibited very great genetic structure (F- ST = 0.335), but transplanted beds were genetically similar to the donor bed and each other. Genetic diversity was loir est in Chincoteague Bay, reflecting recent restoration history since the 1930s wasting disease and geographical isolation from other east coast populations. These data provide a basis for developing a management plan for conserving eelgrass genetic diversity in the Chesapeake Bay and for guiding estuary-wide restoration efforts. It will be important to recognize that the natural genetic diversity of eelgrass in the estuary is distributed among various populations and is not web represented by single populations.

#Floral neighbourhoods in the sea: how floral density, opportunity for outcrossing and population fragmentation affect seed set in Zostera marina.
#Reusch, TBH
#2003
--------------------------------
1 Almost nothing is known about how the floral neighbourhood affects reproductive output in plants with subaqueous pollination (hydrophily), such as seagrasses, an ecologically important group of some 60 marine angiosperms. 2 I studied how floral density, genetic diversity and population fragmentation affect seed set in Zostera marina (eelgrass), a functionally hermaphrodite seagrass with extensive clonal propagation. 3 In a field experiment in the south-western Baltic Sea, I increased or decreased the density of flowering shoots in 6 x 6 m plots. Early seed set was a positive, saturation-type function of density suggesting pollen limitation below approximately 5 flowering shoots m(-2) . 4 Using molecular markers, I determined local genotypic diversity and outcrossing rates as indicators of outcrossing opportunities. I found only non-significant effects of these variables on early seed set, suggesting that density of the floral neighbourhood is more important than genetic composition. 5 Early seed set was 22% lower in isolated vegetation patches compared to continuous eelgrass meadow (> 50 m(2) ). 6 Given the spatial scale of the observed pollen limitation, and low natural densities of flowering shoots in the field, pollen limitation may be widespread in Z. marina and, possibly, other plant species with subaqueous pollination.

#Genetic sub-structure and intermediate optimal outcrossing distance in the marine angiosperm Zostera marina
#Billingham, MR Simoes, T Reusch, TBH Serrao, EA
#2007
--------------------------------
The spatial distribution of genetic variability depends on the spatial patterns of clonal and sexual reproduction, gene flow, genetic drift and natural selection. Species with restricted dispersal may exhibit genetic structuring within populations with immediate neighbours being close relatives, and may show differentiation among populations. Genetic structuring of a species may have important genetic, evolutionary and ecological consequences including distance-dependent mating success. In this study we used microsatellite markers to show that clones of Zostera marina in a population in the Ria Formosa, Portugal, were aggregated and covered distances of up to 3-4 m. Clones within 4 m of each other exhibited significant and positive coancestry values, reflecting the limited seed dispersal of this species. Hand-pollinations between near (0-10.9 m), intermediate (11-32 m) and far (15 km) individuals resulted in similar levels of seed set, although the near pollinations had higher, although not statistically significant, levels of seed abortion during maturation. Seeds from intermediate-distance pollinations had a significantly higher proportion of seeds germinate and shorter germination time than both the near and far seeds. Similarly, the average number of seedlings produced per pollination, used as an overall estimate of fitness, was significantly greater for the intermediate distance when compared to both near and far pollinations. These results suggest that the genetic structuring observed may result in both inbreeding and outbreeding depression, which gives rise to an intermediate optimal outcrossing distance

#Ecological impacts of genotypic diversity in the clonal seagrass Zostera marina
#Hughes, AR Stachowicz, JJ
#2009
--------------------------------
Genetic diversity, like species diversity, can have important
 consequences for communities and ecosystems. However, little is known
 about whether the effects of genetic diversity demonstrated in
 experimental assemblages are of sufficient strength to generate
 patterns in natural systems. We conducted a survey of eelgrass (Zostera
 marina) to examine the correlation between eelgrass clonal diversity
 and two metrics of community structure across two seasons: shoot
 density (reflective of habitat quality) and biomass of epiphytic algae
 (as a measure of food resource availability). Eelgrass clonal diversity
 was not related to epiphyte biomass in either winter or summer.
 Interestingly, there was a positive relationship between eelgrass
 clonal diversity and shoot density only in the winter, when eelgrass
 experiences stress from abiotic and biotic factors. The magnitude of
 this correlation was similar to that of other factors known to affect
 shoot density such as tidal elevation or position in the bed. In
 contrast, summer shoot density and diversity were uncorrelated. This
 natural pattern is consistent with previous experimental results in
 which diversity positively affected shoot density only during periods
 of abiotic or biotic stress, suggesting that the effects of clonal
 diversity are sufficiently strong to influence shoot density in the
 field, despite the presence of potentially confounding environmental
 gradients.

#Zostera marina population genetics in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, and implications for grass bed restoration
#Campanella JJ, Bologna PAX, Smith SM, Rosenzweig EB, Smalley JV
#2010
--------------------------------
Within Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, Zostera marina populations have declined by 62% over the last 20 years, and restoration efforts have met with mixed success. We have completed a microsatellite-based genetic investigation of eight populations of Z. marina within Barnegat Bay to determine whether the genetic stock origins of the plants used in management projects may affect restoration success. Additionally, we assessed the genetic diversity of Z. marina in Barnegat Bay to better understand its population structure. Clonal diversity ranged from 0.70 to 0.95 for the populations studied. Individually, Barnegat Bay populations are not genetically diverse, and there is also little divergence among populations. The Atlantic populations had mean Hobs values (0.20-0.34) that were far lower than the Hexp values (0.69-0.83). Also, the F (IS) values in all of the eastern populations indicate a surfeit of homozygotes over heterozygotes, suggesting a low degree of outcrossing in the Barnegat Bay populations. Six of the ten populations studied (Ham Island, Manahawkin Bay, Shelter Island, Marsh Elder, Harvey Cedar Sedge, and Long Island) show evidence of historical bottlenecks. Mean estimated F (ST) values would suggest that most alleles are undergoing moderate genetic differentiation, with values that range from 0.06 to 0.13. Oyster Creek and Sedge Island demonstrate the largest estimated effective population sizes and may be the most appropriate populations for use in future eelgrass restoration projects.

#Transcriptomic resilience to global warming in the seagrass Zostera marina, a marine foundation species
#Franssen SU, Gu J, Bergmann N, Winters G, Klostermeier UC, Rosenstiel P, Bornberg-Bauer E, Reusch TBH
#2011
--------------------------------
Large-scale transcription profiling via direct cDNA sequencing provides important insights as to how foundation species cope with increasing climatic extremes predicted under global warming. Species distributed along a thermal cline, such as the ecologically important seagrass Zostera marina, provide an opportunity to assess temperature effects on gene expression as a function of their long-term adaptation to heat stress. We exposed a southern and northern European population of Zostera marina from contrasting thermal environments to a realistic heat wave in a common-stress garden. In a fully crossed experiment, eight cDNA libraries, each comprising similar to 125 000 reads, were obtained during and after a simulated heat wave, along with nonstressed control treatments. Although gene-expression patterns during stress were similar in both populations and were dominated by classical heat-shock proteins, transcription profiles diverged after the heat wave. Gene-expression patterns in southern genotypes returned to control values immediately, but genotypes from the northern site failed to recover and revealed the induction of genes involved in protein degradation, indicating failed metabolic compensation to high sea-surface temperature. We conclude that the return of gene-expression patterns during recovery provides critical information on thermal adaptation in aquatic habitats under climatic stress. As a unifying concept for ecological genomics, we propose transcriptomic resilience, analogous to ecological resilience, as an important measure to predict the tolerance of individuals and hence the fate of local populations in the face of global warming.

#Isolation and characterization of microsatellite markers for Zostera marina and their cross-species amplification in Zostera caespitosa
#Peng, J., L. Zhang, X. Jiang, C. Cui, R. Wu, and J. Zhao
#2012
--------------------------------
Zostera marina is the most wide-ranging marine flowering plant in Northern Hemisphere. It helps to physically form the habitat and provides food for a variety of marine organisms. Nineteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed and characterized in 45 individuals from Shandong Peninsula (Northwest Pacific). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 6. The observed and expected heterozygosity per locus ranged from 0.11 to 0.83 and from 0.11 to 0.74, respectively. Two loci were deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and in linkage disequilibrium, respectively. Only one locus (Pzm75) showed evidence for null alleles. Twelve loci were cross-species amplification in a vulnerable seagrass species Zostera caespitosa.

#Distinguishing morphologically similar Zostera species (Z. caespitosa and Z. marina) using microsatellite DNA markers on leaf fragments
#Jiang, Xin, Peng, Jie, Zhang, Linan, Cui, Cuiju, Tian, Pingping, Li, Xiaojie, Zhang, Xiumei, Gao, Tianxiang
#2013
--------------------------------
In this study, 26 published microsatellite DNA markers, which were originally developed for Zostera marina, were employed to distinguish between 57 Z. marina and 49 Zostera caespitosa samples collected from different submerged meadows on the coasts of Northeastern China. Eight of these markers were suitable for cross-species analysis. On the basis of the data obtained from these loci, all of the Z. marina and Z. caespitosa samples were correctly assigned to the cluster of their species in the assignment test. Using PCR amplification, 4 of the 26 markers were positive for Z marina and negative for Z. caespitosa. We found that both the assignment test with 8 loci and PCR with 4 loci were efficient in distinguishing between the two sympatric species, which was previously only achieved by scientific divers.

#Phylogeographic differentiation versus transcriptomic adaptation to warm temperatures in Zostera marina, a globally important seagrass
#Jueterbock, A, Franssen, SU, Bergmann, N, Gu, J, Coyer, JA, Reusch, TBH, Bornberg-Bauer, E, Olsen, JL
#2016
--------------------------------
Populations distributed across a broad thermal cline are instrumental in addressing adaptation to increasing temperatures under global warming. Using a space-for-time substitution design, we tested for parallel adaptation to warm temperatures along two independent thermal clines in Zostera marina, the most widely distributed seagrass in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. A North-South pair of populations was sampled along the European and North American coasts and exposed to a simulated heatwave in a common-garden mesocosm. Transcriptomic responses under control, heat stress and recovery were recorded in 99 RNAseq libraries with similar to 13 000 uniquely annotated, expressed genes. We corrected for phylogenetic differentiation among populations to discriminate neutral from adaptive differentiation. The two southern populations recovered faster from heat stress and showed parallel transcriptomic differentiation, as compared with northern populations. Among 2389 differentially expressed genes, 21 exceeded neutral expectations and were likely involved in parallel adaptation to warm temperatures. However, the strongest differentiation following phylogenetic correction was between the three Atlantic populations and the Mediterranean population with 128 of 4711 differentially expressed genes exceeding neutral expectations. Although adaptation to warm temperatures is expected to reduce sensitivity to heatwaves, the continued resistance of seagrass to further anthropogenic stresses may be impaired by heat-induced downregulation of genes related to photosynthesis, pathogen defence and stress tolerance.

#The Structure of Genetic Diversity in Eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) along the North Pacific and Bering Sea Coasts of Alaska
#Talbot, SL, Sage, GK, Rearick, JR, Fowler, MC, Muniz-Salazar, R, Baibak, B, Wyllie-Echeverria, S, Cabello-Pasini, A, Ward, DH
#2016
--------------------------------
Eelgrass (Zostera marina) populations occupying coastal waters of Alaska are separated by a peninsula and island archipelago into two Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs). From populations in both LMEs, we characterize genetic diversity, population structure, and polarity in gene flow using nuclear microsatellite fragment and chloroplast and nuclear sequence data. An inverse relationship between genetic diversity and latitude was observed (heterozygosity: R-2 = 0.738, P < 0.001; allelic richness: R-2 = 0.327, P = 0.047), as was significant genetic partitioning across most sampling sites (theta = 0.302, P < 0.0001). Variance in allele frequency was significantly partitioned by region only in cases when a population geographically in the Gulf of Alaska LME (Kinzarof Lagoon) was instead included with populations in the Eastern Bering Sea LME (theta(p) = 0.128-0.172; P < 0.003), suggesting gene flow between the two LMEs in this region. Gene flow among locales was rarely symmetrical, with notable exceptions generally following net coastal ocean current direction. Genetic data failed to support recent proposals that multiple Zostera species (i.e. Z. japonica and Z. angustifolia) are codistributed with Z. marina in Alaska. Comparative analyses also failed to support the hypothesis that eelgrass populations in the North Atlantic derived from eelgrass retained in northeastern Pacific Last Glacial Maximum refugia. These data suggest northeastern Pacific populations are derived from populations expanding northward from temperate populations following climate amelioration at the terminus of the last Pleistocene glaciation.

#The importance of reproductive strategies in population genetic approaches to conservation: an example from the marine angiosperm genus Zostera
#Provan, J Wilson, S Portig, AA Maggs, CA
#2008
--------------------------------
Knowledge of the levels of genetic diversity maintained in natural populations can play a central role in conservation programmes, particularly in threatened habitats or species. Fluctuations in population size can lead to loss of variation and, consequently, increase the risk of extinction. We have examined whether such a genetic bottleneck has occurred in populations of two species in the seagrass genus Zostera, which are believed to have been affected by an outbreak of wasting disease at the start of the last century. A test for heterozygote excess at five nuclear microsatellite loci did not suggest the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck, but analysis of seven chloroplast microsatellite loci and sequence data from two regions did suggest a bottleneck in the chloroplast genome. Extremely low levels of between-population diversity suggest that all subpopulations can be treated as a single management unit for each species. Comparable levels of nuclear genetic diversity were found in the three populations of the primarily sexual Zostera marina var. angustifolia studied but a wider range of within-population diversity was found in Zostera noltii, which displays both. sexual and vegetative reproductive strategies. This may be due to an increase in sexual recruitment due to localised fresh water inflow into the study site near to the most diverse population. Such populations should be prioritised as source material for any replanting or remediation due to natural or anthropogenic loss of Zostera beds in the area.

#Is asexual reproduction more important at geographical limits? A genetic study of the seagrass Zostera marina in the Ria Formosa, Portugal.
#Billingham, MR, Reusch, TBH, Alberto, F, Serrao, EA
#2003
--------------------------------
In populations of species that are able to reproduce both sexually and asexually, there may be local differences with regard to the relative importance of the 2 modes of reproduction. Studies of plant species with such a life history have shown that the contribution of sexual reproduction to population maintenance may be lower at the geographical margins, with genotypic diversity often used as an indicator of the relative importance of vegetative and sexual reproduction. This hypothesis was examined in a collection of samples of eelgrass Zostera marina (a marine flowering plant) from its eastern Atlantic southern limit (Ria Formosa, Portugal). Samples from 12 sites were genotyped using 9 microsatellite loci to compare within-site clonal and genetic diversity, and among-site distribution of genetic diversity, with previously published values from central sites. Sites within the Ria Formosa had lower clonal diversities (mean = 0.29, range = 0.07 to 0.68) than the central sites (mean = 0.86, range = 0.33 to 1.00), lower levels of expected heterozygosity (H-e = 0.423 vs 0.486) and exhibited heterozygote excesses rather than deficits. Similarly, genetic differentiation was found to be much greater in the Ria Formosa, with the F-ST of 0.233 being over 10-fold greater than that reported for populations in the Baltic Sea. Results from this study were consistent with previous findings of reduced sexual reproduction, genotypic diversity and among-population gene flow at species limits.

#Intraspecific variation in isozyme patterns of phenotypically separated populations of Zostera marina L. in the south-western Netherlands.
#Deheij, H, Nienhuis, PH
#1992
--------------------------------
Electrophoresis was used to examine the genetic variation within natural populations of eelgrass Zostera marina L. from lagoons and estuaries in the south-western Netherlands and from Roscoff, Brittany, France. Until now, no data on isozyme variation in eelgrass from the Atlantic coast of Europe were available. 21 enzyme systems were tested from which 12 showed a banding pattern on the Tris-citrate, Ph 7, gel/buffer system used. Only peroxidase (PER) proved to be clearly polymorphic and showed variation between the five ecologically more or less isolated populations examined. The three nontidal populations of the south-western Netherlands showed > 98% similarity but are nevertheless morphologically and ecologically separated from each other. The Dutch tidal population, Zandkreek, is genetically slightly separated from the nontidal populations (similarity 93%), and the geographically isolated Roscoff population showed the lowest similarity of 79%. There appears to be little similarity in differentiation at the isozyme level, compared with the differentiation at the morphological and ecological level. It is likely that phenotypic variation found in plant morphology, biomass allocation and the ratio between perennial and annual offspring along the coast of the Netherlands should for the greater part be attributed to environmental factors and not to genetic differentiation.

#Characterization of disjunct populations of Zostera marina (eelgrass) from California - genetic-differences resolved by restriction-fragment-length-polymorphisms.
#Fain, SR, Detomaso, A, Alberte, RS
#1992
--------------------------------
Comparative restriction-fragment analysis was used to analyze the nuclear ribosomal DNA, and alcohol dehydrogenase-1 loci of Zostera marina L., for variation within and among populations. Eelgrass is a perennial marine flowering plant that is widespread and ecologically significant throughout the temperate northern hemisphere. A chemical method was developed to obtain restriction-quality DNA without CsCl fractionation from experimentally relevant quantities of seagrass tissues (0.5 to 1.0 g). The yield was 25-mu-g g-1 fresh weight. The three morphologically distinct forms of Z. marina from disjunct populations examined in this study were found to be genetically distinct; morphologically similar populations were indistinguishable genetically. Genetic distinction also correlated with habitat depth, as subtidal and intertidal populations were clearly divergent. Homologous probes for the 17S and 28S ribosomal DNA genes were used to map 24 restriction sites on the rDNA repeat of Z. marina, which was determined to be about 14 kb in length. At least 1 length mutation and 5 restriction-site changes were identified that distinguished Z. marina populations from San Diego and Monterey Bay (Del Monte Beach) from Z. marina populations from Elkhorn Slough and Tomales Bay. Estimated sequence variation (100 x p) between eelgrass populations ranged from 0.00 to 0.69. Individual plants were observed to contain as many as four different rDNA- repeat length variants. The mean number of rDNA-repeat length variants per individual in Z. marina was about two. Intrapopulation variation in rDNA-repeat type was observed in only one individual from the Tomales Bay population.

#Genetic neighbourhood of clone structures in eelgrass meadows quantified by spatial autocorrelation of microsatellite markers.
#Hammerli, A, Reusch, TBH
#2003
--------------------------------
Limited dispersal distances in plant populations frequently cause local genetic structure, which can be quantified by spatial autocorrelation. In clonal plants, three levels of spatial organization can contribute to positive autocorrelation; namely, the neighbourhood of (a) ramets, (b) clone fragments and ( c) entire clones. Here we use data from an exhaustive sampling scheme on a clonal plant to measure the contribution of the neighbourhoods of each distinct clonal structure to total spatial autocorrelation. Four plots (256 grid points each) within dense meadows of the marine clonal plant Zostera marina ( eelgrass) were sampled for clone structure with nine microsatellite markers (approximate to80 alleles). We found significant coancestry (f(ij)), at all three levels of spatial organization, even when not allowing for joins between samples of identical genets. In addition, absolute values of f(ij) and the maximum distance with significant positive f(ij) decreased with the progressive exclusion of joins between alike genotypes. The neighbourhood of this clonal plant thus consists of three levels of organization, which are reflected in different kinship structures. Each of these kinship structures may affect the level of biparental inbreeding and the physical distance between flowering shoots and their outcrossing neighbourhood. These results also emphasize the notion that spatial autocorrelation crucially depends on the scale and intensity of sampling.

#Phylogenetic analyses of Zostera species based on rbcL and matK nucleotide sequences: Implications for the origin and diversification of seagrasses in Japanese waters.
#Kato, Y, Aioi, K, Omori, Y, Takahata, N, Satta, Y
#2003
--------------------------------
Seagrasses are composed of four families belonging to angiosperms and they are thought to become adaptive to aquatic life independently. Zosteraceae is one such family and because of the relatively high species diversity around Japan and Korea coast areas, the family might have arisen therefrom. To elucidate the origin and evolution of Zosteraceae which consists of three genera, Phyllospadix, Zostera, and Heterozostera, 2.8 kb nucleotide sequences of rbcL and matK genes in the chloroplast genome were examined for various species, including cosmopolitan Z. marina and endemic Z. caulescens. The phylogenetic analysis reveals the following three features. First, based on the synonymous nucleotide substitution rate of the rice chloroplast genome, we estimated the divergence times between Zosteraceae and its closest relative, Potamogetonaceae, and between different genera, Zostera and Phyllospadix, as approximately 100 million years (myr) and 36 myr, respectively, suggesting that Zosteraceae emerged somewhere in the period from 36 myr ago to 100 myr ago. Second, two subgenera of Zostera, Zostera and Zosterella, exhibit their reciprocal monophyly and appear to have differentiated from each other approximately 33 myr ago. However, the third genus Heterozostera branched off only 5 myr ago from the stem lineage leading to Zosterella and this seems too recent in comparison with the ancient divergence of the two subgenera. Third, we estimated the most recent common ancestor of subgenus Zostera as 6 myr. In Z. marina four haplotypes were found in the sample and have diversified in the past 1.5 myr. One haplotype is shared by both sides of the Japan Archipelago and its closely related haplotypes occur also in eastern Pacific Ocean. Based on these phylogeographic analyses, we propose a provisional age related classification of Zosteraceae to argue the origin and evolution.

#Fitness consequences of geitonogamous selfing in a clonal marine angiosperm (Zostera marina).
#Reusch, TBH
#2001
--------------------------------
Plant mating systems have received considerable attention because the proportion of selfed vs. outcrossed progeny is an important evolutionary factor. In clonally reproducing plants, geitonogamous selfing between distant ramets belonging to the same genet is expected to be widespread, yet empirical data are sparse. Nothing is known about between-ramet selfing in aquatic flowering plants with subaqueous pollen transfer, most of which display pronounced clonal reproduction. From two locations in the western Baltic Sea, I present data on the effects of patch isolation and clonal diversity on the outcrossing rate of eelgrass, Zostera marina L., based on the genotypes of maternal plants and recently fertilized ovules scored at eight microsatellite loci. There were no differences in outcrossing rates between vegetation patches and continuous meadow although patches were nearly always composed of single genets. Quantitative effects of clonal diversity were present in the continuous vegetation where a significant positive correlation between genet diversity and the proportion of outcrossed offspring was detected (Kendall's tau = 0.82, P = 0.0017). On a population-scale as well, the genotypic diversity was positively correlated with outcrossing. The relative fitness of selfed offspring was low (omega +/- 95% confidence interval = 0.56 +/- 0.032 and 0.322 +/- 0.15) indicating that geitonogamy incurred substantial fitness costs. Selfing rates in Z. marina may not be in evolutionary equilibrium because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of clonal size and diversity. The high prevalence of dioecy in seagrasses may have evolved to avoid the fitness costs associated with geitonogamy.

#New markers - old questions: population genetics of seagrasses.
#Reusch, TBH
#2001
--------------------------------
Marine angiosperms, or seagrasses, continue to be a major focus of marine biologists because of their important ecological role in many coastal ecosystems. Seagrass population biology could benefit from a population genetic perspective because genetic data enable the extraction of useful demographic information such as isolation and gene flow between demes. Moreover, population genetic processes may contribute to the growing ecological risks of local population extinction. Progress in seagrass genetics is partly driven by novel genetic markers which detect variation at the DNA level and overcome the limited polymorphism of allozymes. Key results of studies in the past decade, mostly using RAPD and microsatellites, were (1) considerable genetic and genotypic (clonal) diversity is present in several species in contrast to earlier notions of low polymorphism detected at allozyme loci, and (2) genetic differentiation among populations seems to be the rule despite earlier reports of genetic uniformity. Pronounced genetic structure was detected between populations of 4 species examined thus far (Posidonia oceanica, P, australis, Zostera marina, Thalassia testudinum). The F-ST estimates varied widely and ranged from 0.01 to 0.623 across studies and species. Genetic differentiation at a systematic range of scales was only studied in eelgrass Zostera marina, where it was positively correlated with geographic distance. The high polymorphism of RAPD or microsatellite markers will allow the augmention of indirect estimates of gene flow by methods detecting individual immigration events through paternity analysis or assignment tests. Important conservation related issues such as the level of inbreeding and the effective population size have also been obtained from genetic marker data, but results are too scarce at the moment to allow generalizations. In Zostera marina and Posidonia austrails, several population genetic attributes such as clonal diversity, mating system and effective population size varied among populations within species, highlighting that there is no 'typical' population. An important gap in our knowledge is whether the effects of natural population fragmentation and patchiness enhance the genetic isolation of populations due to anthropogenic disturbances. It is also unclear whether genetic differentiation displayed at marker loci are correlated with fitness-related plant traits, and whether genetic or genotypic diversity is important for medium- to long-term meadow persistence. An assessment of the genetic and genotypic diversity at marker loci should be combined with experiments on the ecological plasticity and reaction norms of genotypes composing the populations in question. This way, the role of genetic diversity for seagrass population maintenance and growth in the face of changing environmental conditions can be evaluated.

#Microsatellites reveal high population connectivity in eelgrass (Zostera marina) in two contrasting coastal areas.
#Reusch, TBH
#2002
--------------------------------
Populations of marine angiosperms, or seagrasses, are at the basis of productive ecosystems thriving in shallow coastal areas around the world. Genetic markers allow important inferences on the connectivity of seagrass populations. Here, I compare the fine scale geographic structure in eelgrass (Zostera marina) at a regional scale (2-60 km) among two adjacent coastal areas. the northern Wadden Sea (N = 8), and the southwestern Baltic (N = 5). Plants were genotyped for eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci displaying a total of 114 alleles. Consistent with their clonal mode of reproduction, populations in the Baltic were genetically less diverse compared to those in the Wadden Sea, suggesting an effective population size that is half compared to the Wadden Sea. Although I expected more gene flow among populations in the Wadden Sea where abundant seeds can be transported by strong tidal currents, no quantitative difference in population differentiation was detectable between built coastal areas. To the contrary, in the atidal Baltic, nonsignificant genetic differentiation (F-ST < 0.009) was present up to waterway distances of 54 km, compared to only 33 km in the Wadden Sea. Correlations between genetic and geographic distances were weak in both areas, and significant only in the Wadden Sea.  examined as one potential mechanism responsible for high population connectivity whether the genotypic composition of rafting reproductive shoots differed from resident Baltic populations (N = 2) using assignment tests. At one sampling occasion, at least 130 immigrant seeds m(-1) shoreline were identified based on their multilocus genotype. The results have implications for coastal management and restoration and suggest that local population history may be less crucial for explaining seagrass distribution than previously suggested.

#Differentiating between clonal growth and limited gene flow using spatial autocorrelation of microsatellites.
#Reusch, TBH, Hukriede, W, Stam, WT, Olsen, JL
#1999
--------------------------------
In plant populations alleles often deviate from a random distribution and reveal positive autocorrelation at short distances. In species with both clonal and sexual reproduction, such clustering may be because ramets of the same genet were sampled at nearby locations. Alternatively, clustering may be the result of limited gene flow through pollen or seeds (isolation-by-distance). Were, we modify a conventional spatial autocorrelation analysis using the join-count statistic in order to differentiate between these two causes of genetic structure. We examined the distribution of seven microsatellite loci representing 37 alleles in a 20 x 80 m plot of a perennial population of eelgrass Zostera marina L. In analysing join- counts between all like genotypes we found significant genetic autocorrelation among ramets at distances between 1 and 7 m (P < 0.001). We then excluded joins between clonemates which were identified from the expected likelihood of their seven-locus genotypes. Without joins within genets, no autocorrelation was evident, indicating that most of the significant genetic clustering was caused by clonal spread. At distances up to 27 m, alleles were distributed at random, indicating a panmictic population at this spatial scale. These results illustrate the need for an a priori estimation of genet-ramet structure in clonally reproducing plants in order to avoid erroneous inferences about putative gene flow at various spatial scales.

#Microsatellite loci in eelgrass Zostera marina reveal marked polymorphism within and among populations.
#Reusch, TBH, Stam, WT, Olsen, JL
#1999
--------------------------------
Using an enriched genomic library, we developed seven (CT)(n)/(GA)(n) microsatellite loci for eelgrass Zostera marina L. Enrichment is described and highly recommended for genomes in which microsatellites are rare, such as in many plants.  test for polymorphism was performed on individuals from three geographically separated populations (N = 15/population) and revealed considerable genetic variation. The number of alleles per locus varied between five and 11 and the observed heterozygosities for single loci ranged from 0.16 to 0.81 within populations. Mean allele lengths were markedly different among populations, indicating that the identified loci will be useful in studying population structure in Z. marina. As the frequency of the most abundant multilocus genotype within populations was always < 1%, these loci have sufficient resolving power to address clone size in predominantly vegetatively reproducing populations.

#Size and estimated age of genets in eelgrass, Zostera marina, assessed with microsatellite markers.
#Reusch, TBH, Stam, WT, Olsen, JL
#1999
--------------------------------
We examined the spatial distribution of genotypes in a perennial population of eelgrass, Zostera marina L., at two spatial scales. We mapped and sampled 80 ramets in a subtidal area of 20 x 80 m, and an additional 15 ramets in two 1-m(2) sub-quadrats. Ramets were genotyped for seven polymorphic microsatellite loci. Among a total number of 54 genotypes detected, 12 occurred more than once. The ramets of ten of these genotypes occurred in clusters and represented genets based on their expected multi-locus genotype frequencies. The size distribution of genets was uneven with estimated ramet numbers ranging from 2 to 5000. Whereas some areas displayed a high genet diversity, which may indicate past disturbances, large genets (greater than or equal to 10 m(2)) predominated in other locations of the sampled plot. Spatial heterogeneity in clone distribution was also obvious at the smaller sampling scale (15 ramets sam.. pled within m(2)) were the clonal diversity (genets identified/ramets sampled) was 0.24 in one quadrat, and 0.077 in the ether. Ramets belonging to the largest clone were maximally 17 In apart, which corresponds to a genet age of 67 yr based on annual rhizome growth rates. We conclude that the spatial arrangement of clones in seagrasses allows inferences about the past demography and the disturbance regime at a given site which may prove useful for coastal zone management of ecologically valuable seagrass meadows.

#A microsatellite-based estimation of clonal diversity and population subdivision in Zostera marina, a marine flowering plant.
#Reusch, TBH, Stam, WT, Olsen, JL
#2000
--------------------------------
We examined the genetic population structure in eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), the dominant seagrass species of the northern hemisphere, over spatial scales from 12 km to 10 000 km using the polymorphism of DNA microsatellites. Twelve populations were genotyped for six loci representing a total of 67 alleles. Populations sampled included the North Sea (four), the Baltic Sea (three), the western Atlantic (two), the eastern Atlantic (one), the Mediterranean Sea (one) and the eastern Pacific (one). Microsatellites revealed substantial genetic variation in a plant group with low allozyme diversity. Average expected heterozygosities per population (monoclonal populations excluded) ranged from 0.32 to 0.61 (mean = 0.48) and allele numbers varied between 3.3 and 6.7 (mean = 4.7). Using the expected frequency of multilocus genotypes within populations, we distinguished ramets from genetic individuals (i.e. equivalent to clones). Differences in clonal diversity among populations varied widely and ranged from maximal diversity (i.e. all ramets with different genotype) to near or total monoclonality (two populations). All multiple sampled ramets were excluded from further analysis of genetic differentiation within and between populations. All but one population were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, indicating that Zostera marina is predominantly outcrossing. From a regression of the pairwise population differentiation with distance, we obtained an effective population size N-e of 2440-5000. The overall genetic differentiation among eelgrass populations, assessed as rho (a standardized estimate of Slatkin's R-ST) was 0.384 (95% CI 0.34-0.44, P < 0.001). Genetic differentiation was weak among three North Sea populations situated 12-42 km distant from one another, suggesting that tidal currents result in an efficient exchange of propagules. In the Baltic and in Nova Scotia, a small but statistically significant fraction of the genetic variance was distributed between populations (rho = 0.029-0.053) at scales of 15-35 km. Pairwise genetic differentiation between European populations were correlated with distance between populations up to a distance of 4500 km (linear differentiation-by-distance model, R-2 = 0.67). In contrast, both Nova Scotian populations were genetically much closer to North Sea and Baltic populations than expected from their geographical distance (pairwise rho = 0.03-0.08, P < 0.01). A biogeographical cluster of Canadian with Baltic/North Sea populations was also supported using a neighbour-joining tree based on Cavalli-Sforza's chord distance. Relatedness between populations may be very different from predictions based on geographical vicinity.

#Estimates of outcrossing rates and of inbreeding depression in a population of the marine angiosperm Zostera marina.
#Ruckelshaus, MH
#1995
--------------------------------
Despite the great diversity of pollination and fertilization mechanisms observed in marine plants, little is known about the causes or maintenance of this variation. In this study, I estimated outcrossing rates and levels of inbreeding depression in Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), providing the first empirical test of hypotheses about the evolution of breeding systems in plants with submerged flowers. This study also addressed temporal separation of female and male flowering (dichogamy) in eelgrass as a mechanism promoting an outcrossing mating system, and whether the mating system in eelgrass is related to the degree of dichogamy in the held. Outcrossing rates (0 < t < 1) estimated from two polymorphic allozyme loci indicate that the Z. marina population in intertidal and subtidal habitats in False Bay, Washington, USA, was highly outcrossing in both 1991 (intertidal t = 0.905, subtidal I = 1.0) and 1992 (intertidal t = 0.775, subtidal t = 0.611). The outcrossing rates were positively associated with the degree of dichogamy in 1992; intertidal plants exhibited a greater temporal separation of female and male flowering and a higher outcrossing rate than did subtidal plants. Inbreeding depression at seed set was estimated from hand pollinations (self- and outcross) on 20 reproductive individuals from the False Bay population. Averaged across all maternal parents, a greater proportion of outcrossed flowers set seed than selfed flowers; i.e,, inbreeding depression was detected. Plants exhibited genetic variation for inbreeding depression, detected as a significant pollination treatment x maternal family interaction in a log- likelihood analysis. By the end of the seed-maturation period (7 mo after initial seed set) some families showed outbreeding depression, i.e., greater fitness in progeny derived from selfing than in progeny from outcrossing. The inbreeding depression in the False Bay population may be an important selective factor contributing to the maintenance of dichogamy and an outcrossing mating system, as proposed for aquatic plants.

#Estimation of genetic neighborhood parameters from pollen and seed dispersal in the marine angiosperm Zostera marina L..
#Ruckelshaus, MH
#1996
--------------------------------
The relative importance of random genetic drift and local adaptation in causing population substructuring in plant species remains an important empirical question. Here I estimate the effective size of the genetic neighborhood, N-b, as a means of evaluating the likely role of genetic drift in creating genetic differentiation within a population of a marine plant, Zostera marina L. (eelgrass). Calculations of effective neighborhood size are based on field estimates of pollen and seed-dispersal distributions, an electrophoretic estimate of the mating system using open-pollinated progeny arrays, and determination of the effective density of reproductive individuals in the population. Neighborhood area calculated from the parent-offspring dispersal variances was equal to N-a = 524 m(2); variance in the seed-dispersal distribution contributes more than twice as much as variance in pollen dispersal to N-a. Including an outcrossing rate slightly different from random, estimated neighborhood size for Z. marina is N-b = 6255. This estimate is one of the largest reported for plants or animals and indicates that genetic drift in small neighborhoods is highly unlikely to cause genetic substructuring in the study population. High gene-flow levels provided by the marine environment appear to prevent genetic isolation by distance among eelgrass patches, but the importance of drift through founder events in this population characterized by high patch turnover cannot be discounted and is the subject of ongoing study.

#Spatial scale of genetic structure and an indirect estimate of gene flow in eelgrass, Zostera marina.
#Ruckelshaus, MH
#1998
--------------------------------
In this study, the first investigation of population structure in an aquatic angiosperm, I show that populations of a marine angiosperm (eelgrass, Zostera marina) are genetically differentiated at a number of spatial scales. I find also that there is no correspondence between geographic and genetic distances separating subpopulations, an increasingly common result in spatially stratified studies of genetic structure in marine invertebrates. F-statistics, calculated for two years from electrophoretic variation at five polymorphic allozyme loci, indicate significant genetic differentiation among sampling quadrats within each of two bays (theta = 0.064- 0.208), between tide zones within a bay (theta 0.025-0.157) and between bays (theta = 0.079). Spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to explore genetic differentiation at smaller spatial scales; estimated patch sizes (within which genetic individuals are randomly associated) indicated no appeciable genetic structure at scales less than 20 m x 20 m. Calculated values of F-statistics were a function of the spatial scale from which samples were drawn: increasing the size of the "subpopulation" included in calculation of fixation indices for the same "total" sample resulted in an increase in the magnitude of f (e.g., from 0.092 to 0.181) and a decrease in theta (e.g., from 0.186 to 0.025). On the basis of the best estimate of the spatial scale of subpopulations, the effective number of migrants per generation (N(e)m) ranges from 1.1 to 2.8. Genetic consequences of the disturbance regime in the eelgrass habitat sampled were extreme variation between years in the allele richness and proportion of heterozygotes in a sample and a positive relationship between the extinction probability of patches and the genetic variance among them. The changes in F- statistics as a function of sampling scale and the observation that theta among sampled quadrats was positively associated with the probability of extinction among quadrats indicated that indirect estimates of gene Bow (N(e)m) calculated from theta should be cautiously interpreted in populations that may not yet be in drift-migration equilibrium.

#Reduced genetic diversity in eelgrass transplantations affects both population growth and individual fitness.
#Williams, SL
#2001
--------------------------------
The transplantation of eelgrass (Zostera marina) for mitigation results in reduced genetic diversity among individuals and populations in southern California, the Chesapeake Bay, and New Hampshire. Although genetic variation determines the potential for eelgrass to adapt to the rapidly changing environment in its coastal and estuarine habitats, genetic considerations are not currently included in mitigation and restoration policy.  investigated where and how genetic diversity is lost during eelgrass transplantation. I then explored associations between genetic diversity and both vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction to evaluate the importance of genetic diversity for short-term population growth. Eelgrass beds used as donor populations vary in genetic diversity, and some have little or no detectable genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is reduced upon transplantation because donor plants are collected from small areas, leading to random sampling errors in selecting stock. This loss can be minimized by using information from regional surveys of genetic diversity and structure in potential donor populations and by revising donor stock collection. There were significant positive associations between genetic diversity and the sexual reproduction of eelgrass, with a similar trend for vegetative propagation. Individuals heterozygous for glucose- phosphate isomerase (GPI) developed flowering shoots more than did homozygotes. More seeds germinated from a genetically diverse, untransplanted population than from a transplanted population with low genetic diversity. A field transplantation of known multilocus genotypes revealed that leaf shoot density in high-diversity eelgrass increased almost twice as fast as in low-diversity eelgrass over 22 mo. In a mesocosm experiment under heat stress. eelgrass heterozygous for either GPI or malate dehydrogenase (MDH) produced almost twice as many leaf shoots as homozygotes. The difference between treatments in all experiments increased over time. Together, these results imply that there could be economic incentives to planting genetically diverse eelgrass, and that genetic diversity contributes to eelgrass population viability even over the short term.

#Population genetic analyses of transplanted eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds reveal reduced genetic diversity in southern California.
#Williams, SL, Davis, CA
#1996
--------------------------------
Seagrass ecosystems fulfill ecologically and economically valuable functions in coastal marine environments. Unfortunately, seagrass beds are susceptible to natural and human disturbances, and their distribution is declining worldwide. Although intentional disturbance of seagrass beds must be mitigated pursuant to U.S. law, to date mitigation of seagrass beds has not prevented net loss of habitat. Transplantation of vegetative material from small areas of nearby beds is the primary method of seagrass mitigation. Restoration research on seagrasses has focused primarily on establishment of the plants and secondarily on the functional equivalency of the habitats. We questioned whether transplanted seagrass beds were comparable to ''natural'' beds in terms of genetic diversity and structure. We sampled Zostera marina L. (eelgrass) from 12 sites in the highly urbanized area of San Diego County and from pristine sites in Baja California. Using allozyme electrophoresis, we determined that genetic diversity (percentage of polymorphic loci, allele richness, expected and observed heterozygosities, and proportion of genetically unique individuals) was significantly reduced in transplanted eelgrass beds. Eelgrass from Baja California exhibited the highest genetic diversity. Based on Wright's F statistics, most of the genetic variation was distributed within rather than among sites (F-ST = 0.139), and the degree of genetic structure was only moderate at the greatest geographical scale (San Diego- Baja). Using a spatial statistical analysis (second-order analysis), we found virtually no evidence for nonrandom distribution of alleles or genotypes at scales of 3-50 m within beds. We discuss several hypotheses for reduced genetic diversity in transplanted eelgrass beds, including transplantation protocol, small size of transplantations, and reduced or failed sexual reproduction.

#Genetic diversity and structure of natural and transplanted eelgrass populations in the Chesapeake and Chincoteague bays.
#Williams, SL, Orth, RJ
#1998
--------------------------------
The objective of this study was to gain baseline population data on the genetic diversity and differentiation of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) populations in the Chesapeake and Chincoteague bays. Natural and transplanted eelgrass beds were compared using starch gel electrophoresis of allozymes. Transplanted eelgrass beds were not reduced in genetic diversity compared with natural beds. Inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) indicated that transplanted eelgrass beds had theoretically higher levels of outcrossing than natural beds, suggesting the significance of use of seeds as donor material and of seedling recruitment following transplantation diebacks. Natural populations exhibited very great genetic structure (F- ST = 0.335), but transplanted beds were genetically similar to the donor bed and each other. Genetic diversity was loir est in Chincoteague Bay, reflecting recent restoration history since the 1930s wasting disease and geographical isolation from other east coast populations. These data provide a basis for developing a management plan for conserving eelgrass genetic diversity in the Chesapeake Bay and for guiding estuary-wide restoration efforts. It will be important to recognize that the natural genetic diversity of eelgrass in the estuary is distributed among various populations and is not web represented by single populations.

#Population genetics of hydrophilous angiosperms.
#Laushman, RH
#1993
--------------------------------
Comparisons between genetic variation and life history and ecological characteristics have been produced for over 400 plant species since the advent of starch gel electrophoresis. Knowledge of how aquatic life histories relate to population genetic structure is lacking, however. Four hydrophilous species - Zostera marina L., Vallisneria americana Michx., Ceratophyllum demersum L., and Ceratophyllum echinatum Gray - have been studied using allozyme estimates of variation within and among populations. At the species level, the percent of polymorphic loci is equal to, or higher than, the average reported for all plant species. At the population level, however, hydrophilous taxa have lower percent of polymorphic loci, fewer alleles per locus, and lower levels of heterozygosity than non-hydrophiles. Except for Z. marina, hydrophilous species show much greater partitioning of variation among populations than non-hydrophiles, particularly when compared with anemophilous species. Explanations for these patterns include limited sexuality (Ceratophyllum), extensive clonal spread (all four species), and the greater isolation of freshwater populations (lakes as islands) relative to most terrestrial species and to coastal species such as Z. marina.

#Floral neighbourhoods in the sea: how floral density, opportunity for outcrossing and population fragmentation affect seed set in Zostera marina.
#Reusch, TBH
#2003
--------------------------------
1 Almost nothing is known about how the floral neighbourhood affects reproductive output in plants with subaqueous pollination (hydrophily), such as seagrasses, an ecologically important group of some 60 marine angiosperms. 2 I studied how floral density, genetic diversity and population fragmentation affect seed set in Zostera marina (eelgrass), a functionally hermaphrodite seagrass with extensive clonal propagation. 3 In a field experiment in the south-western Baltic Sea, I increased or decreased the density of flowering shoots in 6 x 6 m plots. Early seed set was a positive, saturation-type function of density suggesting pollen limitation below approximately 5 flowering shoots m(-2) . 4 Using molecular markers, I determined local genotypic diversity and outcrossing rates as indicators of outcrossing opportunities. I found only non-significant effects of these variables on early seed set, suggesting that density of the floral neighbourhood is more important than genetic composition. 5 Early seed set was 22% lower in isolated vegetation patches compared to continuous eelgrass meadow (> 50 m(2) ). 6 Given the spatial scale of the observed pollen limitation, and low natural densities of flowering shoots in the field, pollen limitation may be widespread in Z. marina and, possibly, other plant species with subaqueous pollination.

#Population genetic structure of annual and perennial populations of Zostera marina L. along the Pacific coast of Baja California and the Gulf of California
#Muniz-Salazar, R, Talbot, SL, Sage, GK, Ward, DH and Cabello-Pasini, A
#2005
--------------------------------
The Baja California peninsula represents a biogeographical boundary contributing to regional differentiation among populations of marine animals. We investigated the genetic characteristics of perennial and annual populations of the marine angiosperm, Zostera marina, along the Pacific coast of Baja California and in the Gulf of California, respectively. Populations of Z. marina from five coastal lagoons along the Pacific coast and four sites in the Gulf of California were studied using nine microsatellite loci. Analyses of variance revealed significant interregional differentiation, but no subregional differentiation. Significant spatial differentiation, assessed using theta(ST) values, was observed among all populations within the two regions. Z. marina populations along the Pacific coast are separated by more than 220 km and had the greatest theta(ST) (0.13-0.28) values, suggesting restricted gene flow. In contrast, lower but still significant genetic differentiation was observed among populations within the Gulf of California (theta(ST) = 0.04-0.18), even though populations are separated by more than 250 km. This suggests higher levels of gene flow among Gulf of California populations relative to Pacific coast populations. Direction of gene flow was predominantly southward among Pacific coast populations, whereas no dominant polarity in the Gulf of California populations was observed. The test for isolation by distance (IBD) showed a significant correlation between genetic and geographical distances in Gulf of California populations, but not in Pacific coast populations, perhaps because of shifts in currents during El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events along the Pacific coast.

#Genetic structure of eelgrass Zostera marina meadows in an embayment with restricted water flow
#Muniz-Salazar, R, Talbot, SL, Sage, GK, Ward, DH, Cabello-Pasini, A
#2006
--------------------------------
Genetic structure of the seagrass Zostera marina in a coastal lagoon with restricted water flow, and with heterogeneous water residence times and oceanographic characteristics, was assessed using 8 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Analyses of genetic differentiation (theta) and Bayesian clustering suggested that the Z. marina population in San Quintin Bay (SQB) is genetically substructured, with at least 4 genetically different groups; (1) West Head, (2) Mouth, (3) East Arm, and (4) East Head. The greatest theta value was observed between the most distant sites (theta = 0.095). The lowest values were found among sites closest to the mouth of the coastal lagoon (theta = 0.000 to 0.009). The maximum likelihood approach showed that the sites at the mouth have a mixed pattern of gene flow without a unidirectional pattern. In contrast, there was a clear pattern of asymmetrical gene flow from the mouth towards the West Head. These results suggested that the restriction of water flow at the heads, current pattern, and the distance between sites can reduce genetic flow and promote genetic differences within Z. marina meadows in small water embayments such as SQB. Though the population is genetically substructured and a 14% decline in cover has been detected, this study did not show evidence of a recent genetic bottleneck. In contrast, mouth sites have experienced a recent expansion in their population size, and also perhaps a recent influx of rare alleles from genetically distinct immigrants.

#Genetic sub-structure and intermediate optimal outcrossing distance in the marine angiosperm Zostera marina
#Billingham, MR Simoes, T Reusch, TBH Serrao, EA
#2007
--------------------------------
The spatial distribution of genetic variability depends on the spatial patterns of clonal and sexual reproduction, gene flow, genetic drift and natural selection. Species with restricted dispersal may exhibit genetic structuring within populations with immediate neighbours being close relatives, and may show differentiation among populations. Genetic structuring of a species may have important genetic, evolutionary and ecological consequences including distance-dependent mating success. In this study we used microsatellite markers to show that clones of Zostera marina in a population in the Ria Formosa, Portugal, were aggregated and covered distances of up to 3-4 m. Clones within 4 m of each other exhibited significant and positive coancestry values, reflecting the limited seed dispersal of this species. Hand-pollinations between near (0-10.9 m), intermediate (11-32 m) and far (15 km) individuals resulted in similar levels of seed set, although the near pollinations had higher, although not statistically significant, levels of seed abortion during maturation. Seeds from intermediate-distance pollinations had a significantly higher proportion of seeds germinate and shorter germination time than both the near and far seeds. Similarly, the average number of seedlings produced per pollination, used as an overall estimate of fitness, was significantly greater for the intermediate distance when compared to both near and far pollinations. These results suggest that the genetic structuring observed may result in both inbreeding and outbreeding depression, which gives rise to an intermediate optimal outcrossing distance

#Eelgrass meadows in the california channel islands and adjacent coast reveal a mosaic of two species, evidence for introgression and variable clonality
#Coyer, JA Miller, KA Engle, JM Veldsink, J Cabello-Pasini, A Stam, WT Olsen, JL
#2008
--------------------------------
Background and Aims Seagrasses are important facilitator species in shallow, soft-bottom marine environments worldwide and, in many places, are threatened by coastal development and eutrophication. One narrow-leaved species (Zostera marina) and one wide-leaved species, variously designated as Z. marina, Z. pacifica or Z. asiatica, are found off the California Channel Islands and adjacent California-Mexico coast. The aim of the present study was to confirm species identification genetically and to link patterns of genetic diversity, connectivity and hybridization among and within the populations with historical sea levels (Ice Age) or the contemporary environment. Methods Samples (n = 11-100) were collected from 28 sites off five California Channel Islands and six sites off the adjacent coast of southern California and Baja California, Mexico. DNA polymorphisms of the rDNA-ITS (internal transcribed spacer) cistron (nuclear), the matK intron (chloroplast) and nine microsatellite loci (nuclear) were examined in a population genetic and phylogeographic context. Key Results All wide-leaved individuals were Z. pacifica, whereas narrow-leaved forms were Z. marina. Microsatellite genotypes were consistent with hybridization between the two species in three populations. The present distribution of Z. pacifica follows a glacial age land mass rather than present oceanographic regimes, but no link was observed between the present distribution of Z. marina and past or present environments. Island populations of Z. marina often were clonal and characterized by low genotypic diversity compared with populations along the Baja California coast. The high level of clonal connectivity around Santa Catalina Island indicated the importance of dispersal and subsequent re-establishment of vegetative fragments. Conclusions The pristine environmental conditions of offshore islands do not guarantee maximum genetic diversity. Future restoration and transplantation efforts of seagrasses must recognize cryptic species and consider the degree of both genetic and genotypic variation in candidate donor populations.

#Ecological impacts of genotypic diversity in the clonal seagrass Zostera marina
#Hughes, AR Stachowicz, JJ
#2009
--------------------------------
Genetic diversity, like species diversity, can have important
 consequences for communities and ecosystems. However, little is known
 about whether the effects of genetic diversity demonstrated in
 experimental assemblages are of sufficient strength to generate
 patterns in natural systems. We conducted a survey of eelgrass (Zostera
 marina) to examine the correlation between eelgrass clonal diversity
 and two metrics of community structure across two seasons: shoot
 density (reflective of habitat quality) and biomass of epiphytic algae
 (as a measure of food resource availability). Eelgrass clonal diversity
 was not related to epiphyte biomass in either winter or summer.
 Interestingly, there was a positive relationship between eelgrass
 clonal diversity and shoot density only in the winter, when eelgrass
 experiences stress from abiotic and biotic factors. The magnitude of
 this correlation was similar to that of other factors known to affect
 shoot density such as tidal elevation or position in the bed. In
 contrast, summer shoot density and diversity were uncorrelated. This
 natural pattern is consistent with previous experimental results in
 which diversity positively affected shoot density only during periods
 of abiotic or biotic stress, suggesting that the effects of clonal
 diversity are sufficiently strong to influence shoot density in the
 field, despite the presence of potentially confounding environmental
 gradients.

#Population Structure of Zostera marina (Eelgrass) on the Western Atlantic Coast Is Characterized by Poor Connectivity and Inbreeding
#Campanella JJ, Bologna PA, Smalley JV, Rosenzweig EB, Smith SM
#2010
--------------------------------
Zostera marina (eelgrass) can be found in the North Atlantic on the coast of Europe and on the east and west coasts of North America. Over the last 30 years, this once robust species has been reduced to sparse patchy populations due to disease and anthropogenic effects. In order to better understand the consequences of this devastation on the population genetics of the species, we have analyzed the population structure of western Atlantic Z. marina, employing microsatellite DNA polymorphisms. Although high fixation index values suggest moderate genetic differentiation among most of the Z. marina sites, population diversity was low. This lack of diversity was supported by a general dearth of observable heterozygotes in these sites; mean observed heterozygosity values (0.14-0.46) were lower than the mean expected heterozygosity values (0.57-0.81). Additionally, the mean FIS (coefficient of local inbreeding) values in these sites were positive, again indicating a surfeit of homozygotes. Allelic richness suggests that Chesapeake Bay has the greatest internal genetic diversity of the sites studied. Inbreeding seems prevalent in these American populations, suggesting possible reproductive fitness problems in the future. There is evidence of demographic bottlenecking and particularly low genetic diversity in Long Island. Northern Maine had the highest effective population size, suggesting a possible use in future restoration projects.

#Zostera marina population genetics in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, and implications for grass bed restoration
#Campanella JJ, Bologna PAX, Smith SM, Rosenzweig EB, Smalley JV
#2010
--------------------------------
Within Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, Zostera marina populations have declined by 62% over the last 20 years, and restoration efforts have met with mixed success. We have completed a microsatellite-based genetic investigation of eight populations of Z. marina within Barnegat Bay to determine whether the genetic stock origins of the plants used in management projects may affect restoration success. Additionally, we assessed the genetic diversity of Z. marina in Barnegat Bay to better understand its population structure. Clonal diversity ranged from 0.70 to 0.95 for the populations studied. Individually, Barnegat Bay populations are not genetically diverse, and there is also little divergence among populations. The Atlantic populations had mean Hobs values (0.20-0.34) that were far lower than the Hexp values (0.69-0.83). Also, the F (IS) values in all of the eastern populations indicate a surfeit of homozygotes over heterozygotes, suggesting a low degree of outcrossing in the Barnegat Bay populations. Six of the ten populations studied (Ham Island, Manahawkin Bay, Shelter Island, Marsh Elder, Harvey Cedar Sedge, and Long Island) show evidence of historical bottlenecks. Mean estimated F (ST) values would suggest that most alleles are undergoing moderate genetic differentiation, with values that range from 0.06 to 0.13. Oyster Creek and Sedge Island demonstrate the largest estimated effective population sizes and may be the most appropriate populations for use in future eelgrass restoration projects.

#New evidence for habitat-specific selection in Wadden Sea Zostera marina populations revealed by genome scanning using SNP and microsatellite markers
#Oetjen K, Ferber S, Dankert I, Reusch TBH
#2010
--------------------------------
Eelgrass Zostera marina is an ecosystem-engineering species of outstanding importance for coastal soft sediment habitats that lives in widely diverging habitats. Our first goal was to detect divergent selection and habitat adaptation at the molecular genetic level; hence, we compared three pairs of permanently submerged versus intertidal populations using genome scans, a genetic marker-based approach. Three different statistical approaches for outlier identification revealed divergent selection at 6 loci among 46 markers (6 SNPs, 29 EST microsatellites and 11 anonymous microsatellites). These outlier loci were repeatedly detected in parallel habitat comparisons, suggesting the influence of habitat-specific selection. A second goal was to test the consistency of the general genome scan approach by doubling the number of gene-linked microsatellites and adding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, a novel marker type for seagrasses, compared to a previous study. Reassuringly, results with respect to selection were consistent among most marker loci. Functionally interesting marker loci were linked to genes involved in osmoregulation and water balance, suggesting different osmotic stress, and reproductive processes (seed maturation), pointing to different life history strategies. The identified outlier loci are valuable candidates for further investigation into the genetic basis of natural selection.

#Genetic Structure and Diversity of Zostera marina (Eelgrass) in the San Juan Archipelago, Washington, USA
#Wyllie-Echeverria S, Talbot SL, Rearick JR
#2010
--------------------------------
Using data from eight autosomal microsatellite loci, we investigated levels of within- and between-site variation in the seagrass Zostera marina L. (eelgrass) from eight locations in the San Juan Archipelago, located in the northwest corner of Washington, USA. Only 117 of the 365 samples collected were unique individuals, and there were large differences in the estimates of clonality among sites. Site-specific genotypic richness ranged from 0.082 to 0.688, and the distribution of ramets and genets varied widely within sites. No multilocus genotypes were shared between sites. We found significant differences in distribution of alleles and variance in allele frequencies among sites, suggesting substantial genetic population substructuring. We detected low levels of genetic diversity in two sites known to have undergone recent declines and a genetic signature of population expansion in a site known to be increasing. Thus, like elsewhere, we find that genetic studies add an important component to monitoring programs in this region.

#Transcriptomic resilience to global warming in the seagrass Zostera marina, a marine foundation species
#Franssen SU, Gu J, Bergmann N, Winters G, Klostermeier UC, Rosenstiel P, Bornberg-Bauer E, Reusch TBH
#2011
--------------------------------
Large-scale transcription profiling via direct cDNA sequencing provides important insights as to how foundation species cope with increasing climatic extremes predicted under global warming. Species distributed along a thermal cline, such as the ecologically important seagrass Zostera marina, provide an opportunity to assess temperature effects on gene expression as a function of their long-term adaptation to heat stress. We exposed a southern and northern European population of Zostera marina from contrasting thermal environments to a realistic heat wave in a common-stress garden. In a fully crossed experiment, eight cDNA libraries, each comprising similar to 125 000 reads, were obtained during and after a simulated heat wave, along with nonstressed control treatments. Although gene-expression patterns during stress were similar in both populations and were dominated by classical heat-shock proteins, transcription profiles diverged after the heat wave. Gene-expression patterns in southern genotypes returned to control values immediately, but genotypes from the northern site failed to recover and revealed the induction of genes involved in protein degradation, indicating failed metabolic compensation to high sea-surface temperature. We conclude that the return of gene-expression patterns during recovery provides critical information on thermal adaptation in aquatic habitats under climatic stress. As a unifying concept for ecological genomics, we propose transcriptomic resilience, analogous to ecological resilience, as an important measure to predict the tolerance of individuals and hence the fate of local populations in the face of global warming.

#Seagrass genotypic diversity increases disturbance response via complementarity and dominance
#Hughes AR, Stachowicz JJ
#2011
--------------------------------
1. Genetic diversity, like species diversity, can enhance resistance or resilience to perturbation. However, we know little about how disturbance intensity affects this relationship or what mechanisms underlie the positive effects of genetic diversity. 2. We experimentally tested the independent and interactive effects of seagrass genotypic diversity (two levels) and disturbance (three levels) on seagrass biomass in a 2-year field experiment. 3. Our results indicate that genotypic diversity enhances seagrass resilience from experimental biomass removal, but only at the highest level of disturbance; in the absence of disturbance, monocultures out-perform polycultures over the short term. 4. Following recovery from the planned experimental disturbance, a natural macroalgal bloom caused a loss of seagrass shoots in our plots. In this case polycultures lost fewer shoots than monocultures (i.e. were more resistant to the disturbance), and this positive effect of genetic diversity persisted until the end of the experiment (1 year in total, including 6 months after all plots had recovered to pre-disturbance densities). At the end of the 2-year experiment, polycultures had higher shoot density and above-ground biomass than monocultures. 5. The positive effects of diversity on shoot density and biomass were caused by both trait-independent complementarity (TIC; due to differential resource use among clones) and positive dominance (due to one genotype achieving high density in both monoculture and polyculture). 6. Synthesis. Our results confirm that genetic diversity, like species diversity, can influence disturbance response and does so via similar mechanisms. They also highlight that over longer time frames, these effects are likely to result from a complex mix of dominance and complementarity mechanisms that depend on the traits of the specific taxa involved and the response variables of interest.

#Genetic structure and gene flow of eelgrass Zostera marina populations in Tokyo Bay, Japan: implications for their restoration
#Tanaka N, Demise T, Ishii M, Shoji Y, Nakaoka M
#2011
--------------------------------
Massive losses of eelgrass Zostera marina beds in Japan have occurred over the past 100 years. Toward their restoration, transplantation of eelgrass has been attempted in some areas, including Tokyo Bay. This study examined population genetic structures and gene flow in eelgrass in Tokyo Bay to establish guidelines for conducting restoration. Genotypes of a total of 360 individuals from 12 beds were determined using five microsatellite markers. The eelgrass beds in inner bay had above-average genetic diversity. A neighbor-joining tree based on F(ST) values among beds revealed that a strong gene flow had occurred among six beds in the inner bay. Genetic assignment testing of drifting shoots indicated that those with seeds migrate in both directions between the inner and outer bay. We suggested that the restoration of eelgrass in the innermost part of Tokyo Bay, where natural habitats have been lost, should be conducted using the inner bay beds.

#Population genetics of Zostera marina Linnaeus (Zosteraceae) based on AFLP analysis
#Li, Y., N. Song, W.-T. Li, and T.-X. Gao
#2012
--------------------------------
The genetic relationship of Zostera marina was analyzed by AFLP marker. A total of 235 bands were detected from 63 individuals by 6 primer combinations, of which. 160(68.09%) loci were polymorphic. The highest Nei's gene diversity value (H) and Shannon's information index value (I) were detected in population Clare (H = 0.072, I = 0.115), while the lowest were observed in population Jiaonan (H = 0.007, I = 0.011). Genetic identify values among 6 populations ranging from 0.66 to 0.92 were observed with the corresponding distance values ranging from 0.076 to 0.340. The results of AMOVA showed 83.29% genetic variation was found among populations and 16.71% within populations. According to UPGMA tree, population Tian'ehu was genetically closer to population Jiaonan than population Lidao, which might be attributable to eelgrass meadow fragments and some marine gyres/currents. The geographic distances were responsible for the genetic differentiation among populations from China, Japan, Korea and Ireland. The results of the present study emphasized the utility of DNA-based markers for conservation in genetically depauperate species, any future restoration and conservation projects locally used eco-sourced materials for population augmentations.

#Isolation and characterization of microsatellite markers for Zostera marina and their cross-species amplification in Zostera caespitosa
#Peng, J., L. Zhang, X. Jiang, C. Cui, R. Wu, and J. Zhao
#2012
--------------------------------
Zostera marina is the most wide-ranging marine flowering plant in Northern Hemisphere. It helps to physically form the habitat and provides food for a variety of marine organisms. Nineteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed and characterized in 45 individuals from Shandong Peninsula (Northwest Pacific). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 6. The observed and expected heterozygosity per locus ranged from 0.11 to 0.83 and from 0.11 to 0.74, respectively. Two loci were deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and in linkage disequilibrium, respectively. Only one locus (Pzm75) showed evidence for null alleles. Twelve loci were cross-species amplification in a vulnerable seagrass species Zostera caespitosa.

#Population Structure and Genetic Diversity among Eelgrass (Zostera marina) Beds and Depths in San Francisco Bay
#Ort, B. S., C. S. Cohen, K. E. Boyer, and S. Wyllie-Echeverria
#2012
--------------------------------
The seagrass Zostera marina is widely distributed in coastal regions throughout much of the northern hemisphere, forms the foundation of an important ecological habitat, and is suffering population declines. Studies in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans indicate that the degree of population genetic differentiation is location dependent. San Francisco Bay, California, USA, is a high-current, high-wind environment where rafting of seed-bearing shoots has the potential to enhance genetic connectivity among Z. marina populations. We tested Z. marina from six locations, including one annual population, within the bay to assess population differentiation and to compare levels of within-population genetic diversity. Using 7 microsatellite loci, we found significant differentiation among all populations. The annual population had significantly higher clonal diversity than the others but showed no detectible differences in heterozygosity or allelic richness. There appears to be sufficient input of genetic variation through sexual reproduction or immigration into the perennial populations to prevent significant declines in the number and frequency of alleles. In additional depth comparisons, we found differentiation among deep and shallow portions in 1 of 3 beds evaluated. Genetic drift, sweepstakes recruitment, dispersal limitation, and possibly natural selection may have combined to produce genetic differentiation over a spatial scale of 3-30 km in Z. marina. This implies that the scale of genetic differentiation may be smaller than expected for seagrasses in other locations too. We suggest that populations in close proximity may not be interchangeable for use as restoration material.

#Fine-scale genetic structure and relatedness in the eelgrass Zostera marina
#Kamel, S. J., A. R. Hughes, R. K. Grosberg, and J. J. Stachowicz
#2012
--------------------------------
The genetic composition of groups of individuals can significantly influence the productivity, resilience, and functioning of communities and ecosystems. For example, the re latedness of individuals within a group often dictates whether their interactions are competitive or cooperative. It is therefore necessary to characterize the genetic structure of populations at spatial scales relevant to these interactions and to determine the distribution of genetic diversity at those scales. Using microsatellite data, we assessed fine-scale population structure of Zostera marina, an important habitat-forming seagrass, within and between Bodega Harbor and Tomales Bay in northern California, USA. Despite the potential for long-range dispersal, we found significant population structure at all hierarchical scales (among bays, among sites, among tidal heights), corresponding to distances ranging from meters to tens of kilometers. The pattern of genetic differentiation that emerged at local scales differed between bays, with Tomales Bay being more structured even though the Euclidean distances among sites were similar in each bay. The relatedness of genets within a tidal height also differed among bays: in Bodega Harbor most genets occurred in proximity to unrelated individuals, whereas in Tomales Bay, genets were mixed with their close relatives, likely due to decreased dispersal. These contrasting kin structures, coupled with highly variable levels of clonal diversity, underscore the importance of examining variation at multiple scales, as this reveals genetic factors which might play an important role in many ecological processes.

#Eelgrass restoration by seed maintains genetic diversity: case study from a coastal bay system
#Reynolds, L. K., M. Waycott, K. J. McGlathery, R. J. Orth, and J. C. Zieman
#2012
--------------------------------
Genetic diversity is positively associated with plant fitness, stability, and the provision of ecosystem services. Preserving genetic diversity is therefore considered an important component of ecosystem restoration as well as a measure of its success. We examined the genetic diversity of restored Zostera marina meadows in a coastal bay system along the USA mid-Atlantic coast using microsatellite markers to compare donor and recipient meadows. We show that donor meadows in Chesapeake Bay have high genetic diversity and that this diversity is maintained in meadows restored with seeds in the Virginia coastal bays. No evidence of inbreeding depression was detected (F-IS-0.2 to 0) in either donor or recipient meadows, which is surprising because high levels of inbreeding were expected following the population contractions that occurred in Chesapeake Bay populations due to disease and heat stress. Additionally, there was no evidence for selection of genotypes at the restoration sites, suggesting that as long as donor sites are chosen carefully, issues that diminish fitness and survival such as heterosis or out-breeding depression can be avoided. A cluster analysis showed that, in addition to the Chesapeake Bay populations that acted as donors, the Virginia coastal bay populations shared a genetic signal with Chincoteague Bay populations, their closest neighbor to the north, suggesting that natural recruitment into the area may be occurring and augmenting restored populations. We hypothesize that the high genetic diversity in seagrasses restored using seeds rather than adult plants confers a greater level of ecosystem resilience to the restored meadows.

#Range-edge genetic diversity: locally poor extant southern patches maintain a regionally diverse hotspot in the seagrass Zostera marina
#Diekmann, O. E., and E. A. Serrao
#2012
--------------------------------
Refugial populations at the rear edge are predicted to contain higher genetic diversity than those resulting from expansion, such as in post-glacial recolonizations. However, peripheral populations are also predicted to have decreased diversity compared to the centre of a species distribution. We aim to test these predictions by comparing genetic diversity in populations at the limits of distribution of the seagrass Zostera marina, with populations in the species previously described central diversity hotspot. Zostera marina populations show decreased allelic richness, heterozygosity and genotypic richness in both the rear edge and the leading edge compared to the diversity hotspot in the North Sea/Baltic region. However, when populations are pooled, genetic diversity at the southern range is as high as in the North Sea/Baltic region while the leading edge remains low in genetic diversity. The decreased genetic diversity in these southern Iberian populations compared to more central populations is possibly the effect of drift because of small effective population size, as a result of reduced habitat, low sexual reproduction and low gene flow. However, when considering the whole southern edge of distribution rather than per population, diversity is as high as in the central hotspot in the North Sea/Baltic region. We conclude that diversity patterns assessed per population can mask the real regional richness that is typical of rear edge populations, which have played a key role in the species biogeographical history and as marginal diversity hotspots have very high conservation value.

#Shimabukuro, H., M. Hori, S. Yoshimitsu, N. Tokunaga, T. Igari, K. Sasaki, M. Nakaoka, M. Kawane, G. Yoshida, and M. Hamaguchi
#2012
--------------------------------
The Zostera marina bed is an important habitat for the biological productivity and diversity of coastal marine organisms including various important fishery species. Seed dispersal is a definitive factor to that regulates the annual Z. marina production and is inportant for maintaining the annual Z. marina beds. This study examined the seed dispersal dynamics of the annual Z. marina based on a molecular analysis using 7 microsatellite markers and measuring the morphological characteristics of thallus in Kagoshima Bay, Japan. Samples for DNA analysis and morphological measurement were collected from five local populations at 10 sites where annual Z. marina was found to be growing. Morphological characteristics of the Z. marina samples differed among local populations with different environmental conditions. Moreover, pairwise Fst values of microsatellite locus calculated from the five populations ranged from 0.112 to 0.415 (mean = 0.273), suggesting that the genetic differentiation among local populations was markedly large. The results of this study indicated that the seed dispersal of annual Z. marina among local populations has rarely occurred for a long time.

#An analysis of the population genetics of restored Zostera marina plantings in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey
#Campanella, James J., Bologna, Paul A. X., Smalley, John V., Avila, Diana N., Lee, Karen N., Areche, Eduardo C., Slavin, Laura J.
#2013
--------------------------------
Within Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, eelgrass (Zostera marina) populations have declined by 62 % over the last 20 years. To better understand the consequences of this devastation, we have previously employed microsatellite DNA polymorphisms to analyze the population structure of Z. marina within Barnegat Bay, as well as along the eastern United States seaboard. We have restored populations of Z. marina in Barnegat Bay over the last 10 years to help assess the best planting conditions and ecotypes that might be used in long-term restoration strategies. In this study, we examined the genetic health of the restored populations compared to that of the donor eelgrass populations within the bay. Using microsatellites, we can identify which parental founding ecotypes survived the restoration process over multiple generations. The frequency of observed heterozygotes, although higher than in the natural populations, still indicates reduced levels of diversity and connectivity. The inbreeding frequency is high in the restored populations, but lower than what is seen in the native populations. All restored populations have effective population values > 50, suggesting a high probability of survival in the short term.

#Distinguishing morphologically similar Zostera species (Z. caespitosa and Z. marina) using microsatellite DNA markers on leaf fragments
#Jiang, Xin, Peng, Jie, Zhang, Linan, Cui, Cuiju, Tian, Pingping, Li, Xiaojie, Zhang, Xiumei, Gao, Tianxiang
#2013
--------------------------------
In this study, 26 published microsatellite DNA markers, which were originally developed for Zostera marina, were employed to distinguish between 57 Z. marina and 49 Zostera caespitosa samples collected from different submerged meadows on the coasts of Northeastern China. Eight of these markers were suitable for cross-species analysis. On the basis of the data obtained from these loci, all of the Z. marina and Z. caespitosa samples were correctly assigned to the cluster of their species in the assignment test. Using PCR amplification, 4 of the 26 markers were positive for Z marina and negative for Z. caespitosa. We found that both the assignment test with 8 loci and PCR with 4 loci were efficient in distinguishing between the two sympatric species, which was previously only achieved by scientific divers.

#Genetic diversity and gene flow in Zostera marina populations surrounding Long Island, New York, USA: No evidence of inbreeding, genetic degradation or population isolation
#Peterson, Bradley J., Bricker, Eric, Brisbin, Sterling J., Furman, Bradley T., Stubler, Amber D., Carroll, John M., Berry, Dianna L., Gobler, Christopher J., Calladine, Ainsley, Waycott, Michelle
#2013
--------------------------------
Since the 1930s, eelgrass around Long Island, New York, USA, has experienced significant ecological and anthropogenic disturbances reducing areal coverage of the species. Patchiness, low density or isolation of these remaining populations increase susceptibility of this aquatic angiosperm to extinction. The loss of genetic diversity and patch connectivity, may contribute to lower fitness of eelgrass thus affecting recovery potential. Previous studies of eelgrass populations around Long Island report genetically isolated populations with low diversity. In contrast, this study found neither the evidence of inbreeding nor indications of genetic degradation for the same populations. Measures of genetic diversity such as average alleles (A= 7.59) and fixation index (F= 0.02) suggest no significant impediments to genetic connectivity among populations sampled. Gene flow (Nn, = 4.58) and bottleneck analyses suggest the major disturbances of the past have not strongly affected population structure in the Long Island system. These findings have significant implications for both management and restoration. Locally, eelgrass populations in Long Island waters are unlikely to decline through genetic erosion or inbreeding processes alone. Plants from within these populations possess adequate genetic diversity to undertake restoration activities. On a larger geographic scale, the ability of these plants to maintain such high levels of genetic diversity and connectivity despite the significant areal losses historically provides optimism for the recovery potential of this species despite recent global losses.

#Restoration recovers population structure and landscape genetic connectivity in a dispersal-limited ecosystem
#Reynolds, Laura K., Waycott, Michelle, McGlathery, Karen J.
#2013
--------------------------------
1. Ecological restoration assists the recovery of degraded ecosystems; however, restoration can have deleterious effects such as outbreeding depression when source material is not chosen carefully and has non-local adaptations. 2. We surveyed 23 eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) populations along the North American Atlantic coast to evaluate genetic structure and connectivity among restored and naturally recruited populations. 3. While populations along the North America Atlantic coast were genetically distinctive, significant migration was detected among populations. All estimates of connectivity (F-ST, migration rate base on rare alleles, and Bayesian modelling) showed a general north to south pattern of migration, corresponding to the typical long-shore currents in this region. 4. Individual naturally recruited meadows in the Virginia coastal bays appear to be the result of dispersal from different meadows north of the region. This supports the hypothesis that recruitment into this region is typically a slow, episodic process rather than a permanent, continuous connection between the populations. 5. While natural recovery of populations that were catastrophically lost in the 1930s has been slow, large-scale seed-based restoration has been very successful at quickly restoring landscape-scale areal coverage (over 1600ha in just 10years). Our results show that restoration was also successful at restoring meadows with high genetic diversity. Naturally recruited meadows were less diverse and exhibited signs of genetic drift. 6. Synthesis. Our analyses demonstrate that metapopulation dynamics are important to the natural recovery of seagrass ecosystems that have experienced catastrophic loss over large spatial scales; however, natural recovery processes are slow and inefficient at recovering genetic diversity and population structure when recruitment barriers exist, such as a limited seed source. Seed-based restoration provides a greater abundance of propagules, rapidly facilitates the recovery of populations with higher genetic diversity, and when seed sources are chosen carefully protects regional genetic structure. First-order estimates indicated that the genetic diversity achieved by active restoration in 10years would have otherwise taken between 125 and 185years to achieve through natural recruitment events.

#Population specific salinity tolerance in eelgrass (Zostera marina)
#Salo, Tiina, Pedersen, Morten Foldager, Bostrom, Christoffer
#2014
--------------------------------
Salinity is one of the main factors impacting distribution of marine plants and sub-optimal salinities may result in increased resource use and decreased production. We studied the performance and salinity tolerance of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) originating from two regions with different ambient salinities: a low saline (salinity 6) and a high saline (salinity 20) population. Plants from both populations were exposed to a series of fixed salinities (2, 4, 6, 9, 12.5, 15, 20 and 25) for 5 weeks. Both plant origin and salinity affected plant performance significantly. Plant production decreased with decreasing salinity in both populations, while mortality increased in low salinity only in plants originating from the high saline population. The better performance of the low saline population in the lowest salinities indicates a horizontal shift in salinity tolerance among populations with different origin and that the low saline population is better adapted to hyposaline conditions. Despite the long-term adaptation of the low saline population to stable, low salinity, these plants were still able to function normally in high salinities, indicating remarkable plasticity. The results further suggest that altered salinity can severely impact seagrass productivity but responses might vary significantly depending on plant origin. Such variability in stress tolerance indicates that some populations have better chances to survive in and adapt to future changes in environment.

#Genetic diversity of seagrass seeds influences seedling morphology and biomass
#Hughes, AR, Hanley, TC, Schenck, FR, Hays, CG
#2016
--------------------------------
Genetic diversity can influence ecological processes throughout ontogeny, yet whether diversity at early life history stages is important in long-lived taxa with overlapping generations is unclear. Seagrass systems provide some of the best evidence for the ecological effects of genetic diversity among adult shoots, but we do not know if the genetic diversity of seeds and seedlings also influences seagrass ecology. We tested the effects of seagrass (Zostera marina) seed diversity and relatedness on germination success, seedling morphology, and seedling production by comparing experimental assemblages of seeds collected from single reproductive shoots (monocultures) to assemblages of seeds collected from multiple reproductive shoots (polycultures). There was no difference in seedling emergence, yet seedlings from polycultures had larger shoots above and below ground than seedlings from monocultures at the end of the 1-yr experiment. Genetic relatedness of the seedlings predicted some aspects of shoot morphology, with more leaves and longer roots and shoots at intermediate levels of relatedness, regardless of seed diversity. Our results suggest that studies of only adult stages may underestimate the importance of genetic diversity if the benefits at early life history stages continue to accrue throughout the life cycle.

#Phylogeographic differentiation versus transcriptomic adaptation to warm temperatures in Zostera marina, a globally important seagrass
#Jueterbock, A, Franssen, SU, Bergmann, N, Gu, J, Coyer, JA, Reusch, TBH, Bornberg-Bauer, E, Olsen, JL
#2016
--------------------------------
Populations distributed across a broad thermal cline are instrumental in addressing adaptation to increasing temperatures under global warming. Using a space-for-time substitution design, we tested for parallel adaptation to warm temperatures along two independent thermal clines in Zostera marina, the most widely distributed seagrass in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. A North-South pair of populations was sampled along the European and North American coasts and exposed to a simulated heatwave in a common-garden mesocosm. Transcriptomic responses under control, heat stress and recovery were recorded in 99 RNAseq libraries with similar to 13 000 uniquely annotated, expressed genes. We corrected for phylogenetic differentiation among populations to discriminate neutral from adaptive differentiation. The two southern populations recovered faster from heat stress and showed parallel transcriptomic differentiation, as compared with northern populations. Among 2389 differentially expressed genes, 21 exceeded neutral expectations and were likely involved in parallel adaptation to warm temperatures. However, the strongest differentiation following phylogenetic correction was between the three Atlantic populations and the Mediterranean population with 128 of 4711 differentially expressed genes exceeding neutral expectations. Although adaptation to warm temperatures is expected to reduce sensitivity to heatwaves, the continued resistance of seagrass to further anthropogenic stresses may be impaired by heat-induced downregulation of genes related to photosynthesis, pathogen defence and stress tolerance.

#Population genetic structure of eelgrass (Zostera marina) on the Korean coast: Current status and conservation implications for future management
#Kim, JH, Kang, JH, Jang, JE, Choi, SK, Kim, MJ, Park, SR, Lee, HJ
#2017
--------------------------------
Seagrasses provide numerous ecosystem services for coastal and estuarine environments, such as nursery functions, erosion protection, pollution filtration, and carbon sequestration. Zostera marina (common name broken vertical bar eelgrass ) is one of the seagrass bed-forming species distributed widely in the northern hemisphere, including the Korean Peninsula. Recently, however, there has been a drastic decline in the population size of Z. marina worldwide, including Korea. We examined the current population genetic status of this species on the southern coast of Korea by estimating the levels of genetic diversity and genetic structure of 10 geographic populations using eight nuclear microsatellite markers. The level of genetic diversity was found to be significantly lower for populations on Jeju Island [mean allelic richness (AR) = 1.92, clonal diversity (R) = 0.51], which is located approximately 155 km off the southernmost region of the Korean Peninsula, than for those in the South Sea (mean AR = 2.69, R = 0.82), which is on the southern coast of the mainland. South Korean eelgrass populations were substantially genetically divergent from one another (F-ST = 0.061 - 0.573), suggesting that limited contemporary gene flow has been taking place among populations. We also found weak but detectable temporal variation in genetic structure within a site over 10 years. In additional depth comparisons, statistically significant genetic differentiation was observed between shallow (or middle) and deep zones in two of three sites tested. Depleted genetic diversity, small effective population sizes (N-e) and limited connectivity for populations on Jeju Island indicate that these populations may be vulnerable to local extinction under changing environmental conditions, especially given that Jeju Island is one of the fastest warming regions around the world. Overall, our work will inform conservation and restoration efforts, including transplantation for eelgrass populations at the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, for this ecologically important species.

#Temporal stability in patterns of genetic diversity and structure of a marine foundation species (Zostera marina)
#Reynolds, LK, Stachowicz, JJ, Hughes, AR, Kamel, SJ, Ort, BS, Grosberg, RK
#2017
--------------------------------
Genetic diversity and population structure reflect complex interactions among a diverse set of processes that may vary temporally, limiting their potential to predict ecological and evolutionary outcomes. Yet, the stability of these patterns is rarely tested. We resampled eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows from published studies to determine variability in genetic diversity and structure within and between meadows over 5-12 years. The meadows sampled (San Francisco, Tomales and Bodega Bays in California and the Virginia coastal bays) represent a range of life histories (annual vs perennial), age (well-established vs restored) and environments (rural vs urbanized). In all of these systems, neither diversity nor differentiation (FST) changed over time. Differences among tidal heights within Bodega Bay were also remarkably consistent, with the high intertidal being more diverse than the subtidal, and tidal height differentiation being modest but significant at both time points. Historical studies used only a few microsatellite loci; therefore, our temporal comparisons were based on 4-5 loci. However, analysis of the current data using a set of 12 loci show that 4-5 loci are sufficient to describe diversity and differentiation patterns in this system. This temporal consistency was not because of the resampling of large clones, underscoring the feasibility and relevance of understanding drivers of the differences. Because seagrasses are declining at rapid rates, restoration and conservation are increasingly a coastal management priority. Our results argue that surveys of eelgrass genetic structure and diversity at decadal scales can provide accurate depictions of populations, increasing the utility of published genetic data for restoration and designing networks of reserves.

#Genetic distance predicts trait differentiation at the subpopulation but not the individual level in eelgrass, Zostera marina
#Abbott, JM, DuBois, K, Grosberg, RK, Williams, SL, Stachowicz, JJ
#2018
--------------------------------
Ecological studies often assume that genetically similar individuals will be more similar in phenotypic traits, such that genetic diversity can serve as a proxy for trait diversity. Here, we explicitly test the relationship between genetic relatedness and trait distance using 40 eelgrass (Zostera marina) genotypes from five sites within Bodega Harbor, CA. We measured traits related to nutrient uptake, morphology, biomass and growth, photosynthesis, and chemical deterrents for all genotypes. We used these trait measurements to calculate a multivariate pairwise trait distance for all possible genotype combinations. We then estimated pairwise relatedness from 11 microsatellite markers. We found significant trait variation among genotypes for nearly every measured trait; however, there was no evidence of a significant correlation between pairwise genetic relatedness and multivariate trait distance among individuals. However, at the subpopulation level (sites within a harbor), genetic (F-ST) and trait differentiation were positively correlated. Our work suggests that pairwise relatedness estimated from neutral marker loci is a poor proxy for trait differentiation between individual genotypes. It remains to be seen whether genomewide measures of genetic differentiation or easily measured master traits (like body size) might provide good predictions of overall trait differentiation.

#How Population Decline Can Impact Genetic Diversity: a Case Study of Eelgrass (Zostera marina) in Morro Bay, California
#Harencar, JG, Lutgen, GA, Taylor, ZM, Saarman, NP, Yost, JM
#2018
--------------------------------
Seagrass populations are in decline worldwide. Eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), one of California's native seagrasses, is no exception to this trend. In the last 8years, the estuary in Morro Bay, California, has lost 95% of its eelgrass. Population bottlenecks like this one often result in severe reductions in genetic diversity; however, this is not always the case. The decline of eelgrass in Morro Bay provides an opportunity to better understand the effects of population decline on population genetics. Furthermore, the failure of recent restoration efforts necessitates a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of the population. Previous research on eelgrass in California has demonstrated a link between population genetic diversity and eelgrass bed health, ecosystem functioning, and resilience to disturbance and extreme climatic events. The genetic diversity and population structure of Morro Bay eelgrass have not been assessed until this study. We also compare Morro Bay eelgrass to Bodega Bay eelgrass in Northern California. We conducted fragment length analysis of nine microsatellite loci on 133 Morro Bay samples, and 20 Bodega Bay samples. We found no population differentiation between the remaining beds in Morro Bay and no difference among samples growing at different tidal depths. Comparisons with Bodega Bay revealed that Morro Bay eelgrass contains three first-generation migrants from the north, but Morro Bay remains considerably genetically differentiated from Bodega Bay. Despite the precipitous loss of eelgrass in Morro Bay between 2008 and 2017, genetic diversity remains relatively high and comparable to other populations on the west coast.

#Seascape genetics and biophysical connectivity modelling support conservation of the seagrass Zostera marina in the Skagerrak-Kattegat region of the eastern North Sea
#Jahnke, M, Jonsson, PR, Moksnes, PO, Loo, LO, Jacobi, MN, Olsen, JL
#2018
--------------------------------
Maintaining and enabling evolutionary processes within meta-populations are critical to resistance, resilience and adaptive potential. Knowledge about which populations act as sources or sinks, and the direction of gene flow, can help to focus conservation efforts more effectively and forecast how populations might respond to future anthropogenic and environmental pressures. As a foundation species and habitat provider, Zostera marina (eelgrass) is of critical importance to ecosystem functions including fisheries. Here, we estimate connectivity of Z.marina in the Skagerrak-Kattegat region of the North Sea based on genetic and biophysical modelling. Genetic diversity, population structure and migration were analysed at 23 locations using 20 microsatellite loci and a suite of analytical approaches. Oceanographic connectivity was analysed using Lagrangian dispersal simulations based on contemporary and historical distribution data dating back to the late 19th century. Population clusters, barriers and networks of connectivity were found to be very similar based on either genetic or oceanographic analyses. A single-generation model of dispersal was not realistic, whereas multigeneration models that integrate stepping-stone dispersal and extant and historic distribution data were able to capture and model genetic connectivity patterns well. Passive rafting of flowering shoots along oceanographic currents is the main driver of gene flow at this spatial-temporal scale, and extant genetic connectivity strongly reflects the ghost of dispersal past sensu Benzie, . The identification of distinct clusters, connectivity hotspots and areas where connectivity has become limited over the last century is critical information for spatial management, conservation and restoration of eelgrass.
