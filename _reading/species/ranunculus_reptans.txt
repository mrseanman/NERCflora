#Genetic rescue persists beyond first-generation outbreeding in small populations of a rare plant
#Willi, Y Van Kleunen, M Dietrich, S Fischer, M
#2007
--------------------------------
Habitat fragmentation commonly causes genetic problems and reduced fitness when populations become small. Stocking small populations with individuals from other populations may enrich genetic variation and alleviate inbreeding, but such artificial gene flow is not commonly used in conservation owing to potential outbreeding depression. We addressed the role of long-term population size, genetic distance between populations and test environment for the performance of two generations of offspring from between-population crosses of the locally rare plant Ranunculus reptans L. Interpopulation outbreeding positively affected an aggregate measure of fitness, and the fitness superiority of interpopulation hybrids was maintained in the second offspring (F2) generation. Small populations benefited more strongly from interpopulation outbreeding. Genetic distance between crossed populations in neutral markers or quantitative characters was not important. These results were consistent under near-natural competition-free and competitive conditions. We conclude that the benefits of interpopulation outbreeding are likely to outweigh potential drawbacks, especially for populations that suffer from inbreeding.

#RAPD variation among and within small and large populations of the rare clonal plant Ranunculus reptans (Ranunculaceae).
#Fischer, M, Husi, R, Prati, D, Peintinger, M, van Kleunen, M, Schmid, B
#2000
--------------------------------
In the pre-alpine region of Europe numbers and sizes of populations of the clonal lake shore plant Ranunculus reptans have declined because of the regulation of lake water levels. We investigated genetic variation among and within 17 populations of different size (cover 1-10000 m(2)) in R. reptans with RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) profiles. We sampled 127 rosettes in populations at Lake Constance and three populations at or near Lake Come. There was significant genetic variation between plants from the two lake regions (5.9%, analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA], P < 0.001), among populations within lake regions (20.4%, P < 0.001), and within populations (73.7%. P < 0.001). Under the assumptions of Wright's island model the variation among populations corresponds to a gene Row of N(e)m = 0.70. Within the 14 Lake Constance populations we detected significant genetic variation among subpopulations separated by only a few metres (4.0% of the within-population variation; P < 0.05). Molecular variance was 24% smaller in small populations covering <100 m(2) area than in larger ones (P < 0.03), indicating that samples From large populations were genetically more variable than samples representing comparable areas of smaller populations. We conclude that gene how among populations is very limited and that genetic drift has caused reduced genetic variability of smaller populations. Conservation of genetic variability in R. reptans requires persistence of large and also of small populations (because of population differentiation). and it could be enhanced by increasing the size of small populations (to counter genetic drift).

#Genetic Allee effects on performance, plasticity and developmental stability in a clonal plant.
#Fischer, M, van Kleunen, M, Schmid, B
#2000
--------------------------------
Negative effects of small population size on fitness, so-called Allee effects, may threaten population persistence even in intact habitat remnants. We studied genotypes of 14 isolated populations of the clonal plant Ranunculus reptans, for which molecular genetic (RAPD-) variability is higher for large than for small populations. In a competition-free greenhouse environment vegetative offspring of genotypes from large populations produced more rosettes and flowers, indicating higher fitness. Within-genotype coefficients of variation in performance traits, indicating developmental instability, were lower for genotypes from populations with higher RAPD- variability. In competition with a taller grass, we found relative reduction in leaf length less pronounced for plants from large populations, suggesting higher adaptive plasticity. Our experimental study of a plant with predominantly vegetative reproduction suggests, that negative genetic effects of recent. habitat fragmentation, which so far rather were expected in plants with frequent sexual reproduction, are more severe and more common than previously acknowledged.

#Genetic differentiation of life-history traits within populations of the clonal plant Ranunculus reptans.
#Prati, D, Schmid, B
#2000
--------------------------------
We tested the hypothesis that environmental heterogeneity can maintain genetic variation in life-history traits within populations of the clonal plant Ranunculus reptans. This may be important for the further evolution and potential adaptation to environmental change. Moreover, we asked to what extent environmental heterogeneity can also reveal trade-offs among fitness components, in particular between sexual reproduction and clonal growth. In the natural habitat of R. reptans two distinct types of environment can often be found within 10 m distance: vegetation-sparse zones close to the water ("lake") and zones of competition with grasses (mostly Agrostis stolonifera) more inland ("land"). We grew vegetative offspring of 16 land genotypes and 16 take genotypes from four populations in a plant room. Cuttings from each genotype were grown with and without competition by the grass A. stolonifera and on two different substrates, sand and gravel. We found considerable environmental (E) and genetic (G) variation in life-history traits. Competition strongly reduced growth, branching, flowering, and final biomass. Lake genotypes invested mere into sexual reproduction (measured as proportion of ramets that flowered) whereas land genotypes invested more into vegetative reproduction (proportion of rooted ramets). Significant G x E interactions were consistent with a home-away effect: land-genotypes performed better if grown under competition, lake-genotypes without competition. These results indicate that genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits of R. reptans are maintained in a heterogeneous environment, thereby supporting the main hypothesis stated above. They further demonstrate that genetic differentiation occurs even over very short distances (10 m). We also found a significant genetic trade-off between sexual and vegetative reproduction (negative genetic correlation between the proportion of flowering ramets and the proportion of rooted ramets). in response to the supplementary question posed above, this suggests that the environmental heterogeneity finds its correspondence in the "genetic integration" of life- history traits within the phenotype of R. reptans.

#Local adaptation of the clonal plant Ranunculus reptans to flooding along a small-scale gradient.
#Lenssen, JPM, Van Kleunen, M, Fischer, M, De Kroon, H
#2004
--------------------------------
1 Plant species are known to segregate along small-scale flooding gradients. We tested whether differences in flooding duration can also result in genetic differentiation in the clonal species Ranunculus reptans, which naturally grows in both a lakeside microhabitat and a landside microhabitat with shorter periods of flooding. 2 We compared traits related to fitness, and clonal life-history traits, of 432 plants representing nine genotypes from each microhabitat, grown without flooding or with short or long flooding duration. We also determined aerenchyma contents and carbohydrate use efficiencies during flooding in plants of these 18 genotypes.  In the flooding treatments, genotypes from the lakeside microhabitat produced significantly more rosettes and rooted rosettes than genotypes from the landside microhabitat. This indicates small-scale local adaptation to flooding duration in R. reptans. 4 Unexpectedly, genotypes from the landside microhabitat had a higher proportion of aerenchyma in their roots than those from the lakeside microhabitat. Carbohydrate use efficiency was high in all genotypes. These physiological traits cannot therefore explain the observed local adaptation. 5 Genotypes from the lakeside microhabitat produced shorter stolon internodes than genotypes from the landside microhabitat when flooded. Moreover, in the treatment with long flooding duration, there was selection for reduced stolon internode lengths, which might help to reduce respiratory losses. This suggests that local adaptation is a consequence of differences in plasticity of internode length. 6 Our results indicate an important role for flooding in plant microevolution by demonstrating that variation in flooding duration can induce intraspecific specialization even within populations. Physiological traits that determine differences in flooding tolerance between species do not, however, seem to have played a key role in this differentiation.

#Experimental life-history evolution: Selection on the allocation to sexual reproduction and its plasticity in a clonal plant.
#van Kleunen, M, Fischer, M, Schmid, B
#2002
--------------------------------
Allocation to sexual reproduction is an important life-history trait in clonal plants. Different selection pressures between competitive and competition-free environments are likely to result in the evolution of specialized genotypes and to maintain genetic variation in reproductive allocation. Moreover, selection may also result in the evolution of plastic allocation strategies. The necessary prerequisite for evolution, heritable genetic variation, can best be studied with selection experiments. Starting from a base population of 102 replicated genotypes of the clonal herb Ranunculus reptans, we imposed selection on the proportion of flowering rosettes in the absence of competition (base population: mean = 0.391, broad-sense heritability = 0.307). We also selected on the plasticity in this trait in response to competition with a naturally coexisting grass in a parallel experiment (base population: 14% lower mean in the presence of competition, broad-sense heritability = 0.072). After two generations of bidirectional selection, the proportion of flowering rosettes was 26% higher in the high line than in the low line (realized heritability +/- SE = 0.205 +/- 0.017). Moreover, genotypes of the high line had 11% fewer carpels per flower, a 22% lower proportion of rooted rosettes, and a 39% smaller average distance between rosettes within a clone. In the second experiment, we found no significant responses to selection for high and low plasticity in the proportion of flowering rosettes (realized heritability +/- SE = -0.002 +/- 0.013). Our study indicates a high heritability and potential for further evolution of the proportion of flowering rosettes in R. reptans, but not for its plasticity, which may have been fixed by past evolution at its current level. Moreover, our results demonstrate strong genetic correlations between allocation to sexual reproduction and other clonal life-history characteristics.

#Adaptive evolution of plastic foraging responses in a clonal plant.
#van Kleunen, M, Fischer, M
#2001
--------------------------------
Stoloniferous rosette plants may show horizontal and vertical foraging responses, such as changes in branching frequency, stolon internode length, leaf length, and height growth of stolons. To study whether such plastic foraging responses constitute an adaptation to heterogeneity in competition, we studied genetic variation in and fitness consequences of plastic foraging responses in the stoloniferous lake-shore plant Ranunculus reptans. Because plastic foraging responses are likely to have been more strongly selected for in heterogeneous environments, we used 15 genotypes from competitive, heterogeneous microhabitats and 15 from competition-free, homogeneous microhabitats from Lake Constance (central Europe). We planted vegetatively propagated rosettes of the 30 genotypes (totaling 236 rosettes) into a greenhouse environment with spatially heterogeneous competition. Four replicates of each genotype were planted into the competition- free halves of experimental trays, and four other replicates into the halves with the naturally co-occurring grass Agrostis stolonifera. We found significant variation among genotypes in vertical and horizontal foraging responses. In line with the hypothesis of adaptive plasticity, genotypes from the competitive heterogeneous microhabitats more strongly increased the vertical angle of the first stolon internode (126%) and the specific stolon length (166%) in response to competition than genotypes from the competition-free homogeneous microhabitats. Moreover, we found that genotypes that were more plastic in the vertical angle of the first stolon internode, stolon height, and specific internode length produced more rosettes and flowers than less plastic genotypes (all selection gradients for plasticity > 0.316). Our findings strongly suggest that plastic foraging responses constitute an adaptation to environmental heterogeneity, at least in the stoloniferous R. reptans.
