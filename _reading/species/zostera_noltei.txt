--------------------------------
Background and Aims The dwarf eelgrass, Zostera noltii, is a predominant inhabitant of soft-bottom intertidal regions along the coasts of northern Europe. It is a monoecious, protogynous angiosperm in which the potential for self-fertilization and inbreeding are high, especially if clone sizes exceed pollen dispersal distances. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between mating system and clonal structure, examine the relative roles of geitonogamous selfing and biparental inbreeding, measure pollen availability (multiple paternities) and estimate pollen dispersal. Methods A 100-m(2) plot was established in a large, intertidal Z. noltii meadow on the island of Sylt in the German Wadden Sea. A total of 256 adult shoots was sampled: one from the centre of 100 fixed 1-m(2) quadrats (large scale resolution) and an additional 156 from within eight randomly selected 1-m(2) sub-quadrats (small-scale resolution). DNA was extracted from seeds and leaf tissue of all samples and genotyped with nine microsatellite loci. Key Results Mating system analysis revealed high multilocus and single locus outcrossing rates. Average pollen dispersal distance was nearly the same as the average genet (clone) size. Multiple paternity was common and 20-30% of mature seeds originated from matings within the plot. Among inbred seeds, most resulted from geitonogamy rather than biparental inbreeding. Conclusions Moderate disturbances intrinsic to the intertidal habitat appear to facilitate seed recruitment by gap formation. Pollen dispersal distances are sufficient to maintain outcrossing and high clonal diversity.

#The importance of reproductive strategies in population genetic approaches to conservation: an example from the marine angiosperm genus Zostera
#Provan, J Wilson, S Portig, AA Maggs, CA
#2008
--------------------------------
Knowledge of the levels of genetic diversity maintained in natural populations can play a central role in conservation programmes, particularly in threatened habitats or species. Fluctuations in population size can lead to loss of variation and, consequently, increase the risk of extinction. We have examined whether such a genetic bottleneck has occurred in populations of two species in the seagrass genus Zostera, which are believed to have been affected by an outbreak of wasting disease at the start of the last century. A test for heterozygote excess at five nuclear microsatellite loci did not suggest the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck, but analysis of seven chloroplast microsatellite loci and sequence data from two regions did suggest a bottleneck in the chloroplast genome. Extremely low levels of between-population diversity suggest that all subpopulations can be treated as a single management unit for each species. Comparable levels of nuclear genetic diversity were found in the three populations of the primarily sexual Zostera marina var. angustifolia studied but a wider range of within-population diversity was found in Zostera noltii, which displays both. sexual and vegetative reproductive strategies. This may be due to an increase in sexual recruitment due to localised fresh water inflow into the study site near to the most diverse population. Such populations should be prioritised as source material for any replanting or remediation due to natural or anthropogenic loss of Zostera beds in the area.

#Popoulation genetics of Zostera noltii along the west Iberian coast: consequences of small population size, habitat discontinuity and near-shore currents

--------------------------------
The effects of oceanographic patterns on marine genetic biodiversity along the SW Iberian Peninsula are poorly understood. We addressed the question of whether gene flow in this region depends solely on geographic distance between isolated patches of suitable habitat or if there are superimposed effects correlated with other factors such as current patterns. Zostera noltii, the dwarf eelgrass, is the keystone habitat-structuring seagrass species on intertidal mudflats along the Iberian west coast. We used 9 microsatellite loci to analyze population genetic diversity and differentiation for all existing 8 populations from NW Spain (Ria de Vigo) to SW Spain (Puerto Real, Cadiz). Populations are highly genetically differentiated as shown by high significant F-ST,Wright's fixation index, (0.08 to 0.26) values. A neighbor-joining tree based on Reynold's distances computed from allele frequencies revealed a split between northern and southern populations (bootstrap support of 84 %). This pattern of differentiation can be explained by (1) ocean surface current patterns present during Z. noltii's reproductive season which cause a dispersal barrier between the northern and southern populations of this region, (2) habitat isolation, due to large geographic distances between suitable habitats, preventing frequent gene flow, and (3) small effective population sizes, causing high drift and thus faster differentiation rates.

#Zostera noltei in the Canary Islands: A Genetic Description for Conservation Purposes
#Elso, MZ, Manent, P, Robaina, RR
#2018
--------------------------------
The extremely delicate situation affecting the seagrass Zostera noltii in the Canary Islands (listed as 'threatened with extinction') requires urgent measures to ensure its preservation. The genetic or genotypic description of populations and knowledge about their connectivity are important genetic issues that should be taken into account to accomplish appropriate conservation and restoration programmes, particularly for threatened habitats or species. Therefore, a genetic characterisation of the single remaining meadow located on the coast of Lanzarote was conducted using nine microsatellite loci, and its genetic relationship with the geographically closest Moroccan populations was studied for restoration purposes. Results showed that the Lanzarote population has recently suffered a significant reduction in effective population size and presents low levels of allelic or genotypic diversity in relation to other Z. noltii populations throughout its distribution range. Moreover, this population remains in an extremely isolated situation in which it lacks long-term gene flow with other Moroccan populations. These genetic factors, together with the lack of sexual reproduction (only vegetative growth via rhizomes has been reported) and high anthropogenic pressures, make the risk of extinction of this species in the Canarian archipelago more likely. Some considerations for future restoration plans for this valuable species are suggested.
