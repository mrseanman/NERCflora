#Interspecific hybridization in Rorippa (Brassicaceae): patterns and processes
#Bleeker, W
#2007
--------------------------------
The current knowledge on natural hybridization between European lowland Rorippo species is reviewed. Morphological, cytological and molecular markers provide substantial evidence that four Rorippa species (R. amphibia, R. austriaca, R. palustris and R. sylvestris) are involved in hybridization processes. The main factors promoting initial hybridization events between Rorippa species in Europe are (1) natural and anthropogenic habitat disturbance, (2) the invasion of non-native R. austriaca into western central Europe and (3) the self-incompatibility system of R. amphibia, R. austriaca and R. sylvestris coupled with clonal growth. Outcomes of hybridization between European Rorippa species show a broad range from incidental hybrids through the formation of hybrid swarms to the evolution of new hybrid taxa. Rorippo x armoracioides is certainly the most successful Rorippa hybrid. It results from hybridization between R. austriaca and R. sylvestris and is known from many localities in the native range of R. austriaca and in regions invaded by R. austriaca. Within this system hybrid zones of different age provide the rare opportunity to analyse different stages of hybrid formation and hybrid speciation in natural populations.
