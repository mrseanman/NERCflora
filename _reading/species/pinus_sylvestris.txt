#The mating system in a scots pine clonal seed orchard in Poland.
#Burczyk, J
#1991
--------------------------------
The mating system of a clonal seed orchard of Pinus sylvestris L consisting of 32 clones was studied using allozyme marker loci.  Single-locus estimates of outcrossing rate ranged from 0.907-1.106 (with a mean of 1.011), while the multilocus estimate was 0.987.  The outcrossing rates of individual trees ranged from 0.840-1.208.  The variance effective population size estimated for males was equivalent to 14 individuals. Some patterns of non-random mating were found.  The level of inbreeding as measured by average fixation indices was low, both in the parental and the filial generations.  The usefulness of Scots pine seed orchards in forest tree improvement has been discussed in the light of genetic efficiency.

#Mating system variation in a Scots pine clonal seed orchard.
#Burczyk, J
#1998
--------------------------------
The mating system was investigated in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seed orchard consisting of 32 clones, using 10 isozyme loci as genetic markers. The multilocus outcrossing rate calculated for the data pooled over three years of observations was estimated to be 0.987 (0.005). The population multilocus estimates of three consecutive years exhibited a decreasing trend (0.976, 0.966 and 0.962 for the years 1988 to 1990, respectively), but this variation was not significant. Individual outcrossing rates were homogeneous across years for most sampled ramets. Individual tree estimates were heterogeneous across sampled ramets for the pooled data in the years 1988 and 1990 but not for 1989. Individual outcrossing rates were not significantly related to individual pollen production. Although no significant variation of outcrossing rates in time could be detected, estimates of valiance effective population size in the three years suggest temporal variation in outcross mating patterns.

#Relationship of genotype for some allozyme loci and ability for self-pollination in Scotch pine.
#Isakov, YN, Semerikov, VL
#1997
--------------------------------
Linkage between the self-fertility level and genotype for 10 allozyme loci in Pinus sylvestris was investigated. A positive correlation of self-fertility with homozygosity between the three loci Dia, Got-B, and Got-C was found. In addition, homozygotes for the fast allele of the glutamate dehydrogenase locus Gdh were shown to possess a lower self-fertility level than other genotypes. It is assumed that these allozyme the loci are linked with loci responsible for preventing self-pollination.

#Comparing EST-based genetic maps between Pinus sylvestris and Pinus taeda.
#Komulainen, P, Brown, GR, Mikkonen, M, Karhu, A, Garcia-Gil, MR, O'Malley, D, Lee, B, Neale, DB, Savolainen, O
#2003
--------------------------------
A genetic map of Pinus sylvestris was constructed using ESTP (expressed sequence tag polymorphism) markers and other gene- based markers, AFLP markers and microsatellites. Part of the ESTP markers (40) were developed and mapped earlier in Pinus taeda, and additional markers were generated based on P. sylvestris sequences or sequences from other pine species. The mapping in P. sylvestris was based on 94 F-1 progeny from a cross between plus-tree parents E635C and E1101. AFLP framework maps for the parent trees were first constructed. The ESTP and other gene sequence-based markers were added to the framework maps, as well as five published microsatellite loci. The separate maps were then integrated with the aid of AFLPs segregating in both trees (dominant segregation ratios 3:1) as well as gene markers and microsatellites segregating in both parent trees (segregation ratios 1:1:1:1 or 1:2:1). The integrated map consisted of 12 groups corresponding to the P. taeda linkage groups, and additionally three and six smaller groups for E1101 and E635C, respectively. The number of framework AFLP markers in the integrated map is altogether 194 and the number of gene markers 61. The total length of the integrated map was 1,314 cM. The set of markers developed for P. sylvestris was also added to existing maps of two P. taeda pedigrees. Starting with a mapped marker from one pedigree in the source species resulted in a mapped marker in a pedigree of the other species in more than 40% of the cases, with about equal success in both directions. The maps of the two species are largely colinear, even if the species have diverged more than 70 MYA. Most cases of different locations were probably due to problems in identifying the orthologous members of gene families. These data provide a first ESTP-containing map of P. sylvestris, which can also be used for comparing this species to additional species mapped with the same markers.

#Genetic structure and variation in Pinus sylvestris L. populations degrading due to pollution-induced injury.
#Korshikov, II, Velikoridko, TI, Butilskaya, LA
#2002
--------------------------------
The comparative study of genetic variation and differentiation of Ukraine's south-eastern five marginal Pinus sylvestris L. populations (which are differently damaged by emissions of large chemical enterprises producing mineral fertilizers, plastics and organic dyes and are degrading through it) was performed using the electrophoretic analysis of 9 gene-enzymous systems, encoded by 22 loci. About 82% of P. sylvestris genes have been found to be in a polymorphic state and each tree is on the average heterozygous in 22.3% of its genes. In the most degrading population which is 0.3 km from the main provenances of air pollutants mean indices of genetic polymorphism were lower, a number of alleles per a locus - by 18%, genotypes - by 13%, observed heterozygosity - by 12% and expected one - by 9% compared to the far removed population (more than 100 km). Those mean indices in two damaged-degrading populations were also by 7.9% to 16.7% lower than in three populations of the background and not polluted zone. The populations under consideration are weakly differentiated, NEI'S genetic distance coefficient varied within 0.004 to 0.014, accounting at an average for 0.008. For the population degrading due to the untimely elimination of trees, damaged by pollutants, the values of these coefficients compared with the rest four populations did not exceed the average level.

#Properties of AFLP markers in inheritance and genetic diversity studies of Pinus sylvestris L..
#Lerceteau, E, Szmidt, AE
#1999
--------------------------------
We analysed the properties of AFLP markers in Pinus sylvestris. Using primers with three selective nucleotides, the AFLP protocol produced large numbers of amplified bands and could only be used with a restricted number of primer combinations. Replacement of the EcoRI + 3 primer by an EcoRI + 4 primer halved the number of bands, facilitating analysis. The inheritance of all but about 8.4% of the amplified bands has been confirmed to be Mendelian. We compared band patterns among selected P. sylvestris trees from northern Sweden, two Asian species of Pinus and one species from the genus Picea. The dendrogram obtained was generally concordant with the taxonomic data, although the genetic similarity values between trees from different genera did not entirely follow accepted inter- and intraspecific relationships. This deviation was less pronounced using primer combinations that generated fewer bands. More than 69.1% of the bands that were polymorphic in two P. sylvestris trees or 29 of their F-1 progeny were in a pseudo-testcross configuration and thus were useful for the development of a linkage map for each parent. These markers have been analysed in four other crosses, and 83% of the bands could be mapped in at least one cross. Depending on the level of heterozygosity of the parents, the efficiency of such mapping will vary, but the AFLP technique appears to be a powerful way to generate, very quickly, large numbers of markers that are useful for constructing and comparing linkage maps.

#The mating system outcrossing rate and genetic differentiation in natural Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations from Bulgaria.
#Longauer, R, Zhelev, P, Paule, L, Gomory, D
#1992
--------------------------------
Mating system and outcrossing rates were investigated in two Scots pine populations from the Rodopi mountains, Bulgaria (850 m or 1750 m a. s. l., respectively).  The multilocus outcrossing rates were 0.986 +/- 0.029 and 0.934 +/- 0.023, while the mean observed heterozygosities (H(o)) based on 9 investigated loci were 0.459 and 0.396 and the fixation indices were 0.125 and 0.071.  The differentiation between 6 populations based on allelic frequencies is low and no significant differences between populations (except GOT-C) were found.

#Genetic variation in the natural pollen cloud of Pinus sylvestris - a study based on progeny testing.
#Nilsson, JE
#1995
--------------------------------
Seeds from open pollination of individual female stroboli on different days in June 1990 in a coastal clone archive of Pinus sylvestris (L.) in northern Sweden (latitude 63-degrees 39' N) were used for a short-term progeny experiment to study differences over time in the genetic composition of the background pollen.  Analysis of progeny growth and cold acclimatization in artificial whole-plant freezing tests suggested no genetic differences in the fertilizing pollen between pollination days.  A clinal variation with the latitude of pollen origin was observed for reference progenies from fertilization with pollen of known geographical origin. Comparisons between open-pollinated progenies and reference progenies indicate that the pollen cloud originated from approximately 1-degree latitude (based on height growth) or 1.5-degree latitude (based on freezing injury) north of the pollination site.

#Identification and characterization of RAPD markers inferring genetic relationships among Pine species.
#Nkongolo, KK, Michael, P, Gratton, WW
#2002
--------------------------------
Total genomic DNAs were extracted from several populations of pine species and amplified using oligonucleotides of random sequences. Polymorphism in random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers was high and sufficient in distinguishing each of the species. Genetic relationships among eight pine species (Pinus sylvestris, Pinus strobus, Pinus rigida, Pinus resinosa, Pinus nigra, Pinus contorta, Pinus monticola, and Pinus banksiana) from different provenances were analyzed. The degree of band sharing was used to evaluate genetic distance between species and to construct a phylogenetic tree. In general, the dendrogram corroborated the description of relationships based on morphological characteristics and crossability, but also provided new insights into pine taxonomy. RAPD markers specific to some pine species were cloned and sequenced. PCR amplifications using pairs of designed specific primers revealed that all the cloned sequences were likely genus specific because they were not found in spruce or larch. True species-specific sequences were identified using designed primers flanking cloned RAPD fragments. The analysis of RAPD fragment sequences confirmed the genetic relationships among species. A 2281-bp RAPD band called PI-Mt-Stb-23 from P. strobus was used as a probe in restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and produced distinct banding patterns for each species examined, consistent with the highly polymorphic character of DNA-fingerprinting probes.

#Increased selfing and correlated paternity in a small population of a predominantly outcrossing conifer, Pinus sylvestris.
#Robledo-Arnuncio, JJ, Alia, R, Gil, L
#2004
--------------------------------
Outcrossing rate, the rates of ovule and seed abortion, and levels of correlated paternity were estimated in a small population of Pinus sylvestris, a predominantly outcrossing conifer, and were compared with estimates from two widely dispersed woodlands of the same species, showing a range of densities. On average, seed trees of the small population showed an eight-fold higher selfing rate (25 vs. 3%) and a 100- fold greater incidence of correlated paternity (19.6 vs. 0.2%) than did trees from the large populations. No evidence was found of pollen limitation within the remnant stand, as suggested by ovule abortion rates. Investigation of the mating patterns in the small population, based on the unambiguous genealogy of 778 open-pollinated seeds, showed a large departure from random mating. Only 8% of the possible mating pairs within the stand were observed. Correlated paternity rate within a maternal sibship was negatively associated (r(s) = - 0.398, P < 0.050) with the distance to the nearest neighbour, and shared paternity among maternal sibships was negatively correlated (r(s) = -0.704, P < 0.001) with the distance between seed trees. Numerical simulations, based on the estimated individual pollen dispersal kernel, suggest that restricted dispersal might have been the key factor affecting mating patterns in the small population and, together with low population density, may account for the observed mating system variation between the small and the large populations. The results of this study show that a severe size reduction may substantially affect the mating system of a wind-pollinated, typically outcrossed plant species.

#Nearly complete genetic maps of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) constructed by AFLP marker analysis in a full-sib family.
#Yin, TM, Wang, XR, Andersson, B, Lerceteau-Kohler, E
#2003
--------------------------------
We have constructed nearly complete linkage maps of Pinus sylvestris (L.) using AFLP markers based on a two-way pseudo- testcross strategy in a full-sib family founded in an advanced breeding program. With 39 primer combinations, a total of 737 markers (320 from the mother and 417 froth the father) segregated in a 1:1 ratio, corresponding to DNA polymorphism: heterozygous in one parent and null in the other. In the maternal parent, 188 framework markers were mapped in 12 linkage groups, equivalent to the Pinus haploid chromosome number, with a total coverage of 1,695.5 cM. In the paternal parent, 245 framework markers established a map with 15 linkage groups, spanning a genome length of 1,718.5 cM. The estimated total map length was (L) over cap (F) = 1, 681 cM for the female and (L) over cap (M) = 1, 645 cM for the male using a modified method-of-moment estimator. Combining these values with those estimated from the observed map lengths in both parents, we estimated the genome length in Scots pine to be between 1,600 and 2,100 cM. Our genome coverage was estimated to be more than 98% with a framework marker interval of 20 cM for both parents. Most of the female and male linkage groups were associated through the analysis of the intercross markers.

#Changes of genetic structure of Pinus sylvestris L populations exposed to industrial pollution.
#WojnickaPoltorak, A
#1997
--------------------------------
Isoenzymatic variation of Pinus sylvestris was analysed in populations from a provenance trial (IUFRO 1982) in Kornik and their replication in Lubon. The two groups of populations originated from the same seed pool, but the one in Lubon was exposed to pollutants emitted during the production of nitrogen-phosphorus fertilizers,while the Kornik provenance trial were used as a control group. The parameters determining the genetic structure of the studied populations - frequency of alleles and genotypes (average number of alleles and genotypes per locus), observed heterozygosity (H-o), and genotypic polymorphism index (P-g) - have higher values in the group of trees tolerant to pollution. Also fixation index (F), which indicates that homozygotic genotypes underwent selection in this group, as well as dendrites and dendrograms according to Nei and Hedrick, suggest that the genetic structure of the populations exposed to pollution was changed. The obtained results indicate that populations characterized by a greater genetic diversity are more tolerant to pollution.

#Patterns of pollen dispersal in a small population of Pinus sylvestris L. revealed by total-exclusion paternity analysis.
#Robledo-Arnuncio, JJ and Gi,l L
#2005
--------------------------------
 Patterns of pollen dispersal were investigated in a small, isolated, relict population of Pinus sylvestris L., consisting of 36 trees. A total-exclusion battery comprising four chloroplast and two nuclear microsatellites (theoretical paternity exclusion probability EP¼0.996) was used to assign paternity to 813 seeds, collected from 34 trees in the stand. Longdistance pollen immigration accounted for 4.3% of observed matings. Self-fertilization rate was very high (0.25), compared with typical values in more widespread populations of the species. The average effective pollen dispersal distance within the stand was 48m (or 83m excluding selfs). Half of effective pollen was dispersed within 11 m, and 7% beyond 200 m. A strong correlation was found between the distance to the closest tree and the mean mating-distance calculated for single-tree progenies. The effective pollen dispersal distribution showed a leptokurtic shape, with a large and significant departure from that expected under uniform dispersal. A maximum-likelihood procedure was used to fit an individual pollen dispersal distance probability density function (dispersal kernel). The estimated kernel indicated fairly leptokurtic dispersal (shape parameter b¼0.67), with an average pollen dispersal distance of 135 m, and 50% of pollen dispersed beyond 30 m. A marked directionality pattern of pollen dispersal was found, mainly caused by the uneven distribution of trees, coupled with restricted dispersal and unequal male success. Overall, results show that the number and distribution of potential pollen donors in small populations may strongly influence the patterns of effective pollen dispersal.

#Genetic variation in height, branch and needle lengths of Pinus sylvestris L. from Siberia tested in Alberta, Canada.
#Rweyongeza, DM, Yeh, FC, Dancik, BP, Dhir, NK
#2003
--------------------------------
We performed the analysis of variance and covariance on height, branch length, height to branch length ratio, and needle length measurements from thirty open-pollinated families of Pinus sylvestris L. from Siberia, Russia. This progeny trial was replicated on three sites in central Alberta, Canada. At six years from seeds, there was statistically significant variation for height, branch length to height ratio and needle length. On individual test sites, values of individual-tree heritability for height ranged from 0.20 to 0.35, whereas values of heritability for family means ranged from 0.41 to 0.59. These low to moderate heritabilities suggest that a combination of family and within-family selection would be effective in improving height growth for this population on individual sites. Across sites, values, of individual-tree. heritability for height ranged from 0.03 to 0.06, whereas values for heritability of family means ranged from 0.17 to 0.29. These low heritabilities across sites were due to high genotype by environment (GE) interaction. Analysis showed that 87% to 99% of the GE interaction was due to lack of genetic correlation among sites. Heterogeneity of the genetic variance among test sites contributed 1% to 13% of the GE interaction. This shows that families in this population of Scots pine are not broadly adapted and are therefore suitable only for a site-specific breeding programme. The paper also presents and discusses results of other traits with emphasis to breeding Scots pine for production of Christmas trees, which is the main use of this species in North America.

#Genetic variance and covariance patterns of growth and survival in northern Pinus sylvestris.
#Persson, T, Andersson, B
#2003
--------------------------------
The amount of additive genetic and environmental variance for tree height and field survival, and the genetic relationship between the traits were estimated using data from half-sib progenies of Swedish and Finnish Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) plus-trees, assessed in 18 single-tree plot progeny trials. The progeny trials were established in northern Sweden and comprised 9-13-yr-old, Finnish polycross progenies or Swedish open-pollinated progenies. In total across the trials, 71 630 individual trees from 888 families were included in the study. At the overall level, the additive genetic coefficient of variation ranged between 3.1 and 16.3% for height and between 0 and 27.9% for survival, with averages of 9.5% and 14.2%, respectively. Narrow-sense heritabilities were moderate to low, with averages across trials of 0.11 for height and 0.06 for survival. At the within-population level, estimates of genetic correlation between height and survival were mostly large and positive, with an arithmetic mean and standard error across trials of 0.47+/-0.39.

#Intraspecific responses to climate in Pinus sylvestris.
#Rehfeldt, GE, Tchebakova, NM, Parfenova, YI, Wykoff, WR, Kuzmina, NA, Milyutin, LI
#2002
--------------------------------
Five population-specific response functions were developed from quadratic models for 110 populations of Pinus sylvestris growing at 47 planting sites in Eurasia and North America. The functions predict 13 year height from climate: degree-days > 5 degreesC; mean annual temperature; degree-days < 0 degreesC; summer-winter temperature differential; and a moisture index, the ratio of degree-days > 5 degreesC to mean annual precipitation. Validation of the response functions with two sets of independent data produced for all functions statistically significant simple correlations with coefficients as high as 0.81 between actual and predicted heights. The response functions described the widely different growth potentials typical of natural populations and demonstrated that these growth potentials have different climatic optima. Populations nonetheless tend to inhabit climates colder than their optima, with the disparity between the optimal and inhabited climates becoming greater as the climate becomes more severe. When driven by a global warming scenario of the Hadley Center, the functions described short-term physiologic and long-term evolutionary effects that were geographically complex. The short-term effects should be negative in the warmest climates but strongly positive in the coldest. Long- term effects eventually should ameliorate the negative short- term impacts, enhance the positive, and in time, substantially increase productivity throughout most of the contemporary pine forests of Eurasia. Realizing the long-term gains will require redistribution of genotypes across the landscape, a process that should take up to 13 generations and therefore many years.

#Genetic variation within and between populations of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) for susceptibility to Melampsora pinitorqua Rostr. (pine twist rust).
#Quencez, C, Bastien, C
#2001
--------------------------------
The genetic variability of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) for twist rust susceptibility and the consequences for genetic improvement of the species were evaluated after artificial inoculation of 1-year-old seedlings in greenhouse tests. Wind- pollinated progenies, factorial and incomplete diallel mating designs were used to compare two natural populations of Scots pine (Haguenau, France, and Taborz, Poland) and their hybrids (Haguenau x Taborz). Families from Taborz were significantly (P < 0.001) less susceptible to twist rust than those from Haguenau. Inter-population hybrids were as susceptible as the Haguenau population. No clear relationship between severity of infection, shoot length and phenological stage at time of inoculation was observed in intra- and interpopulation crosses. Differences observed between the two natural populations for their response to twist rust are suggested to be the consequence of local adaptation simultaneously for climatic conditions and pathogen pressure. Within each of the two populations, the effects of general combining abilities (GCA) for rust susceptibility were predominant, although estimation of individual heritabilities remained at a moderate level (0.30-0.54). In interpopulation crosses, GCA effects of Haguenau and Taborz populations were still predominant. Moreover, hybrid performance could be predicted with confidence based on the intrapopulation GCA values of parents. Genetic gain on twist rust resistance could be achieved quickly through intrapopulation mass or backward selection based on wind- pollinated progeny tests.

#AFLP mapping and detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for economically important traits in Pinus sylvestris: a preliminary study.
#Lerceteau, E, Plomion, C, Andersson, B
#2000
--------------------------------
We have applied a two-way pseudo-testcross strategy in an analysis of Pinus sylvestris for genetic mapping and detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with economically important traits targeted in the Swedish tree-breeding programme. Based on 94 full-sib progeny of a cross between two plus-trees from northern Sweden we generated two parental maps using AFLP markers. The female map was comprised of 94 markers assigned to 15 linkage groups giving a size of 796 cM. On the male map 155 markers were assigned to 15 linkage groups, giving a total size of 1335 cM. The recombination frequency was found to be sex-dependent, being 29.3% higher in male than in female gametes. On the female map, 12 QTLs were detected (but none for branch diameter or wood density). Three QTLs for tree height accounted for 25.8% of the total phenotypic variation of this trait. When the QTLs detected for all the traits were taken independently, the percentages of phenotypic variance ranged from 9.3% to 22.7%. The highest value was observed for frost hardiness, an important trait in northern Sweden for which a major gene seemed to be involved. A cluster of QTLs for tree height, trunk diameter and volume was located on one linkage group. On the male map, four QTLs for trunk diameter and volume were detected. Due to the reduced number of individuals under study, the results are preliminary and have to be validated on more trees.

#Comparison of homology and linkage of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers between individual trees of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.).
#Hurme, P, Savolainen, O
#1999
--------------------------------
Segregation, homology and linkage of 33 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) in three trees [P304, E1101 and F1 (cross P315 x E1101)] of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Markers were selected on the basis of a RAPD map constructed earlier for F1. Markers from three linkage groups were studied in P304 and E1101. In both P304 and E1101, 14 markers (42%) were heterozygous. Segregation deviating from 1:1 was found for three markers in P304 and one marker in E1101. With the restriction pattern test, two out of the 33 loci studied (6%) were found to be not homologous to the corresponding fragment in F1. Both of these loci were heterozygous, and they were not linked to any markers, which confirmed their nonhomology. Homologous heterozygous markers segregating 1:1 were mostly linked with similar order in P304 and E1101 as in F1. The results suggest that it might be necessary to verify the homology of comigrating fragments before using them even across individuals. It will often be desirable to use other codominant markers together with RAPDs.

#Relation between genetic structure and susceptibility to air pollution of European pinus sylvestris populations from a IUFRO-1982 provenance experiment.
#Prus-Glowacki, W, Oleksyn, J, Reich, PB
#1998
--------------------------------
Results are presented of genetic variation and relation between genetic parameters with growth, survival and needle necroses of 11 European Pinus sylvestris populations growing in a provenance experiment established in 1984 in western Poland. One site was near a phosphate fertilizer factory, and other in an area free of acute air pollution. A significant differences were found between studied sites in number of alleles per locus: expected and observed heterozygosity, genotype polymorphism indices (all p < 0.1) and in tree height (p < 0.0001). On average all genetic parameters were higher for polluted site than for a control one. Differences in observed heterozygosity were related to height growth decline and plant mortality.

#Relation between genetic diversity and pollution impact in a 1912 experiment with east European Pinus sylvestris provenances.
#Oleksyn, J, Prusglowacki, W, Giertych, M, Reich, PB
#1994
--------------------------------
Results are presented of genetic variation and growth decline due to pollution for 11 European populations, 1 Turkish population, and 1 Siberian population of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in a provenance experiment established in 1912 in Pulawy, southeastern Poland. Since 1966 this area has been subjected to acute pollution from a nitrogen- fertilizer factory emitting high levels of SO2, NOx, NH3, and other toxic compounds. A significant negative correlation was found between genotype polymorphism indices and radial growth decline since 1966 assessed using tree-ring analysis (r = - 0.58, P = 0.04). Populations with the highest values for genotype polymorphism index, numbers of alleles per locus, and numbers of genotypes per locus exhibited less of a decline in radial growth than those populations with lower values for these parameters. The results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that genetically richer populations are better adapted to changing conditions and suggest that such populations are less sensitive to air pollution in terms of growth reduction.

#Evidence of natural reciprocal hybridisation between Pinus uliginosa and P. sylvestris in the sympatric population of the species
#Wachowiak, W, Celinski, K and Prus-Glowacki, W
#2005
--------------------------------
Peat-bog pine Pinus uliginosa Neumann has become extinct or rare in many parts of Europe. It is supposed to hybridize with P. sylvestris but the influence of hybridization to genetic erosion of the P. uliginosa gene pool is unknown. In the presented study, the crossability between P. uliginosa and P. sylvestris was analyzed in a sympatric population at Wggliniec reserve in Poland. The aim of the study was to prove natural hybridisation and to estimate the influence of this phenomenon on possible natural gene pool erosion of peat-bog pine. A sequence polymorphism in the trnF-trnL cpDNA region of P. uliginosa and P. sylvestris was used to develop the species diagnostic PCR-RFLP marker. The marker of paternally transmitted cpDNA was applied in haplotype analyses of the progeny from open-pollinated P. uliginosa seeds (collected in 2000-2002) and from P. sylvestris ones (in 2002). An inconsistency in species diagnostic cpDNA haplotypes of seedlings and parental trees was observable both for P. uliginosa and P. sylvestris (about 1% and 2% of hybrids seeds, respectively). The results prove the occurrence of reciprocal hybridisation between the species. The influence of hybridisation on the natural gene pool protection and measures to reintroduce peat-bog pine is discussed.

#Spontaneous hybridization between Pinus sylvestris L. and P. mugo Turra in Slovakia
#Kormutak, A Demankova, B Gomory, D
#2008
--------------------------------
Molecular evidence for spontaneous hybridization between Pinus sylvestris L. and R mugo Turra in the putative hybrid swarm populations of the species in Slovakia was provided based on PCR-RFLP analysis of the cpDNA trnV-trnH region. Species-specific restriction profiles generated by Hinf I digests of the cpDNA products reliably identified R sylvestris and R mugo haplotypes of the embryos from open pollination. Simultaneous analysis of the respective cpDNA region in megaga-metophytes and embryos of individual seeds along with needles of a given maternal tree has enabled to score either the R sylvestris or R mugo haplotypes in the embryos illustrating hybridization patterns between the two species. Data obtained in this way indicate a relatively extensive hybridization which takes place between R sylvestris and R mugo. The extent of hybridization varied among populations as evidenced by the 41.1-58.7% proportion of hybrid embryos registered on the locality Habovka, and by the 8.3% and 2.7% proportions of hybrid embryos on the localities Tisovnica and Sucha Hora, respectively. The approach itself is recommended as a convenient method for monitoring the hybridization patterns in sympatric zones of the studied pine species.

#Allozyme variation of seed embryos and mating system in relict populations of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) from the Kremenets Hill Ridge and Maloe Poles'e
#Korshikov II, Kalafat LA, Lisnichuk AN, Velicoridko TI, Mudrik EA
#2011
--------------------------------
Allozyme variation at ten polymorphic loci and mating system was studied in three small isolated relict populations (4.4 to 22 ha) and in three artificial stands of Pinus sylvestris from the Kremenets Hill Ridge and Maloe Poles'e. It was established that the mean heterozygosity of 130 to 140 year-old trees from natural populations (H (O) = 0.288; H (E) = 0.277) was substantially lower, compared to 30 to 40 year-old trees from artificial stands (H (O) = 0.358; H (E) = 0.330). The observed heterozygosity of seed embryos (H (O) = 0.169 and 0.180) was substantially lower than of the mature trees from populations and artificial stands, respectively. In the embryo samples, irrespectively of the forest stand origin, substantial hetedrozygote deficiency was observed (at six to eight loci), compared to the Hardy-Weinberg expectations. The proportion of cross pollination in the populations and artificial stands was low, t (m) = 0.588 to 0.721; and t (m) = 0.455 to 0.837, respectively.

#High genetic diversity at the extreme range edge: nucleotide variation at nuclear loci in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Scotland
#Wachowiak W, Salmela MJ, Ennos RA, Iason G, Cavers S
#2011
--------------------------------
Nucleotide polymorphism at 12 nuclear loci was studied in Scots pine populations across an environmental gradient in Scotland, to evaluate the impacts of demographic history and selection on genetic diversity. At eight loci, diversity patterns were compared between Scottish and continental European populations. At these loci, a similar level of diversity (theta(sil) = similar to B0.01) was found in Scottish vs mainland European populations, contrary to expectations for recent colonization, however, less rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium was observed in the former (rho = 0.0086 +/- 0.0009, rho = 0.0245 +/- 0.0022, respectively). Scottish populations also showed a deficit of rare nucleotide variants (multi-locus Tajima's D = 0.316 vs D = -0.379) and differed significantly from mainland populations in allelic frequency and/or haplotype structure at several loci. Within Scotland, western populations showed slightly reduced nucleotide diversity (pi(tot) = 0.0068) compared with those from the south and east (0.0079 and 0.0083, respectively) and about three times higher recombination to diversity ratio (rho/theta = 0.71 vs 0.15 and 0.18, respectively). By comparison with results from coalescent simulations, the observed allelic frequency spectrum in the western populations was compatible with a relatively recent bottleneck (0.00175 x 4N(e) generations) that reduced the population to about 2% of the present size. However, heterogeneity in the allelic frequency distribution among geographical regions in Scotland suggests that subsequent admixture of populations with different demographic histories may also have played a role.

#High genetic similarity between Polish and North European Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations at nuclear gene loci
#Wachowiak, Witold, Wojkiewicz, Blazej, Cavers, Stephen, Lewandowski, Andrzej
#2014
--------------------------------
Nucleotide polymorphisms in a set of 32 nuclear genes were studied in 19 mountain, peatbog and lowland populations of Scots pine representing known phenotypic races and populations of presumably relict character for the species in Poland. At 29 genes, the pattern of genetic variation was compared to 11 reference populations from Northern, Western and Southern Europe. Similar levels of nucleotide polymorphism and excess of low-frequency mutations were observed in Polish populations (pi (tot) = 0.0055, D = -0.308) and as compared to the reference samples (pi (tot) = 0.0054, D = -0.170). Bayesian assignment and conventional frequency-based statistics indicate that Polish populations share the same genetic background at the analysed nuclear gene markers. However, the populations showed a much closer genetic relationship with North European samples than other regional groups of populations. Across the very uniform genetic background of the populations, we identified several genes with outlier patterns of haplotype, polymorphism frequency variation and departures from compound neutrality tests. Our data indicate that the Central and North European parts of the Scots pine distribution seem particularly suitable for association genetic studies to link phenotypic and genetic variation at a large geographical scale.

#Development of new mitochondrial DNA markers in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) for population and phylogeographic studies
#Semerikov, V. L., Putintseva, Yu. A., Oreshkova, N. V., Semerikova, S. A., Krutovsky, K. V.
#2015
--------------------------------
Fragments of genomic DNA of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) homologous to the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contigs of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) were resequenced in a sample of the Scots pine trees of European, Siberian, Mongolian, and Caucasian origin in order to develop mtDNA markers. Flanking non-coding regions of some mitochondrial genes were also investigated and resequenced. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a single minisatellite locus were identified. Caucasian samples differed from the rest by three SNPs. Two SNPs have been linked to an early described marker in the first intron of the nad7 gene, and all together revealed three haplotypes in European populations. No variable SNPs were found in the Siberian and Mongolian populations. The minisatellite locus contained 41 alleles across European, Siberian, and Mongolian populations, but, this locus demonstrated a weak population differentiation (F (ST) = 5.8), probably due to its high mutation rate.

#Genetic relationships between Polish and reference populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Europe based on nucleotide polymorphism study at nuclear loci
#Wachowiak, Witold
#2015
--------------------------------
Adaptation to local environmental gradients is one of main characteristics of living organisms. Scots pine (Finns sylvestris L.) is the most widely distributed conifer in the world and main forest forming component in Europe. Based on genetic, morphological and growth performance traits, several local ecotypes of the species were distinguished across the species distribution range. The existence of local ecotypes differentiated at many adaptive and phenotypic traits provides unique opportunity for addressing the questions about the genetic basis of local adaptation across the species distribution range. However, information about the underlying population structure between ecotypes is needed for efficient studies of adaptive variation at molecular level. The presented study focused on the genetic variation analysis between nineteen populations of Scots pine from across geographical locations in Poland and eleven reference samples from Northern, Western and Southern Europe. The pattern of nucleotide polymorphisms at 673 polymorphic nucleotide sites found across twenty nine nuclear loci was studied to determine genetic relationship and population structure of different geographical locations. Genetic relationships between populations were conducted based on Baysian assignment and conventional frequency based statistics at the within and between population level. The results indicate very uniform genetic background of Polish populations of the species that despite high phenotypic and ecological differentiation most likely share the same recolonization history. High genetic similarity was found between Polish and North European range of the species. In contrast, differentiation was found in relation to the reference populations from Scotland and Spain that in previous studies were shown to deviate from simple recolonization model after last glaciations and had unique mtDNA mitotypes not observed in continental continuous range of the species, respectively. Considering high differentiation at quantitative traits between northern and central part of the species range in Europe but very homogenous genetic background found in the presented study, it seems that this part of Scots pine distribution is particularly suitable for association genetic studies to find genomic regions that are involved in species adaptive and phenotypic variation.

#Interspecific gene flow and ecological selection in a pine (Pinus sp.) contact zone
#Wachowiak, Witold, Cavers, Stephen, Zukowska, Weronika B.
#2015
--------------------------------
Nucleotide polymorphisms in a set of nuclear genes were studied in a sympatric population of pines Pinus mugo and Pinus sylvestris that includes trees classified as pure species and polycormic (multi-stemmed) individuals of potentially hybrid origin. Patterns of genetic diversity were compared between those groups of samples and to the reference allopatric populations of the species in Europe. Polymorphisms at the gene loci clearly distinguished pure parental species as measured by conventional frequency-based statistics and Bayesian assignment of samples into separate genetic clusters. Most individuals classified based on phenotypic assessments as putative hybrids were genetically very similar to P. mugo showing no existing average net divergence and genetic assignment to the same genetic cluster. On the other hand, individuals of P. sylvestris showed homogenous genetic background to the reference populations of the species from Central and Northern Europe. Ten individuals of admixed genetic composition were found in all three groups of samples; however, the majority of hybrids except one individual were identified across the samples classified as P. mugo and polycormic pines. Those trees that contained a mixture of nuclear gene haplotypes observed in the reference populations of pure species and cpDNA from P. mugo, most likely represent the first generation of hybrids. Analysis of the allelic frequency spectra and compound neutrality tests identified deviations from neutrality at several genes. This contact zone seems suitable for selection of a mapping population both in hybrid and parental species for admixture mapping to effectively search for polymorphisms that may play role in species adaptive variation and speciation.

#Genetic variation for needle traits in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
#Donnelly, K, Cavers, S, Cottrell, JE, Ennos, RA
#2016
--------------------------------
The remnants of the Caledonian Native Pinewood are distributed across a relatively narrow geographic area in the Scottish Highlands yet inhabit a steep environmental gradient in terms of rainfall, temperature and altitude. Previous work based on common garden trials has demonstrated that native pine populations (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) exhibit differentiation in terms of growth, phenology and frost resistance. However, despite their important role in plant fitness, no such information is available on leaf traits, which have shown both plastic and adaptive genetic responses to environmental variation in other species. We analysed a subset of 11 needle characters in 192 saplings grown in a population-progeny common garden trial based on seedlots from eight native pinewoods. Narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) was estimated for each trait and found to be particularly high (1.30 +/- 0.33) for resin canal density. The majority of the phenotypic variation found was within populations, although interpopulation differentiation was detected for needle length (Delta AICc = 2.55). Resin canal density was positively correlated with longitude (beta = 0.45, Delta AICc = 4.23), whereas stomatal row density was negatively correlated (beta = -0.12, Delta AICc = 2.55). These trends may reflect adaptation for differences in moisture availability and altitude between eastern and western populations in Scotland.

#Hybridization in contact zone between temperate European pine species
#Wachowiak, W, Zukowska, WB, Wojkiewicz, B, Cavers, S, Litkowiec, M
#2016
--------------------------------
Hybridization studies are important to advance our understanding of the interspecific gene flow and its evolutionary consequences in closely related species. Hybridization and admixture patterns were assessed in a contact zone and reference populations of European pine species using sequence data from 26 nuclear genes and a species-diagnostic cpDNA marker. Reference populations formed three distinct genetic clusters comprising Pinus sylvestris, Pinus mugo/Pinus uliginosa, and Pinus uncinata. Evidence of population structure was found only in P. uliginosa. Based on phenotypic characteristics and molecular data, we identified five groups of individuals in the contact zone in Poland, comprising forms of the parental species and intermediates that were most probably the result of interspecific crosses. A combination of nuclear gene sequence data and a diagnostic organelle marker were used to show that hybridization is frequent in the contact zone and results in hybrid trees with distinct phenotypic identity. The influence of selection in maintaining hybrid phenotypes in environments unsuited to parental species was inferred from nucleotide polymorphism data. A lack of admixture in reference populations suggests that hybridization has not occurred during post-glacial migration and so the contact zone represents a distinct, active example of ongoing evolution. Pine populations in this zone will be a valuable system for studying the genetic basis of hybrid advantage in environmental conditions untypical of pure parental species.

#Substructuring of Scots pine in Europe based on polymorphism at chloroplast microsatellite loci
#Wojkiewicz, B, Wachowiak, W
#2016
--------------------------------
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) is a forest forming tree species of great ecological and economic importance in the Northern Hemisphere. Assessment of genetic relationships between populations is needed for a better understanding of demographic and evolutionary processes of the species. We analyzed genetic variation and population structure of 24 native populations of Scots pine across its broad European distribution using a set of 13 polymorphic chloroplast simple-sequence repeats loci (cpSSRs). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 11 providing a set of 458 different haplotypes (haplotype diversity, He = 0.982). Genetic differentiation in most between-population comparisons was low (F-ST ranged from 0.00 to 0.08, R-ST ranged from 0.00 to 0.19) as expected for highly outcrossing and wind pollinated tree species. However, Bayesian clustering analysis revealed at least three distinct gehetic clusters corresponding to geographical origin of the analyzed populations. Ourresults indicate genetic substructuring across the distribution range of Scots pine, and also point to the existence of populations of most likely different history that maintain their genetic identity.

#Trace element contamination differentiates the natural population of Scots pine: evidence from DNA microsatellites and needle morphology
#Chudzinska, E, Celinski, K, Pawlaczyk, EM, Wojnicka-Poltorak, A, Diatta, JB
#2016
--------------------------------
The Scots pine is often used in the biomonitoring of forests. Studies on the chemical composition plus variability of its needles morphological structure allow for an assessment of the state of environmental pollution. However, in their natural populations, the response of individual trees to stress differs. This study reports on the influence of long-term soil contamination with trace elements on the morphology of the needles, its possible relation to the differentiation of the genetic pool, and their implications for biomonitoring. In the natural and self-renewable pine stand growing near the point polluter (zinc smelter, Upper Silesia, Poland), two categories of trees are observed with respect to their health status: pollution-tolerant (T) and pollution-sensitive (S). A detailed analysis of the trace element content of the needles reveals that the concentration of Cd, Zn, Pb, and Cu in the needles is significantly higher in S as compared to T individuals. The metal accumulation pattern decidedly follows the sequence Pb > Cd > Cu > Zn. An analysis of the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of the needles reveals that sensitive trees showed an FA index ten times higher in comparison to tolerant ones. Moreover, the high differences between these S and T tree groups are also observed in the basic genetic diversity parameters investigated by an analysis of DNA simple sequence repeats (SSR). The concentration of trace elements in pine needles, distinct in sensitive and tolerant trees and in connection with their morphological and genetic characteristics, may reflect an adaptation process. The level of Mg and Fe content in the needles could be a physiological-toxicological index for evaluating trace element "lethality expressed as Mg and Fe mineral-survival strategies. The example of differences described in this Scots pine population should be taken into consideration in ecotoxicological research to better interpret the obtained results."

#Cross-amplification and multiplexing of cpSSRs and nSSRs in two closely related pine species (Pinus sylvestris L. and P. mugo Turra)
#Zukowska, WB, Wojkiewicz, B, Litkowiec, M, Wachowiak, W
#2017
--------------------------------
Background: Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are widespread molecular markers commonly used in population genetic studies. Nowadays, next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods allow identifying thousands of SSRs in one sequencing run, which greatly facilitates isolation and development of new SSRs. However, their usefulness as molecular markers still must be tested empirically on a number of populations to select SSRs with best parameters for future population genetic research. An alternative approach, cheaper and faster than isolation and characterization of new SSRs, involves cross-amplification of SSRs in closely related species. Aims: Our goal was to develop multiplex PCR protocols that will be useful in population genetic studies of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and dwarf mountain pine (P. mugo Turra), and possibly other pine species. Methods: We tested 14 chloroplast (cpSSRs) and 22 nuclear (nSSRs) microsatellite markers originally designed for Japanese black pine (P. thunbergii Parl.), P. sylvestris and loblolly pine (P. taeda L.) in four populations of P. sylvestris and P. mugo across different locations in Europe. We designed six multiplex PCRs, which were subsequently screened for their ability to provide repeatable and high quality amplification products using capillary electrophoresis. Results: The transfer rate in our study was similar in both pine species, and it was very high for cpSSRs (93% and 86% for P. sylvestris and P. mugo, respectively) and moderate for nSSRs (59% for both species). We managed to design five well-performing multiplex reactions out of six initially tested. Most of the tested loci were polymorphic. Moreover, the allelic patterns detected at some cpSSRs were species-specific. Conclusions: We provide a set of five multiplexes which can be used in genetic studies of both P. sylvestris and P. mugo. Chloroplast marker PCP30277 is a good candidate for a cheap species diagnostic marker suitable for tracking interspecific gene flow between hybridizing species of P. sylvestris and P. mugo.

#Field-based artificial crossings indicate partial compatibility of reciprocal crosses between Pinus sylvestris and Pinus mugo and unexpected chloroplast DNA inheritance
#Kormutak, A, Galgoci, M, Manka, P, Koubova, M, Jopcik, M, Sukenikova, D, Bolecek, P, Gomory, D
#2017
--------------------------------
Crossability relationships between Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and mountain dwarf pine (Pinus mugo Turra) was studied, using artificial pollination approach. Partial compatibility of the reciprocal crossings of these species was proved experimentally, validating the idea of a spontaneous formation of their hybrid swarms under natural conditions. The hybrids were validated using organellar DNA markers and nuclear DNA microsatellites. Based on the percentage of filled seeds, the interspecific crossings were less efficient than the intraspecific cross-pollinations of P. sylvestris and P. mugo individuals. Both species were found to intercross readily with individuals of their putative hybrid swarm, P. mugo exhibiting a higher hybridological affinity towards putatively hybrid individuals than P. sylvestris. Validation of the hybrids confirmed the paternal inheritance of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) in the combination P. sylvestris x P. mugo only. Surprisingly, in the reciprocal crossing P. mugo x P. sylvestris, maternal inheritance of cpDNA was revealed. Obtained results offer a new insight into the direction and intensity of gene flow within the hybrid swarms of Scots pine and mountain dwarf pine.

#Genogeography of Pinus sylvestris L. populations in the Greater Caucasus and Crimea
#Petrova, IV, Sannikov, SN, Tembotova, FI, Sannikova, NS, Farzaliev, VS, Mollaeva, MZ, Egorov, EV
#2017
--------------------------------
Allozyme analysis of 18 Pinus sylvestris L. populations from seven landscape-geographic groups has been performed in the Greater Caucasus, Crimea, and Russian Plain. The results show that populations of the Mt. Elbrus region (isolated by high mountain ridges) are characterized by lower polymorphism and most distinct differentiation (at the level of geographic race) from other populations, which are differentiated from each other at the level of geographic groups. Genetic gradients (boundaries) between populations reach a maximum on transects across the Greater Caucasus Range, and Transcaucasian populations are more similar to populations of the Russian Plain, compared to North Caucasian populations, which confirms the hypothesis of ancestral connections between their gene pools.

#Reconstructing the plant mitochondrial genome for marker discovery: a case study using Pinus
#Donnelly, K, Cottrell, J, Ennos, RA, Vendramin, GG, A'Hara, S, King, S, Perry, A, Wachowiak, W, Cavers, S
#2017
--------------------------------
Whole-genome-shotgun (WGS) sequencing of total genomic DNA was used to recover similar to 1 Mbp of novel mitochondrial (mtDNA) sequence from Pinus sylvestris (L.) and three members of the closely related Pinus mugo species complex. DNA was extracted from megagametophyte tissue from six mother trees from locations across Europe, and 100-bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Candidate mtDNA sequences were identified by their size and coverage characteristics, and by comparison with published plant mitochondrial genomes. Novel variants were identified, and primers targeting these loci were trialled on a set of 28 individuals from across Europe. In total, 31 SNP loci were successfully resequenced, characterizing 15 unique haplotypes. This approach offers a cost-effective means of developing marker resources for mitochondrial genomes in other plant species where reference sequences are unavailable.

#Substantial variation in the timing of pollen production reduces reproductive synchrony between distant populations of Pinus sylvestris L. in Scotland
#Whittet, R, Cavers, S, Cottrell, J, Rosique-Esplugas, C, Ennos, R
#2017
--------------------------------
The ability of a population to genetically adapt to a changing environment is contingent not only on the level of existing genetic variation within that population, but also on the gene flow received from differently adapted populations. Effective pollen-mediated gene flow among plant populations requires synchrony of flowering. Therefore differences in timing of flowering among genetically divergent populations may reduce their ability to adapt to environmental change. To determine whether gene flow among differently adapted populations of native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Scotland was restricted by differences in their flowering phenology, we measured timing of pollen release among populations spanning a steep environmental gradient over three consecutive seasons (2014-2016). Results showed that, over a distance of 137km, there were as many as 15.8days' difference among populations for the predicted timing of peak pollen shedding, with the earliest development in the warmer west of the country. There was much variation between years, with the earliest development and least synchrony in the warmest year (2014) and latest development and greatest synchrony in the coolest year (2015). Timing was negatively correlated with results from a common-garden experiment, indicative of a pattern of countergradient variation. We conclude that the observed differences in reproductive synchrony were sufficient to limit gene flow via pollen between populations of P.sylvestris at opposite ends of the environmental gradient across Scotland. We also hypothesize that continually warming, or asymmetrically warming spring temperatures will decrease reproductive synchrony among pine populations.

#Cryptic genetic variation and adaptation to waterlogging in Caledonian Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris L.
#Donnelly, K, Cavers, S, Cottrell, JE, Ennos, RA
#2018
--------------------------------
Local adaptation occurs as the result of differential selection among populations. Observations made under common environmental conditions may reveal phenotypic differences between populations with an underlying genetic basis; however, exposure to a contrasting novel environment can trigger release of otherwise unobservable (cryptic) genetic variation. We conducted a waterlogging experiment on a common garden trial of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris (L.), saplings originating from across a steep rainfall gradient in Scotland. A flood treatment was maintained for approximately 1year; physiological responses were gauged periodically in terms of photochemical capacity as measured via chlorophyll fluorescence. During the treatment, flooded individuals experienced a reduction in photochemical capacity, F-v/F-m, this reduction being greater for material originating from drier, eastern sites. Phenotypic variance was increased under flooding, and this increase was notably smaller in saplings originating from western sites where precipitation is substantially greater and waterlogging is more common. We conclude that local adaptation has occurred with respect to waterlogging tolerance and that, under the flooding treatment, the greater increase in variability observed in populations originating from drier sites is likely to reflect a relative absence of past selection. In view of a changing climate, we note that comparatively maladapted populations may possess considerable adaptive potential, due to cryptic genetic variation, that should not be overlooked.

#Maternal inheritance of chloroplast DNA in Pinus mugo Turra: a case study of Pinus mugo x Pinus sylvestris crossing
#Kormutak, A, Galgoci, M, Sukenikova, D, Bolecek, P, Libantova, J, Gomory, D
#2018
--------------------------------
The opposite modes of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) inheritance were found to operate in the reciprocal crossings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and mountain dwarf pine (Pinus mugo Turra). The crossings were found to be partially compatible. In P. sylvestris x P. mugo crossing, the paternal transmission of cpDNA to the offspring takes place corroborating the generally acknowledged concept of the paternal cpDNA inheritance in gymnosperms. On the contrary, in P. mugo x P. sylvestris crossing the seed progeny exhibited P. mugo haplotype of the mother tree deviating conspicuously from the above concept. In the open pollination offspring of the putatively hybrid individuals of the Scots and mountain dwarf pines, a biparental inheritance of cpDNA was revealed in mother tree with P. mugo haplotype indicating a loosened control of the maternal inheritance of cpDNA in the putative hybrids. Implications and impacts of this finding for further studies are discussed.

#Weak isolation by distance and geographic diversity gradients persist in Scottish relict pine forest
#Gonzalez-Diaz, P, Cavers, S, Iason, GR, Booth, A, Russell, J, Jump, AS
#2018
--------------------------------
Gene flow is one of the main factors shaping genetic diversity within and among tree populations, and occurs through pollen and seed dispersal. Recent findings of pollen-release asynchronies in distant populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) within Scotland suggest that gene dispersal among more distant populations might be less effective than previously thought. Limited gene dispersal is one of the major factors causing genetic structure for neutral markers, and pollen-release asynchrony could have driven isolation by distance (IBD) among Scottish populations. Previous studies of neutral markers found little differentiation among Scottish populations of Scots pine, however they did not consider IBD over the full Scottish range. We analysed data from 6 nuclear simple sequence repeats (SSR) and 5 chloroplast SSR loci in a total of 540 individuals of Scots pine from 18 populations across Scotland. Our aim was to assess contemporary levels and distribution of genetic variation and to test if the distribution of genetic diversity was consistent with IBD. We also analysed patterns of gene flow that could have contributed to the observed patterns of variation. Levels of genetic diversity were high, for both nuclear and chloroplast markers within populations, and there was no significant differentiation among populations. A weak signal of IBD was present. We found an increase in nuclear diversity towards the East along with greater gene flow in a West-East direction commensurate with the prevailing winds. Our findings suggest that this wind-driven gene flow is dominant over genetic drift and prevents differentiation among the Scottish populations. It may also counteract any pollen-release asynchronies among populations.

#Current Approaches and Perspectives in Population Genetics of Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
#Wojkiewicz, B, Cavers, S, Wachowiak, W
#2016
--------------------------------
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is one of the most ecologically and economically important forest-forming tree species in the Northern Hemisphere. Because of value, numerous genetic studies have been conducted since the 19th century to develop or improve the breeding and conservation programs of the species. Current studies are motivated by growing concerns about the survival and productivity of Scots pine populations, especially in the face of long-term environmental change predictions. In this article, we review major questions in the population genetics of Scots pine and show how previous studies advance current research approaches. We refer to major outcomes of the research describing the genetic variation and postglacial history of Scots pine compared with those of other cold-tolerant tree species such as Norway spruce (Picea abies) and silver birch (Betula pendula). We present results from studies of quantitative trait variation and local adaptation across the Scots pine distribution. We focus on the main research directions in dissection of the genetic basis of adaptive traits and the search for signatures of selection using quantitative trait locus mapping, candidate genes, association genetics, and genome scanning approaches. Finally, we highlight novel approaches in molecular breeding and point out new research prospects in genomic studies of Scots pine and other forest tree species in the face of rapid developments in next-generation sequencing and genoiyping methods.

#Genetic Diversity among Age Classes of a Pinus sylvestris (L.) Population from the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland
#Wojnicka-Poltorak, A, Celinski, K, Chudzinska, E
#2017
--------------------------------
The Bialowieza Primeval Forest (BPF) is Europe's last primeval forest and an irreplaceable area for biodiversity conservation due to its size, protection status, and substantially undisturbed nature. There is no other forest in Europe with such a large surface representing highly-advanced natural succession. This article reports on the first analysis of the genetic variability and demographic structure of a self-renewed Pinus sylvestris population located in BPF, using both chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA markers. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) for chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSRs) revealed a significant genetic differentiation among age classes that accounted for about 2% of the total variance, comparable to those reported among different populations of Scots pine. None of the 117 detected chloroplast haplotypes were common to all age classes. Haplotype diversity ranged from 0.370 to 0.415 for cpSSRs and from 0.320 to 0.455 for mitochondrial markers. The genetic variation of the studied age classes-represented by mitochondrial markers-strongly depicts the maternal genetic structure, indicating limited seed dispersal. Temporal genetic substructuring is maintained within a self-renewed population of Scots pine from the BPF.

#Genetic Diversity and Its Spatial Distribution in Self-Regenerating Norway Spruce and Scots Pine Stands
#Verbylaite, R, Pliura, A, Lygis, V, Suchockas, V, Jankauskiene, J, Labokas, J
#2017
--------------------------------
Tree genetic diversity is among the most important factors determining the sustainability of forest ecosystems. The main aim of the present study was to track possible changes in genetic diversity of regenerating populations of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in areas subjected either to a natural disturbance (windthrows and subsequent clear-cutting of the affected spruce stand) or to a changed land-use legacy (pine regeneration on abandoned agricultural land) with the aim of testing whether the new forest generation retains the genetic diversity of the putative maternal stand. Eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to reveal the genetic diversity and its spatial distribution in the studied tree populations. Self-regenerating juveniles of Norway spruce and Scots pine were spatially random and as genetically diverse as in the putative maternal populations. Genetic differentiation between putatively maternal trees and regenerating juveniles was low for both species. A high genetic diversity and random spatial genetic structure revealed in the regenerating populations provides a basis for the formation of evolutionary and ecologically sound stands able to adapt to ever-changing climatic conditions. Information on the genetic dynamics of the studied natural populations of long-lived coniferous tree species may be important for evaluating possible changes in genetic diversity at a local scale following forest ecosystem disturbances and changes in land-use legacies.

--------------------------------
Due to their maternal mode of inheritance, mitochondrial markers can be regarded as almost ‘ideal’ tools in evolutionary studies of conifer populations. In the present study, polymorphism was analysed at one mitochondrial intron ( nad 1, exon B/C) in 23 native European Pinus sylvestris populations. In a preliminary screening for variation using a polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism approach, two length variants were identified. By fully sequencing the 2.5 kb region, the observed length polymorphism was found to result from the insertion of a 31 bp sequence, with no other mutations observed within the intron. A set of primers was designed flanking the observed mutation, which identified a novel sequence-tagged-site mitochondrial marker for P. sylvestris . Analysis of 747 trees from the 23 populations using these primers revealed the occurrence of two distinct haplotypes in Europe. Within the Iberian Peninsula, the two haplotypes exhibited extensive population differentiation ( F ST = 0.59; P £ 0.001) and a marked geographical structuring. In the populations of central and northern Europe, one haplotype largely predominated, with the second being found in only one individual of one population.

#1998
--------------------------------
Changes in forestry policy have increased the importance and extended the scope of genetic management of native species. Recent debate on genetic management prescriptions has been conducted with insufficient access to sound scientific information. This paper attempts to remedy this by: (1) presenting an overview of genetic variation and the processes which control it; (2) reviewing current measures; and (3) proposing a range of improvements ti, policy and practice. Genetic variation in Scottish tree and shrub populations is a neglected field of research, except for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Some useful information can be provided by considering the history, ecology and biology of species together with genetic theory. Current patterns of variation reflect both the historical origins (as demonstrated by biochemical markers) and adaptation through natural selection (as indicated by provenance research). Existing populations probably still retain significant elements of adaptive variation; though this will vary according to species, with some showing close correlation between patterns of adaptive variation and environmental factors and others being more plastic. Indigenous genepools have been modified by fragmentation, changes in the forest environment, and introduction of foreign material, much of which is maladapted to upland sites. With some exceptions, the levels of genetic variation in existing indigenous populations comprise an adequate basis for restoring and expanding native woodland. The current undiscriminating use of continental provenances needs to be strongly discouraged; but equally restricting choice of seed sources to the most local provenances can also be inappropriate. Use of Scottish material from the same region and similar site type as the planting site needs to be encouraged. Current genetic management measures are rudimentary and fail to address adequately key issues of provenance choice, genetic conservation, seed supply or provision of selected or improved material, especially in broadleaves. Changes in legislation, regulation, seed supply, advice and research are proposed to address these shortcomings. The need for more provenance research is highlighted.

#Gene-pool variation in Caledonian and European Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) revealed by chloroplast simple-sequence repeats.
#Provan, J, Soranzo, N, Wilson, NJ, et al
#1998
--------------------------------
We have used polymorphic chloroplast simple-sequence repeats to analyse levels of genetic variation within and between seven native Scottish and eight mainland European populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Diversity levels for the Scottish populations based on haplotype frequency were far in excess of those previously obtained using monoterpenes and isozymes and confirmed lower levels of genetic variation within the derelict population at Glen Falloch. The diversity levels were higher than those reported in similar studies in other Pinus species. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that small (3.24-8.81%) but significant (P less than or equal to 0.001) portions of the variation existed between the populations and that there was no significant difference between the Scottish and the mainland European populations. Evidence of population substructure was found in the Rannoch population, which exhibited two subgroups. Finally, one of the loci studied exhibited an allele distribution uncharacteristic of the stepwise mutation model of evolution of simple-sequence repeats, and sequencing of the PCR products revealed that this was due to a duplication rather than slippage in the repeat region. An examination of the distribution of this mutation suggests that it, may have occurred fairly recently in the Wester Ross region or that it may be evidence of a refugial population.

--------------------------------
Aim To understand the impact of glacial refugia and migration pathways on the modern genetic diversity of Pinus sylvestris. Location The study was carried out throughout Europe. Methods An extended set of data of pollen and macrofossil remains was used to locate the glacial refugia and reconstruct the migrating routes of P. sylvestris throughout Europe. A vegetation model was used to simulate the extent of the potential refugia during the last glacial period. At the same time a genetic survey was carried out on this species. Results The simulated distribution of P. sylvestris during the last glacial period is coherent with the observed fossil data, which showed a patchy distribution of the refugia between c. 40 degrees N and 50 degrees N. Several migrational fronts were detected within the Iberian and the Italian peninsulas, and outside the Hungarian plain and around the Alps. The modern mitochondrial DNA depicted three different haplotypes for P. sylvestris. Two distinct haplotypes were restricted to northern Spain and Italy, and the third haplotype dominated most of the present-day remaining distribution range of P. sylvestris in Europe. Main concluions During the last glacial period P. sylvestris was constrained under severe climatic conditions to survive in scattered and restricted refugial areas. Combining palaeoenvironmental data, vegetation modelling and the genetic data, we have shown that the long-term isolation in the glacial refugia and the migrational process during the Holocene have played a major role in shaping the modern genetic diversity of P. sylvestris in Europe.

#A comparison between European and British provenances of some British native trees: growth, survival and stem form.
#Worrell, R
#1992
--------------------------------
Data describing the growth, survival and stem form of: a) European continental, and b) British provenances of trees native to Britain were collated from Forestry Commission records. The growth rates of European continental provenances of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), silver birch (Betula pendula), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and common alder (Alnus glutinosa) were inferior to those of British provenances in 90 per cent of cases. European provenances of these species also showed inferior survival. The growth rates of continental provenances of beech (Fagus sylvatica) were superior to British provenances in about 50 per cent of cases, provenances from northern France, Belgium and Holland being the fastest growing. Relationships between the relative height growth of foreign provenances and latitude were demonstrated for Scots pine, silver birch and beech (relative height growth = the height growth of a foreign provenance expressed relative to that of British provenances at the same site). The continental provenances that grew best originated at 0-4-degrees-south of the latitudes of the planting sites. Relative height growth decreased both north and south of these latitudes. In the case of oak, relative height growth did not vary widely between origins. The survival of continental provenances of Scots pine was particularly poor on exposed upland sites. The stem form of British provenances of Scots pine was intermediate between Fennoscandian provenances and provenances from the rest of Europe. In oak and beech there was generally little difference in stem form between British and continental provenances, but the best continental provenances (Belgian beech; French oak) were most reliable. The growth and survival of native trees is interpreted in the light of the post-glacial history of these species. The implications regarding the continued use of seed of native hardwoods imported from continental Europe are discussed.

#Do molecular markers reflect patterns of differentiation in adaptive traits of conifers?.
#Karhu, A, Hurme, P, Karjalainen, M, Karvonen, P, Karkkainen, K, Neale, D, Savolainen, O
#1996
--------------------------------
We have examined patterns of variation of several kinds of molecular markers (isozymes, RFLPs of ribosomal DNA and anonymous low-copy number DNA, RAPDs and microsatellites) and an adaptive trait [date of bud set in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)]. The study included Finnish Scots pine populations (from latitude 60 degrees N to 70 degrees N) which experience a steep climatic gradient. Common garden experiments show that these populations are adapted to the location of their origin and genetically differentiated in adaptive quantitative traits, e.g. the date of bud set in first-year seedlings. In the northernmost population, bud set took place about 21 days earlier than in the southernmost population. Of the total variation in bud set, 36.4% was found among the populations. All molecular markers showed high levels of within-population variation, while differentiation among populations was low. Among all the studied markers, microsatellites were the most variable ((H) over bar(e)=0.77). Differences between populations were small, G(ST) was less than 0.02. Our study suggests that molecular markers may be poor predictors of the population differentiation of quantitative traits in Scots pine, as exemplified here by bud-set date.

#Genetic variation in Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L) under industrial pollution in the southern Urals: Mutagenesis.
#Bakhtiyarova, RM
#1997
--------------------------------
Mutant isozymes, revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were studied in three Scotch pine populations. Two populations were located in regions strongly contaminated by industrial air pollutants. The third population was a control and occupied an uncontaminated region. It was shown that the rate of spontaneous mutagenesis increased under industrial stress. Total frequencies of mutations and mutation- like events per locus calculated for three groups of abnormal isozymes were 7.2 x 10(-4) and 4.60 x 10(-3) in populations under industrial pollution and 1.6 x 10(-4) in the control.

Most indices used to analyze samples grown hear a magnesium plant and copper works in Chelyabinskaya oblast showed that genetic variation was higher in less damaged trees.

#Isozyme gene loci and their allelic variation in Pinus sylvestris L and Pinus cembra L.
#Bergmann, F, Hattemer, HH
#1995
--------------------------------
The genetic structure and variation of 5 Scots pine (P. sylvestris L.) and 4 Swiss stone pine (P. cembra L.) populations was compared using allele frequency data from the same isozyme-gene-systems. Differences between the 2 pine species belonging to the subgenera Pinus and Strobus, respectively, concern both the number of controlling gene loci and the number and frequency of alleles. Although Scots pine is characterized by larger populations and a wider natural range than Swiss stone pine, the genetic diversity values did not generally differ to a similar degree or in the direction expected. While Scots pine possesses higher diversity at several enzyme loci, Swiss stone pine reaches the same degree of diversity or even a higher degree at other loci. Interestingly, the greatest differences in gene diversity between the 2 pine species were detected for isozyme-gene- systems that differ in the number of controlling loci, suggesting that variable allozymes at only 1 (or 2) loci and invariant isozymes at multiple loci are alternate forms of enzyme adaptation in the 2 species. The relationship between such adaptive strategies at the enzyme level and the ecological conditions and life history traits of the 2 species are discussed.

#The mating system in a scots pine clonal seed orchard in Poland.
#Burczyk, J
#1991
--------------------------------
The mating system of a clonal seed orchard of Pinus sylvestris L consisting of 32 clones was studied using allozyme marker loci.  Single-locus estimates of outcrossing rate ranged from 0.907-1.106 (with a mean of 1.011), while the multilocus estimate was 0.987.  The outcrossing rates of individual trees ranged from 0.840-1.208.  The variance effective population size estimated for males was equivalent to 14 individuals. Some patterns of non-random mating were found.  The level of inbreeding as measured by average fixation indices was low, both in the parental and the filial generations.  The usefulness of Scots pine seed orchards in forest tree improvement has been discussed in the light of genetic efficiency.

#Mating system variation in a Scots pine clonal seed orchard.
#Burczyk, J
#1998
--------------------------------
The mating system was investigated in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seed orchard consisting of 32 clones, using 10 isozyme loci as genetic markers. The multilocus outcrossing rate calculated for the data pooled over three years of observations was estimated to be 0.987 (0.005). The population multilocus estimates of three consecutive years exhibited a decreasing trend (0.976, 0.966 and 0.962 for the years 1988 to 1990, respectively), but this variation was not significant. Individual outcrossing rates were homogeneous across years for most sampled ramets. Individual tree estimates were heterogeneous across sampled ramets for the pooled data in the years 1988 and 1990 but not for 1989. Individual outcrossing rates were not significantly related to individual pollen production. Although no significant variation of outcrossing rates in time could be detected, estimates of valiance effective population size in the three years suggest temporal variation in outcross mating patterns.

#Genetic differentiation of adjacent populations of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. from different ecotopes.
#Dvornik, VY, Kotov, VS, Mikheenko, IP
#1998
--------------------------------
The genetic structure of two adjacent populations of Scots pine from different ecotopes at a small gradient of ecological changes was studied at 22 loci by allozyme analysis using electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. The significant difference between some characteristics of genetic variability (A, P-95 and P-99, and h(mu)) closely related to the proportion of rare alleles in a gene pool of populations was established, whereas heterozygosity and Wright's fixation index were only slightly different. The genetic distance calculated at 19 polymorphic loci was 0.017, which is more than two times higher than that presented in the literature for neighboring populations. The data obtained indicate that even a slight gradient of natural ecological changes leads to the appearance of a genetic barrier between adjacent populations of Pinus sylvestris L.

#Genetic variability and differentiation of geographically marginal Scots pine populations from Ukraine.
#Dvornyk, V
#2001
--------------------------------
Genetic variability of six geographically marginal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations from Ukraine situated mainly on a longitudinal gradient was studied using allozymes and vertical PAGE technique. The populations have average observed heterozygosity H-o=0.262, and expected heterozygosity H- e=0.281. The mean value of NEI's genetic distance was 0.016, and F-ST was 0.020, similar to the values reported for Scots pine populations from other parts of the range. The obtained values of NEI's genetic distances (0.004 to 0.026) suggest that southern geographically marginal populations of Scots pine are as much differentiated as the central populations and have probably slightly higher level of differentiation than the northern-most populations.

#1992
--------------------------------
Pinus sylvestris and P. mugo populations from Poland and Czechoslovakia were compared using genetic variability at isozyme markers, chloroplast DNA variation, and mating system measurements. Two isozyme loci were found to differ between the species. P. mugo was as variable at isozyme loci as P. sylvestris. Diagnostic cpDNA fragments were found using the restriction enzyme Bcl-I. Populations that were morphologically classified as hybrids were found to be pure species, based both on isozyme and cpDNA results.

#Goncharenko, GG, Silin, AE, Padutov, VE
#1994
--------------------------------
Eighteen natural populations of Pinus sylvestris L. were investigated by starch-gel electrophoresis. A total of 88 alleles were observed at 21 loci. More than 90 % of the loci in P. sylvestris were polymorphic and the mean observed and expected heterozygosity values were 0.282 and 0.286, respectively. Interpopulation genetic diversity was about 3 % of the total genetic diversity and the level of gene flow was 8.68. NEI's genetic distance coefficient ranged from 0.005 to 0.046 among populations and averaged 0.017. From the dendrogram it can be seen that clustering did not reflect geographical proximity. The data also show that P. cretacea, which occurs on ancient carbonate rock outcrops, can be regarded simply as a race of P. sylvestris. On the whole, our results demonstrate that sufficient genetic variation exists in P. sylvestris to explain its great ecological plasticity and evolutionary potential. Estimated parameters of gene diversity, genetic distance and gene flow show that the P. sylvestris populations we studied share a common gene pool.

--------------------------------
Linkage between the self-fertility level and genotype for 10 allozyme loci in Pinus sylvestris was investigated. A positive correlation of self-fertility with homozygosity between the three loci Dia, Got-B, and Got-C was found. In addition, homozygotes for the fast allele of the glutamate dehydrogenase locus Gdh were shown to possess a lower self-fertility level than other genotypes. It is assumed that these allozyme the loci are linked with loci responsible for preventing self-pollination.

#Rapid expansion of microsatellite sequences in pines.
#Karhu, A, Dieterich, JH, Savolainen, O
#2000
--------------------------------
Microsatellite persistence time and evolutionary change was studied among five species of pines, which included a pair of closely related species (Pinus sylvestris and Pinus resinosa) in the subgenus Pious, their relative Pinus radiata, and another closely related species pair (Pinus strobus and Pinus lambertiana) in the subgenus Strobus. The effective population sizes of these species are known to have ranged from the very small bottlenecks of P. resinosa to vast populations of P. sylvestris. This background allowed us to place the microsatellite evolution in a well-defined phylogenetic setting. Of 30 loci originating from P. strobus and P. radiata, we were able to consistently amplify 4 in most of the these pine species. These priming sites had been conserved for over 100 Myr. The four microsatellites were sequenced in the five species. Flanking sequences were compared to establish that the loci were orthologous. All microsatellites had persisted in these species, despite very different population sizes. We found a recent microsatellite duplication: a closely related pair of loci in P. strobus, where the other four species had just one locus. On two independent occasions, the repeat area of this same microsatellite (locus RPS 105a/b) had grown from a very low repeat number to 15 or 17 in the last 10-25 Myr. Other parts of the same compound microsatellite had remained virtually unchanged. Locus PR 4.6 is known to be polymorphic in both P. radiata and P. sylvestris, but the polymorphism in the two species is due to different motifs. The very large pine genomes are highly repetitive, and microsatellite loci also occur as gene families.

#The chloroplast genome of Pinus sylvestris - physical map and localization of chloroplast genes.

#1993
--------------------------------
A physical map of Pinus sylvestris L. chloroplast DNA for three restriction endonucleases (PstI, SacI, and KpnI) has been prepared by hybridization of isolated or cloned restriction fragments. Pinus sylvestris chloroplast DNA is about 120 kilobases. Ten chloroplast genes have been localized by hybridization with heterologous chloroplast DNA probes. The genome contains single copies of the 23S and 16S rRNA genes and lacks any large repeated sequences. The restriction site arrangement and gene order have been compared with other known chloroplast DNA genetic maps of pine species.

#Komulainen, P, Brown, GR, Mikkonen, M, Karhu, A, Garcia-Gil, MR, O'Malley, D, Lee, B, Neale, DB, Savolainen, O
#2003
--------------------------------
A genetic map of Pinus sylvestris was constructed using ESTP (expressed sequence tag polymorphism) markers and other gene- based markers, AFLP markers and microsatellites. Part of the ESTP markers (40) were developed and mapped earlier in Pinus taeda, and additional markers were generated based on P. sylvestris sequences or sequences from other pine species. The mapping in P. sylvestris was based on 94 F-1 progeny from a cross between plus-tree parents E635C and E1101. AFLP framework maps for the parent trees were first constructed. The ESTP and other gene sequence-based markers were added to the framework maps, as well as five published microsatellite loci. The separate maps were then integrated with the aid of AFLPs segregating in both trees (dominant segregation ratios 3:1) as well as gene markers and microsatellites segregating in both parent trees (segregation ratios 1:1:1:1 or 1:2:1). The integrated map consisted of 12 groups corresponding to the P. taeda linkage groups, and additionally three and six smaller groups for E1101 and E635C, respectively. The number of framework AFLP markers in the integrated map is altogether 194 and the number of gene markers 61. The total length of the integrated map was 1,314 cM. The set of markers developed for P. sylvestris was also added to existing maps of two P. taeda pedigrees. Starting with a mapped marker from one pedigree in the source species resulted in a mapped marker in a pedigree of the other species in more than 40% of the cases, with about equal success in both directions. The maps of the two species are largely colinear, even if the species have diverged more than 70 MYA. Most cases of different locations were probably due to problems in identifying the orthologous members of gene families. These data provide a first ESTP-containing map of P. sylvestris, which can also be used for comparing this species to additional species mapped with the same markers.

#Genetic structure and variation in Pinus sylvestris L. populations degrading due to pollution-induced injury.
#Korshikov, II, Velikoridko, TI, Butilskaya, LA
#2002
--------------------------------
The comparative study of genetic variation and differentiation of Ukraine's south-eastern five marginal Pinus sylvestris L. populations (which are differently damaged by emissions of large chemical enterprises producing mineral fertilizers, plastics and organic dyes and are degrading through it) was performed using the electrophoretic analysis of 9 gene-enzymous systems, encoded by 22 loci. About 82% of P. sylvestris genes have been found to be in a polymorphic state and each tree is on the average heterozygous in 22.3% of its genes. In the most degrading population which is 0.3 km from the main provenances of air pollutants mean indices of genetic polymorphism were lower, a number of alleles per a locus - by 18%, genotypes - by 13%, observed heterozygosity - by 12% and expected one - by 9% compared to the far removed population (more than 100 km). Those mean indices in two damaged-degrading populations were also by 7.9% to 16.7% lower than in three populations of the background and not polluted zone. The populations under consideration are weakly differentiated, NEI'S genetic distance coefficient varied within 0.004 to 0.014, accounting at an average for 0.008. For the population degrading due to the untimely elimination of trees, damaged by pollutants, the values of these coefficients compared with the rest four populations did not exceed the average level.

#Microsatellite sequences in Pinus sylvestris.
#Kostia, S, Varvio, SL, Vakkari, P, Pulkkinen, P
#1995
--------------------------------
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) genomic libraries were constructed and screened with oligonucleotide probes (GT)(10),(CT)(10), and (AT)(10). Eight microsatellites were identified from 6000 clones screened. The longest microsatellite stretch found (GT)(9)(N)(21)(AT)(24), was amplified from bud and single pollen grain samples. In order to clarify the complex amplification pattern revealed, two PCR products were sequenced. The size differences were caused both by varying repeat numbers of the microsatellite stretches and by differences in other parts of the amplified sequence. This kind of complex molecular basis of microsatellite amplification within a species has not been previously reported. Microsatellite sequences were used as PCR primers to detect polymorphisms and to estimate the abundance of microsatellites.

#1997
--------------------------------
A spectrum of peroxidase isozymes and allozyme variability at two polymorphic loci Per-3 and Per-5 were studied in needles of Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) by means of disc electrophoresis in vertical polyacrylamide gel slabs. Among the sample analyzed (n = 282), levels of observed (Ho) and expected (He) mean heterozygosities at both loci were 0.120 and 0.152, respectively. A significant deficit of heterozygotes at the Per-3 locus was observed.

#Properties of AFLP markers in inheritance and genetic diversity studies of Pinus sylvestris L..
#Lerceteau, E, Szmidt, AE
#1999
--------------------------------
We analysed the properties of AFLP markers in Pinus sylvestris. Using primers with three selective nucleotides, the AFLP protocol produced large numbers of amplified bands and could only be used with a restricted number of primer combinations. Replacement of the EcoRI + 3 primer by an EcoRI + 4 primer halved the number of bands, facilitating analysis. The inheritance of all but about 8.4% of the amplified bands has been confirmed to be Mendelian. We compared band patterns among selected P. sylvestris trees from northern Sweden, two Asian species of Pinus and one species from the genus Picea. The dendrogram obtained was generally concordant with the taxonomic data, although the genetic similarity values between trees from different genera did not entirely follow accepted inter- and intraspecific relationships. This deviation was less pronounced using primer combinations that generated fewer bands. More than 69.1% of the bands that were polymorphic in two P. sylvestris trees or 29 of their F-1 progeny were in a pseudo-testcross configuration and thus were useful for the development of a linkage map for each parent. These markers have been analysed in four other crosses, and 83% of the bands could be mapped in at least one cross. Depending on the level of heterozygosity of the parents, the efficiency of such mapping will vary, but the AFLP technique appears to be a powerful way to generate, very quickly, large numbers of markers that are useful for constructing and comparing linkage maps.

#Allozyme investigations on the genetic differentiation between closely related pines - Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, and P. uliginosa (Pinaceae).
#Lewandowski, A, Boratynski, A, Mejnartowicz, L
#2000
--------------------------------
In eight natural European populations of four closely related taxa of pines (Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, and P. uliginosa) starch-gel electrophoreses revealed altogether 58 alleles at 15 loci from nine enzyme systems. With Nei's genetic distance (D) the largest mean genetic distance (D = 0.171) was found between P. sylvestris and P. mugo, a distance corresponding to that between other closely related pine species. Mean genetic distances between the other taxa were less than half that value and characteristic for subspecies or varieties rather than for species. On the basis of our results we suggest that both, P. uliginosa and P. uncinata, could be the result of the ancient hybridization between P, sylvestris and P. mugo.

#The mating system outcrossing rate and genetic differentiation in natural Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations from Bulgaria.
#Longauer, R, Zhelev, P, Paule, L, Gomory, D
#1992
--------------------------------
Mating system and outcrossing rates were investigated in two Scots pine populations from the Rodopi mountains, Bulgaria (850 m or 1750 m a. s. l., respectively).  The multilocus outcrossing rates were 0.986 +/- 0.029 and 0.934 +/- 0.023, while the mean observed heterozygosities (H(o)) based on 9 investigated loci were 0.459 and 0.396 and the fixation indices were 0.125 and 0.071.  The differentiation between 6 populations based on allelic frequencies is low and no significant differences between populations (except GOT-C) were found.

#Neetsarqueda, C
#1994
--------------------------------
Electrophoretic allozyme differentiation at 11 loci was studied in Pinus sylvestris and Pinus mugo aggr. populations, as well as in 3 populations containing individuals with intermediate morphology between P. sylvestris and P. uncinata. The 14 populations sampled from different geographical areas of Switzerland are clustered in 2 main groups, a P. sylvestris and a P. uncicata group, which confirms the taxonomic status of these 2 species. Morphologically intermediate populations are grouped with P. sylvestris and there is no evidence for an introgressive hybrid zone hypothesis. A comparative analysis of discriminant scores obtained for intermediate form individuals using both morphological and genetic data clearly confirms the presence of both species in the intermediate form populations which are thus mixed stands of P. sylvestris and P. uncinata.

Seeds from open pollination of individual female stroboli on different days in June 1990 in a coastal clone archive of Pinus sylvestris (L.) in northern Sweden (latitude 63-degrees 39' N) were used for a short-term progeny experiment to study differences over time in the genetic composition of the background pollen.  Analysis of progeny growth and cold acclimatization in artificial whole-plant freezing tests suggested no genetic differences in the fertilizing pollen between pollination days.  A clinal variation with the latitude of pollen origin was observed for reference progenies from fertilization with pollen of known geographical origin. Comparisons between open-pollinated progenies and reference progenies indicate that the pollen cloud originated from approximately 1-degree latitude (based on height growth) or 1.5-degree latitude (based on freezing injury) north of the pollination site.

#Identification and characterization of RAPD markers inferring genetic relationships among Pine species.
#Nkongolo, KK, Michael, P, Gratton, WW
#2002
--------------------------------
Total genomic DNAs were extracted from several populations of pine species and amplified using oligonucleotides of random sequences. Polymorphism in random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers was high and sufficient in distinguishing each of the species. Genetic relationships among eight pine species (Pinus sylvestris, Pinus strobus, Pinus rigida, Pinus resinosa, Pinus nigra, Pinus contorta, Pinus monticola, and Pinus banksiana) from different provenances were analyzed. The degree of band sharing was used to evaluate genetic distance between species and to construct a phylogenetic tree. In general, the dendrogram corroborated the description of relationships based on morphological characteristics and crossability, but also provided new insights into pine taxonomy. RAPD markers specific to some pine species were cloned and sequenced. PCR amplifications using pairs of designed specific primers revealed that all the cloned sequences were likely genus specific because they were not found in spruce or larch. True species-specific sequences were identified using designed primers flanking cloned RAPD fragments. The analysis of RAPD fragment sequences confirmed the genetic relationships among species. A 2281-bp RAPD band called PI-Mt-Stb-23 from P. strobus was used as a probe in restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and produced distinct banding patterns for each species examined, consistent with the highly polymorphic character of DNA-fingerprinting probes.

#Polymorphic simple sequence repeat regions in chloroplast genomes - applications to the population genetics of pines.
#Powell, W, Morgante, M, Mcdevitt, R, Vendramin, GG, Rafalski, JA
#1995
--------------------------------
Simple sequence repeats (SSRs), consisting of tandemly repeated multiple copies of mono-, di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide motifs, are ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes and are frequently used as genetic markers, taking advantage of their length polymorphism, We have examined the polymorphism of such sequences in the chloroplast genomes of plants, by using a PCR-based assay, GenBank searches identified the presence of several (dA)(n) .(dT)(n) mononucleotide stretches in chloroplast genomes, A chloroplast (cp) SSR was identified in three pine species (Pinus contorta, Pinus sylvestris, and Finns thunbergii) 312 bp upstream of the psbA gene, DNA amplification of this repeated region from 11 pine species identified nine length variants, The polymorphic amplified fragments were isolated and the DNA sequence was determined, confirming that the length polymorphism was caused by variation in the length of the repeated region, In the pines, the chloroplast genome is transmitted through pollen and this PCR assay may be used to monitor gene flow in this genus. Analysis of 305 individuals from seven populations of Pinus leucodermis Ant. revealed the presence of four variants with intrapopulational diversities ranging from 0.000 to 0.629 and an average of 0.320. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of cpDNA on the same populations previously failed to detect any variation, Population subdivision based on cpSSR was higher (G(st) = 0.22, where G(st) is coefficient of gene differentiation) than that revealed in a previous isozyme study (G(st) = 0.05) We anticipate that SSR loci within the chloroplast genome should provide a highly informative assay for the analysis of the genetic structure of plant populations.

#Genetic variation of Pinus sylvestris from Spain in relation to other European populations.
#Prusglowacki, W, Stephan, BR
#1994
--------------------------------
Seven populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) from the natural distribution of the species in Spain were investigated isoenzymatically at 11 enzyme loci, and compared with 16 populations from northern and eastern Europe at seven loci. Populations from Spain are genetically differentiated in relation to the frequencies of genes and genotypes. The similarity between the 7 populations was studied and agreed to a significant extent with taxonomical subdivisions of Scots pine on the Iberian peninsula. The Spanish and the northern and eastern European populations form 2 very distinct and heterogeneous groups according to the genetic similarity. In comparison with the other European populations the Spanish material showed a slightly higher number of alleles per gene locus, a higher number of genotypes, and a slightly lower degree of heterozygosity. In the Spanish populations five were detected, which are not present in the other European populations, whereas in the northern and eastern European populations only 2 alleles were found, which were not present in the Spanish material.

#Increased selfing and correlated paternity in a small population of a predominantly outcrossing conifer, Pinus sylvestris.
#Robledo-Arnuncio, JJ, Alia, R, Gil, L
#2004
--------------------------------
Outcrossing rate, the rates of ovule and seed abortion, and levels of correlated paternity were estimated in a small population of Pinus sylvestris, a predominantly outcrossing conifer, and were compared with estimates from two widely dispersed woodlands of the same species, showing a range of densities. On average, seed trees of the small population showed an eight-fold higher selfing rate (25 vs. 3%) and a 100- fold greater incidence of correlated paternity (19.6 vs. 0.2%) than did trees from the large populations. No evidence was found of pollen limitation within the remnant stand, as suggested by ovule abortion rates. Investigation of the mating patterns in the small population, based on the unambiguous genealogy of 778 open-pollinated seeds, showed a large departure from random mating. Only 8% of the possible mating pairs within the stand were observed. Correlated paternity rate within a maternal sibship was negatively associated (r(s) = - 0.398, P < 0.050) with the distance to the nearest neighbour, and shared paternity among maternal sibships was negatively correlated (r(s) = -0.704, P < 0.001) with the distance between seed trees. Numerical simulations, based on the estimated individual pollen dispersal kernel, suggest that restricted dispersal might have been the key factor affecting mating patterns in the small population and, together with low population density, may account for the observed mating system variation between the small and the large populations. The results of this study show that a severe size reduction may substantially affect the mating system of a wind-pollinated, typically outcrossed plant species.

#Genetic differentiation of Scotch pine populations of the Carpathians and the Russian plain.
#Sannikov, SN, Semerikov, VL, Petrova, IV, Filippova, TV
#1997
--------------------------------
Genetic differences between six Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations were estimated by means of isozyme analysis of pine needles. Two populations were situated at different elevations on the northern slopes of the Ukrainian Carpathians, two were located on the Russian plain, and two were from the Kola Peninsula. The populations located on the Kola Peninsula and the Russian plain were similar: the mean genetic distance (Nei, 1978) between them was 0.003. However, mean genetic distances between populations of the Russian plain and the Carpathians were higher: 0.010 between plain and foothill populations and 0.021 between plain and mountain populations. These differences in genetic distances may be caused by long- term phenological reproductive isolation or by genetic drift in small mountain populations. The validity of subdividing the European subspecies of Scotch pine into plain and mountain population groups (climatic ecotypes) is discussed.

#Heterozygosity and fitness - no association in Scots pine.
#Savolainen, O, Hedrick, P
#1995
--------------------------------
The association of six quantitative traits related to fitness with heterozygosity at 12 allozyme loci has been examined in three populations of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris. Because of several characteristics of this organism and of this extensive data set, it appeared that this study would show a positive association between heterozygosity and these traits if indeed heterozygotes had higher values for these quantitative traits. Using several different statistical techniques including analysis of variance, regression with the scaling recommended from the adaptive distance model, and multiple regression, no evidence of an association was found. For example, only between 7 and 8% of the regression tests were significant at the 5% level and half of these showed a positive association and half showed a negative association. Further, the multiple regression analysis explained on average only 5.8% of the variation observed in the six different traits and only 1.5% of this variation was explained by a positive association. Power analysis was carried out (for the first time on these type of data), both for the single locus heterozygous advantage and the association of individual multiple locus heterozygosity and the quantitative traits. For diameter and height, two traits often used in similar studies, the average power to detect a single locus heterozygous advantage of 0.10 was 0.737 and the average power to detect a mean heterozygote advantage of 0.05 per locus for multiple loci was 0.797. As a result of this study and an examination of the published results from other studies, it appears that what positive associations have been observed are probably not, in large part, due to the presence of intrinsic heterozygote advantage.

#Genetic variation and differentiation in natural populations of the common pine Pinus sylvestris L..
#Shigapov, ZK, Bakhtiyarova, PK, Yanbaev, YA
#1995
--------------------------------
Genetic variation and differentiation for 12 gene-enzyme systems was examined electrophoretically in eight natural populations of the common pine from the southern Urals (Russia), eastern Germany, and Latvia. The observed and expected heterozygosity values, averaged over all loci, were 0.156 and 0.183, respectively. The proportion of polymorphic loci was 48.3% and 59.4%, according to the 95% and 99% criteria, respectively. The average number of alleles per locus was 2.18, or 1.96 according to the 1% criterion. Intrapopulation variation explained approximately 98% of the total genetic diversity, while interpopulation heterogeneity accounted only for 2%. Nei's genetic distances between the populations varied from 0.004 to 0.022, averaging 0.010. Cluster analysis did not show associations between the distribution of the populations on the dendrogram and their geographic location. These results confirm existing evidence on the high level of genetic variation and low differentiation, which is characteristic of most conifer species,with large population sizes and extensive ranges.

Electrophoretic analysis of nine polymorphic isozyme loci (Aar- 1, Aat-2, Aat-3, Gdh-1, 6-Pgd-1, Lap-1, Lap-2, Mdh-1, and Mdh- 3) was used to study adult plants and embryos of two crops on forest plantations and in the initial natural population of Scotch pine. On the plantation, genetic structure significantly changed in embryos collected in different years. It was shown that genetic variation in the first generation of Scotch pine grown on forest seed plantations was considerably lower than that in the natural population.

#Molecular systematics and genetic differentiation of Pinus sylvestris (L.) and P. densiflora (Sieb-et-Zucc).
#Szmidt, AE, Wang, XR
#1993
--------------------------------
Allozyme variation was examined in 22 populations of Pinus densiflora (Sieb. et Zucc.) and four geographic varieties of P. sylvestris (L.): var 'lapponica' (Fries, Hartman), var 'armena' (Komarov), var 'mongolica' (Litvinov) and var 'sylvestriformis' (Takenouchi). In addition, we developed paternal chloroplast (cp) DNA markers that distinguish P. densiflora from var 'lapponica', var 'armena' and var' mongolica'. UPGMA cluster analysis based on Nei's distances between all pair-wise combinations of the 22 populations revealed patterns corresponding strictly to geographic origin and taxonomic status. Analysis of allozyme variation in var 'lapponica', var 'armena' and var 'mongolica' demonstrated a high level of intrapopulational variability but a low level of interpopulational differentiation. It appears that the late Pleistocene blending of genetically diverse populations was responsible for the observed variation patterns. The constructed phylogenetic trees also showed late divergence of these three varieties. The var 'sylvestriformis' was genetically distinct from the other three P. sylvestris varieties. The genetic distances separating var 'sylvestriformis' from P. densiflora and the other taxa lend support to a separate taxonomic status for var 'sylvestriformis' and a close relation with P. densiflora. We found that var 'sylvestriformis' harbors admixtures of allozymes and cpDNA. from both P. sylvestris and P. densiflora, which suggests an introgressive nature of this variety. Levels of intrapopulational variability were similar in P. sylvestris and P. densiflora, but interpopulational differentiation was much higher in P. densiflora. In the constructed phylogenetic trees, populations of this species were characterized by relatively long internode distances and branch lengths. The present results suggest that P. densiflora has a more advanced evolutionary age than P. sylvestris.

#Empirical assessment of allozyme and RAPD variation in Pinus sylvestris (L) using haploid tissue analysis.
#Szmidt, AE, Wang, XR, Lu, MZ
#1996
--------------------------------
We analysed 20 allozyme and 22 putative random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) loci in two populations of Pinus sylvestris (L.) from northern Sweden. Genotypes for individual allozyme and RAPD loci were inferred from segregation pattern's in haploid macrogametophytes. Therefore, it was possible to distinguish between homo- and heterozygotes carrying a RAPD fragment and to estimate directly the frequencies of RAPD fragments. The percentage of polymorphic loci and the expected and observed heterozygosity were lower for allozymes than for RAPDs. Average fixation indices for both types of markers were negative indicating a heterozygote excess over panmictic expectations. The apportionment of genetic variation within and among the investigated populations was similar for allozymes and RAPDs and showed that most of the variation resided within populations. RAPD genotypes inferred from haploid material were subsequently converted to diploid phenotypes and used to estimate indirectly the frequencies of RAPD fragments. Gene diversity measurements derived from indirectly estimated RAPD frequencies were distinctly lower than those based on directly estimated RAPD frequencies. This result was caused by the absence of the null homozygote at many loci which appeared as monomorphic in the diploid data set. Population differentiation coefficients based on the indirectly estimated RAPD frequencies were not concordant with those based on directly estimated RAPD frequencies. Our present results indicate that when complete genotype information can be obtained, RAPD analysis provides genetic information similar to that revealed by analysis of allozyme variation. On the other hand, our results are concordant with theoretical results suggesting that analysis of RAPD variation in diploid material can produce unreliable estimates of population-genetic parameters.

#The genetic structure of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) population from the top of Szczeliniec-wielki mt, central Sudetes.
#Szweykowski, J, Prusglowacki, W, Hrynkiewicz, J
#1994
--------------------------------
The comparison of the genetic stucture of the population of Scots pine from Szczeliniec Wielki Mt. with the population of its progeny and three other populations from the same geographic region shows great similarity of both populations as far as the frequencies of genes and genotypes are concerned. Also other genetic parameters, such as heterozygosity, genotypic poly morphism indices and a number of alleles per locus were in both populations very similar. It seems that our data proved that the provenance trial experiments reflect rather closely the genetic structure of maternal populations. The fact that the population from Szczeliniec Wielki and its ''replica'' are genetically most similar to the geographically closest population from Bystrzyca Klodzka leads to the conclusion, that these populations are of common origin. Though the relic character of the populations from Szczeliniec can not be excluded. The morphological distinctness of the population from Szczeliniec is caused by a modifying influence of environmental conditions.

#Variation of some morphological and electrophoretic characters of 11 populations of Scots pine in Turkey.
#Turna, I
#2003
--------------------------------
In this study, the genetic variation in populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), one of the species covering large areas in Turkey, was investigated. Open pollinated seeds were collected from I I populations in a natural distribution range. Six characters of seeds (length, width, ratio of length to width, weight/1000 seeds) and seedling (cotyledon number and hypocotyls height) and two enzyme systems (leucine aminopeptidase, LAP; glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, GOT) were investigated. Significant differences were detected among the populations for the morphological characters. In addition, isozyme patterns of the two enzyme systems revealed that Lap has two loci (one with 2 alleles and the other with 3), while Got has three loci (two with 3 alleles and the third one with 2 alleles). Polymorphic loci were 80% on the average. The mean number of alleles per locus was 2.02, and expected heterozygosity was 22%. The mean total genetic diversity was calculated as 0.235; the mean gene diversity within populations was determined as 0.220, and the average between-subpopulation diversity was 0.014. Averaged genetic distance was 0.081. According to the genetic distance, population number 2 was separated from the remaining populations.

#Allozyme differentiation among populations of Pinus sylvestris (L.) from Sweden and China.
#Wang, XR, Szmidt, AE, Lindgren, D
#1991
--------------------------------
Allozyme differentiation al 14 loci was studied among 7 populations of Pinus sylvestris representing one geographic variety lapponica from Sweden and two varieties, mongolica and sylvestriformis, from China. The expected and observed heterozygosities were high and ranged between 0.165 and 0.282, and between 0.164 and 0.278 respectively. With the exception of the var. sylvestriformis, the patterns of genetic variation among populations were in accordance with the patterns of their geographic distribution. Nei's genetic diversity statistics showed that 7.5% of the total diversity was due to differences among varieties. Pronounced differences were found between the var. sylvestriformis population and the populations represent the other two varieties. On the other hand, less differentiation was found between the geographically very distant var. lapponica and var. mongolica. It appears that as a result of past events the patterns of differentiation among populations of P. sylvestris are more complex than previously thought. It is possible that the individual geographic varieties of this species have a different evolutionary history.

#Gene dispersion after natural regeneration under a widely  spaced seed tree stand of Pinus sylvestris (L.).
#Yazdani, R, Lindgren, D
#1992
--------------------------------
For determination of gene dispersion the patterns of certain, rare isozyme markers have been studied within a seed-tree stand of Pinus sylvestris in northern Sweden. The stand investigated consists of 18 seed trees per hectare situated in Arvidsjaur, Sweden (lat. 65-degrees 29). Marker genes for certain rare isozymes occur in several seed trees. Those markers are overrepresented among seedlings in the vicinity of those trees. Different seed trees contribute with their genes to the next generation in different proportions. In the seed-tree stand, many seedlings do not originate from seed trees in the neighbourhood. It seems likely that much of the natural regeneration originates from felled trees or sources outside the seed-tree stand. The study suggests that approximately one quarter of the seedlings within 5 m from a seed tree has that seed tree as seed parent.

#Nearly complete genetic maps of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) constructed by AFLP marker analysis in a full-sib family.
#Yin, TM, Wang, XR, Andersson, B, Lerceteau-Kohler, E
#2003
--------------------------------
We have constructed nearly complete linkage maps of Pinus sylvestris (L.) using AFLP markers based on a two-way pseudo- testcross strategy in a full-sib family founded in an advanced breeding program. With 39 primer combinations, a total of 737 markers (320 from the mother and 417 froth the father) segregated in a 1:1 ratio, corresponding to DNA polymorphism: heterozygous in one parent and null in the other. In the maternal parent, 188 framework markers were mapped in 12 linkage groups, equivalent to the Pinus haploid chromosome number, with a total coverage of 1,695.5 cM. In the paternal parent, 245 framework markers established a map with 15 linkage groups, spanning a genome length of 1,718.5 cM. The estimated total map length was (L) over cap (F) = 1, 681 cM for the female and (L) over cap (M) = 1, 645 cM for the male using a modified method-of-moment estimator. Combining these values with those estimated from the observed map lengths in both parents, we estimated the genome length in Scots pine to be between 1,600 and 2,100 cM. Our genome coverage was estimated to be more than 98% with a framework marker interval of 20 cM for both parents. Most of the female and male linkage groups were associated through the analysis of the intercross markers.

#Industrial pollutants tend to increase genetic diversity: Evidence from field-grown European Scots pine populations.
#Prus-Glowacki, W, Wojnicka-Poltorak, A, Oleksyn, J, Reich, PB
#1999
--------------------------------
The effect of heavy metal and gaseous pollution on genetic make up due to selection and mortality was studied in eight European Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations. Genetic structure of these populations was evaluated after 13 years of growth at two sites, one located in the vicinity of a copper smelter in Glogow (southern Poland) and another in a control area (Kornik, central Poland). Based on data from 10 enzymatic loci, studied by starch gel electrophoresis, the following genetic parameters were characterized: mean number of alleles and genotypes per locus, heterozygosity and genotype polymorphism index, genetic diversity among sites and genetic similarity according to Nei and Roychoudhury. Most of the parameters differed both between sites as well as between pairs of populations. Mean multilocus observed heterozygosity and genotype polymorphism indices were 8% and 6% lower respectively at the control site than in the polluted one. Populations from the site polluted by heavy metals demonstrate higher genetic diversity then those from the control. Genetic similarities showed differentiation of particular populations from both locations in response to industrial pollution. These results provide evidence that the general pattern of adaptation strategy of populations to pollution stress is connected with increasing genetic variation. The best isoenzymatic markers for monitoring changes in the genetic structure of Scots pine populations under the influence of industrial pollution are fluorescent esterase (FEST), glutamic-oxaloacetatic transaminase (GOT-A and GOT-B), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH-A) and shikimate dehydrogenase (ShDH-A) loci.

#Changes of genetic structure of Pinus sylvestris L populations exposed to industrial pollution.
#WojnickaPoltorak, A
#1997
--------------------------------
Isoenzymatic variation of Pinus sylvestris was analysed in populations from a provenance trial (IUFRO 1982) in Kornik and their replication in Lubon. The two groups of populations originated from the same seed pool, but the one in Lubon was exposed to pollutants emitted during the production of nitrogen-phosphorus fertilizers,while the Kornik provenance trial were used as a control group. The parameters determining the genetic structure of the studied populations - frequency of alleles and genotypes (average number of alleles and genotypes per locus), observed heterozygosity (H-o), and genotypic polymorphism index (P-g) - have higher values in the group of trees tolerant to pollution. Also fixation index (F), which indicates that homozygotic genotypes underwent selection in this group, as well as dendrites and dendrograms according to Nei and Hedrick, suggest that the genetic structure of the populations exposed to pollution was changed. The obtained results indicate that populations characterized by a greater genetic diversity are more tolerant to pollution.

#Patterns of pollen dispersal in a small population of Pinus sylvestris L. revealed by total-exclusion paternity analysis.
#Robledo-Arnuncio, JJ and Gi,l L
#2005
--------------------------------
 Patterns of pollen dispersal were investigated in a small, isolated, relict population of Pinus sylvestris L., consisting of 36 trees. A total-exclusion battery comprising four chloroplast and two nuclear microsatellites (theoretical paternity exclusion probability EP¼0.996) was used to assign paternity to 813 seeds, collected from 34 trees in the stand. Longdistance pollen immigration accounted for 4.3% of observed matings. Self-fertilization rate was very high (0.25), compared with typical values in more widespread populations of the species. The average effective pollen dispersal distance within the stand was 48m (or 83m excluding selfs). Half of effective pollen was dispersed within 11 m, and 7% beyond 200 m. A strong correlation was found between the distance to the closest tree and the mean mating-distance calculated for single-tree progenies. The effective pollen dispersal distribution showed a leptokurtic shape, with a large and significant departure from that expected under uniform dispersal. A maximum-likelihood procedure was used to fit an individual pollen dispersal distance probability density function (dispersal kernel). The estimated kernel indicated fairly leptokurtic dispersal (shape parameter b¼0.67), with an average pollen dispersal distance of 135 m, and 50% of pollen dispersed beyond 30 m. A marked directionality pattern of pollen dispersal was found, mainly caused by the uneven distribution of trees, coupled with restricted dispersal and unequal male success. Overall, results show that the number and distribution of potential pollen donors in small populations may strongly influence the patterns of effective pollen dispersal.

#Genetic variation in cessation of growth and frost hardiness and consequences for adaptation of Pinus sylvestris to climatic changes.
#Savolainen, O, Bokma, F, Garcia-Gil, R, Komulainen, P, Repo, T
#2004
--------------------------------
Responses to climate change will include changes in species composition, but adaptation through genetic change may also be possible. The response to selection depends on the availability of additive genetic variation and the strength of selection. We found that Finnish populations of Scots pine have much genetic variation within the populations with respect to two traits related to climatic adaptation. Heritabilities (standard deviations) were 0.67 (0.16) and 0.33 (0.17) for the timing of bud set of 1-year-old seedlings and for frost hardiness 0.36 (0.14) and 0.20 (0.13) (not significantly different from zero) in the northern and southern populations, respectively. The additive genetic correlation between the traits was 0.57 (0.07). The proportion of additive genetic variation between the populations (Q(ST)) was 0.86 (0.11). Assuming that the new phenotypic optimum can be deduced based on the current match of temperature sums and phenotypic means, we test whether Scots pine in northern Finland can change to the new predicted optimum through migration and local selection during the next 100 years. The simulation model was based on monitoring 10 populations of 100 individuals. Five independent loci with two alleles were used to model the phenotypic trait of growth period. The results showed that genetic change will be slow and lag behind the moving optimum. Part of the slowness was due to the survival of current trees, which makes establishment of new trees with more suitable genotypes slower. Adaptation in species with fragmented populations and little migration could be even slower. Artificial regeneration with suitable seed sources can increase the proportion of adapted genotypes in cultivated species.

#Genetic analysis of fibre size in a full-sib Pinus sylvestris L. progeny test.
#Ericsson, T, Fries, A
#2004
--------------------------------
Fibre length, fibre width, tree height and stem diameter in 25- yr-old Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) were investigated by genetic analysis. The analysis was carried out on nearly 400 trees for all traits simultaneously using multiple-trait, individual tree equations with simultaneous variance estimation. Narrow-sense heritabilities were estimated at about 0.3 for all traits except for stem diameter, which was lower (0.17). Low genetic coefficients of variation for fibre length may be partially explained by the sampling method, which was 5 mm increment boring resulting in fibre fragmentation, but the method served well for heritability and correlation analysis. The additive genetic correlation was strongly negative between fibre length and stem diameter, and strongly positive between fibre width and growth traits. The pair of fibre traits showed mutually strong negative additive-genetic but weak positive environmental correlation. The pair of growth traits showed no genetic but strong positive environmental correlation. Other correlation estimates were minor and uncertain, with the exception of a weak negative environmental correlation between fibre length and stem diameter. An additional approach, where stem diameter was regarded as a covariate, revealed positive environmental correlation between fibre length and tree height and negative environmental correlation between fibre width and tree height.

#Time trends in genetic parameters for height and optimal age for parental selection in Scots pine.
#Jansson, G, Li, BL, Hannrup, B
#2003
--------------------------------
Data used to estimate time trends in genetic parameters and the optimal age for parental selection were obtained from 13 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) progeny tests in southern Sweden. The final age at measurement was between 24 and 39 yr, corresponding to approximately half the rotation age in southern Sweden. Trees in each test have been measured for height 4-6 times, covering ages from 5 to 39 yr. Individual tree heritability for height averaged 0.16, and increased slightly over time, although there were differences among tests. The average additive coefficient of variation for height (CVA), which decreased with age, was 6.0% while the average nonadditive coefficient of variation (CVD) was 3.8% and did not show any significant trend over time. A model based on the natural logarithm of the ratio between the two ages at measurement was used to predict genetic age-age correlations. The efficiency of early selection was also examined, in an analysis considering total height at age 30 as the target trait. The optimal age for parental selection based on gain per unit time peaked at 11 yr, with a time lag for breeding of 10 yr. In the southern tests, the peak came some years earlier than in the northern tests. Selection efficiency based on present value with an interest rate of 5% showed the optimum at 11 yr.

#Genetic variation in height, branch and needle lengths of Pinus sylvestris L. from Siberia tested in Alberta, Canada.
#Rweyongeza, DM, Yeh, FC, Dancik, BP, Dhir, NK
#2003
--------------------------------
We performed the analysis of variance and covariance on height, branch length, height to branch length ratio, and needle length measurements from thirty open-pollinated families of Pinus sylvestris L. from Siberia, Russia. This progeny trial was replicated on three sites in central Alberta, Canada. At six years from seeds, there was statistically significant variation for height, branch length to height ratio and needle length. On individual test sites, values of individual-tree heritability for height ranged from 0.20 to 0.35, whereas values of heritability for family means ranged from 0.41 to 0.59. These low to moderate heritabilities suggest that a combination of family and within-family selection would be effective in improving height growth for this population on individual sites. Across sites, values, of individual-tree. heritability for height ranged from 0.03 to 0.06, whereas values for heritability of family means ranged from 0.17 to 0.29. These low heritabilities across sites were due to high genotype by environment (GE) interaction. Analysis showed that 87% to 99% of the GE interaction was due to lack of genetic correlation among sites. Heterogeneity of the genetic variance among test sites contributed 1% to 13% of the GE interaction. This shows that families in this population of Scots pine are not broadly adapted and are therefore suitable only for a site-specific breeding programme. The paper also presents and discusses results of other traits with emphasis to breeding Scots pine for production of Christmas trees, which is the main use of this species in North America.

#Genetic variance and covariance patterns of growth and survival in northern Pinus sylvestris.
#Persson, T, Andersson, B
#2003
--------------------------------
The amount of additive genetic and environmental variance for tree height and field survival, and the genetic relationship between the traits were estimated using data from half-sib progenies of Swedish and Finnish Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) plus-trees, assessed in 18 single-tree plot progeny trials. The progeny trials were established in northern Sweden and comprised 9-13-yr-old, Finnish polycross progenies or Swedish open-pollinated progenies. In total across the trials, 71 630 individual trees from 888 families were included in the study. At the overall level, the additive genetic coefficient of variation ranged between 3.1 and 16.3% for height and between 0 and 27.9% for survival, with averages of 9.5% and 14.2%, respectively. Narrow-sense heritabilities were moderate to low, with averages across trials of 0.11 for height and 0.06 for survival. At the within-population level, estimates of genetic correlation between height and survival were mostly large and positive, with an arithmetic mean and standard error across trials of 0.47+/-0.39.

#Genetic differentiation of autochthonous populations of Pinus sylvestris (Pinaceae) from the Iberian peninsula.
#Prus-Glowacki, W, Stephan, BR, Bujas, E, Alia, R, Marciniak, A
#2003
--------------------------------
Genetic structure and genetic diversity in fourteen autochthonous populations of Pinus sylvestris L. from the Iberian peninsula and two populations from the Massif Central in France were studied at eleven isoenzymatic polymorphic loci. The studied populations formed two genetically similar but heterogeneous groups. The first group consist of populations localized in North-Eastern Spain with two genetically distinct populations. The second includes populations of the West- Central part of the Iberian peninsula. Populations from the Massif Central in France are diverse from those of Spain, but are similar to the group from North- part of the Iberian peninsula. The existence of significant numbers of private alleles in Spanish populations which were not observed in populations from the Massif Central, suggests that the Scots pine from the Iberian peninsula probably did not take part in the colonization of Europe after the last glaciations and represents original ancient tertiary gene pools.

#Marker trait association for autumn cold acclimation and growth rhythm in Pinus sylvestris.
#Yazdani, R, Nilsson, JE, Plomion, C, Mathur, G
#2003
--------------------------------
The main objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in the genetic control of growth rhythm and autumn cold acclimation in Pinus sylvestris L. Eighteen full-sib families of P. sylvestris with parental origins between latitudes 62 and 67degrees N in Sweden were assessed for autumn cold acclimation (frost injury measured from artificial freeze testing) and growth rhythm during the first two growing seasons. One family north x south with 108 individuals was used for the construction of one linkage map for the male and one for the female parent using 286 markers from random amplification of polymorphic DNA. Marker trait associations (QTLs) for shoot elongation, growth cessation and cold acclimation were found on both maps. Some QTLs were verified in two additional north x south families. Proportions of the additive genetic variance explained by the markers (R- G(2)) indicated that genetic factors of large effect were involved in all investigated traits. Single or multiple markers accounted for between 16 and 47% of the additive variance in annual shoot elongation, between 42 and 79% of the additive variance in growth termination, and between 7 and 31% of the additive variation in autumn cold acclimation. The study confirms that there are major QTL regions on different linkage groups controlling a large part of the variation for growth rhythm and autumn cold acclimation in P. sylvestris.

#Intraspecific responses to climate in Pinus sylvestris.
#Rehfeldt, GE, Tchebakova, NM, Parfenova, YI, Wykoff, WR, Kuzmina, NA, Milyutin, LI
#2002
--------------------------------
Five population-specific response functions were developed from quadratic models for 110 populations of Pinus sylvestris growing at 47 planting sites in Eurasia and North America. The functions predict 13 year height from climate: degree-days > 5 degreesC; mean annual temperature; degree-days < 0 degreesC; summer-winter temperature differential; and a moisture index, the ratio of degree-days > 5 degreesC to mean annual precipitation. Validation of the response functions with two sets of independent data produced for all functions statistically significant simple correlations with coefficients as high as 0.81 between actual and predicted heights. The response functions described the widely different growth potentials typical of natural populations and demonstrated that these growth potentials have different climatic optima. Populations nonetheless tend to inhabit climates colder than their optima, with the disparity between the optimal and inhabited climates becoming greater as the climate becomes more severe. When driven by a global warming scenario of the Hadley Center, the functions described short-term physiologic and long-term evolutionary effects that were geographically complex. The short-term effects should be negative in the warmest climates but strongly positive in the coldest. Long- term effects eventually should ameliorate the negative short- term impacts, enhance the positive, and in time, substantially increase productivity throughout most of the contemporary pine forests of Eurasia. Realizing the long-term gains will require redistribution of genotypes across the landscape, a process that should take up to 13 generations and therefore many years.

#Genetic and environmental signals in tree rings from different provenances of Pinus sylvestris L. planted in the southern taiga, central Siberia.
#Savva, Y, Schweingruber, F, Milyutin, L, Vaganov, E
#2002
--------------------------------
Seeds of Scots pine provenances originating from all over Russia were planted in the Boguchany provenance trial at a central Siberian location (southern taiga) in 1974. Eight tree- ring density and width parameters for 16 different provenances were measured with densitometric techniques. The tree-ring data were recorded from 1982 to 1996. Correlation analysis calculated by raw series showed that tree-ring width decreases and percentage of latewood increases with an increase in the latitude of the seed source. High variability was found for raw tree-ring characteristics from tree to tree within each provenance for an observed period (individual variability). The age trend of each tree is well described by the chosen fitting curve, and is similar for the mean series of each provenance. As a consequence of these findings, the indexed chronology for each provenance mainly shows climatic signals. The SD of the indexed chronology (chronological variability) is low for each provenance, showing low sensitivity to climatic influences.  cluster analysis of provenances represented by tree-ring characteristics differentiated the provenances into three groups. However, the statistical distance between the groups was minor. So we can confirm that Scots pine provenances are highly adaptable to local ecological conditions and regional climatic influences.

#Genetic parameters regarding the resistance of Pinus sylvestris heartwood to decay caused by Coniophora puteana.
#Harju, AM, Venalainen, M
#2002
--------------------------------
Genetic variation in the durability of Pinus sylvestris L. heartwood to a brown rot fungus, Coniophora puteana, was studied using an in vitro decay test. Juvenile heartwood was sampled from 33-yr-old half-sib families growing in a progeny test and from their mothers in a clonal archive. The narrow- sense heritability for the heartwood weight loss was 0.37, and the coefficient of additive genetic variation was 28%. Heritability estimated by the regression of the offspring on mothers was 0.29, and the coefficient of genetic prediction was 0.24. These results indicated that it would be possible to improve the decay resistance of P. sylvestris heartwood by direct selection. According to the genetic correlation (r(A) = 0.36), selecting for heartwood density would result in an unfavourable response in weight loss caused by C. puteana. However, it appears that unknown environmental factors, which increase heartwood density, also decrease the heartwood weight loss (r(E) = 0.56). This result emphasizes the need for better understanding of the relationships among wood density, decay fungi, and environmental factors.

#Genetic characters and diameter growth of provenances of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.).
#Blumenrother, M, Bachmann, M, Muller-Starck, G
#2001
--------------------------------
Correlation between genetic characters and growth parameters was studied with respect to four provenance samples, which are part of a 47-year-old provenance trial of Scots pine. Two samples with superior growth were contrasted with two weakly growing samples. Based on a sample size of 100 trees per provenance, genotypes were monitored at 16 enzyme coding gene loci. Effects between genetic and growth traits were studied by means of two-factorial analysis of variance and linear regression models with respect to diameter classes and subsets of elite and non-elite trees within provenance samples as well as diameter subsets of pooled provenance samples. Significant deviations are evident among the genetic structures of the four provenance samples. In each sample, deviations from Hardy- Weinberg structures are indicated at single loci. Inbreeding does not primarily account for such deviations. The study of diameter classes reveals that an increase of stem volume tends to coincide with an increase of the observed heterozygosities in three out of four provenance samples. In the case of two- locus genotypes at 6-PGDH and MDH-C, significant effects of heterozygosity on diameter growth are observed. By focusing the two most frequent alleles at six differentiation effective gene loci, significant relations to diameter growth can be particularly verified for two locus combinations including AAT- A. The genetic comparison of the elite and non-elite trees, the first subset reveals larger values for diversities, differentiation and heterozygosities than the second does. The genetic comparison between the subset of the 50 thinnest and the 50 thickest trees among the 400 individuals indicates higher values for the genetic multiplicity and the gene pool and multilocus diversity for the subsets with superior growth. It is concluded for the present that isoenzyme gene markers reveal an indicative potential for quantitative traits.

#Genetic parameter estimates of growth and survival of Pinus sylvestris with mixed model multiple-trait restricted maximum likelihood analysis.
#Olsson, T, Ericsson, T
#2002
--------------------------------
To improve adaptation and production of forest trees in areas with a harsh climate, it is important to consider survival ability in addition to growth traits. For breeding decisions, parameters such as heritabilities and genetic correlations between such traits need to be estimated. Multitrait, restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation was used in a full-sib Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) progeny trial in northern Sweden to utilize all available information regarding survival and growth on the individual tree level and to avoid bias due to selection caused by mortality. The trial was evaluated at the ages of 6, 11 15 and 27 yrs, including estimation of age-age genetic correlations, which were high. During the period, the mortality reached 36%, the heritability of survival increased from 0.02 to 0.05, and heritability of tree height varied between 0.06 and 0.13. The genetic correlation estimates between survival and height were all positive and varied between 0.03 and 0.65. Univariate estimation, considering only growth and ignoring survival, resulted in much higher heritabilities of tree height. This should be an effect due to the mortality and thus a bias caused by selection.

#Geno- and phenogeographic analysis of Pinus sylvestris L. populations along the transect extending from the northern to southern boundary of the species range.
#Sannikov, SN, Petrova, IV, Semerikov, VL
#2002
--------------------------------
Nei's genetic distances (Nei, 1972, 1978) between 12 Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations were determined using isozyme analysis. The gradients of these distances along the 1500-km meridional transect in the Transural Region and Northern Turgai from the pre-forest-tundra subzone (the Synya River basin) to the southern steppe (the Naurzumskii forest) were calculated. We discovered that the genetic distance gradients (GDGs) progressively increase in the direction from the northern boundary of the range to the southern boundary of the forest-steppe zone and sharply increase in the insular forests growing in the steppe zone. The results of cluster analysis and Mahalanobis distance gradients with respect to a set of morphological characters of the cones provide evidence that Scotch pine populations of the forest zone share somewhat the same gene pool, whereas the group of Scotch pine populations in the insular forests of Northern Turgai is obviously differentiated phenogenetically from the insular forests of the Tobol region, which grow farther to the north.

#Genotypic stability and genetic parameters for growth and biomass traits in a water x temperature factorial experiment with Pinus sylvestris L. seedlings.
#Sonesson, J, Eriksson, G
#2000
--------------------------------
The objective of this experiment was to study genotypic stability for growth and biomass traits recorded in treatments with optimal and limiting water availability at two different temperatures and to study how the different growth environments affected genetic parameter estimates. Open-pollinated families of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were collected in 2 seed orchards with 28 and 35 families respectively and cultivated for 1 growth period in a growth chamber. Heritability estimates were generally moderate-high (h(2) = 0.3-0.8) for growth traits in individual treatments. Joint analyses of all treatments revealed significant family x temperature and family x temperature x water regime interactions. Family x water regime interaction and family effects were not significant. The results indicate low adaptation to water availability and a higher adaptation to different temperatures in the two Swedish Pinus sylvestris populations. If we assume that our results hold for a large part of the rotation the G x E interactions imply that climate change can alter the ranking of clones in a breeding program and thus decrease genetic gain. Studies of family ecovalence values showed that a minority of families (4- 31%) contributed significantly to the interactions. Selection for stability could be a possible way to reduce the negative effects of G x E interaction.

#Genetic variability of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) provenances in Spain: Growth traits and survival.
#Alia, R, Moro-Serrano, J, Notivol, E
#2001
--------------------------------
Plants obtained from seed of 16 Spanish and 6 German provenances of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were installed at five trial sites distributed throughout the natural range of the species in Spain. Five years after planting (7 years of age) the experimental material was measured for total height, diameter, number of twigs at the fourth year whorl and survival. The analysis confirmed that the rate of height growth of the Spanish is lower than that of the German provenances. whereas for the other traits the best Spanish compare favourably with the Germans. Provenance by site interaction was very significant (P < 0.01) for most traits. Attempts to model the interaction of Spanish provenances on height by simultaneous introduction of some climatic and geographic covariates on both factors were not successful but a multiplicative model with one bilinear term was enough to provide a sensible explanation of this interaction. Usually, provenances closest to each trial site were found better adapted than more distant ones but some provenances of close origin presented a different behaviour. Processes of adaptation and selection of these ancient populations could be considered as the main factors to cause this interaction.

#Genetic variation within and between populations of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) for susceptibility to Melampsora pinitorqua Rostr. (pine twist rust).
#Quencez, C, Bastien, C
#2001
--------------------------------
The genetic variability of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) for twist rust susceptibility and the consequences for genetic improvement of the species were evaluated after artificial inoculation of 1-year-old seedlings in greenhouse tests. Wind- pollinated progenies, factorial and incomplete diallel mating designs were used to compare two natural populations of Scots pine (Haguenau, France, and Taborz, Poland) and their hybrids (Haguenau x Taborz). Families from Taborz were significantly (P < 0.001) less susceptible to twist rust than those from Haguenau. Inter-population hybrids were as susceptible as the Haguenau population. No clear relationship between severity of infection, shoot length and phenological stage at time of inoculation was observed in intra- and interpopulation crosses. Differences observed between the two natural populations for their response to twist rust are suggested to be the consequence of local adaptation simultaneously for climatic conditions and pathogen pressure. Within each of the two populations, the effects of general combining abilities (GCA) for rust susceptibility were predominant, although estimation of individual heritabilities remained at a moderate level (0.30-0.54). In interpopulation crosses, GCA effects of Haguenau and Taborz populations were still predominant. Moreover, hybrid performance could be predicted with confidence based on the intrapopulation GCA values of parents. Genetic gain on twist rust resistance could be achieved quickly through intrapopulation mass or backward selection based on wind- pollinated progeny tests.


2325
#Retrospective genetic tests of Pinus sylvestris L. in growth chambers with two irrigation regimes and two temperatures.
#Sonesson, J, Jansson, G, Eriksson, G
#2001
--------------------------------
The objective of this study was to estimate genetic correlations between stem volume in seven 19-30-yr-old field progeny trials and growth traits assessed in 1-yr-old Pinus sylvestris seedlings in growth-chamber treatments with optimal and limiting water availability at two temperatures. The seedlings in the growth-chamber experiment were open-pollinated families from two Swedish seed orchards. The field trials were established with full-sib families with the same parents. The genetic correlations between stem volume in the field progeny trials and height and biomass traits in the growth chamber were mainly low or zero. There was no clear pattern of juvenile mature: correlations with respect to combinations of growth- chamber treatments, field test site temperature and water availability. Periodic drought in the juvenile stage did not improve the juvenile-mature correlations, suggesting that at the juvenile stage, the mature stage, or both. the families used in this study do not appear to be specifically adapted to drought conditions.


2326
#Genetic subdivisions of the range of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) based on a transcontinental provenance experiment.
#Shutyaev, AM, Giertych, M
#2000
--------------------------------
Studies were continued on the variability of 113 Scots pine provenances based on an experiment established at 33 locations in the former USSR in 1974 to 1976. Following the analysis presented earlier for height measurements (Shutyeav and Giertych, 1997) now an analysis is made of data on survival, stem diameter and stem straightness. A synthetic volume estimate (based on height, diameter and survival) was evaluated for phenotypic stability. On the basis of growth performance in various environments the range of Scots pine in the former USSr is divided into 10 regions (A- to J) and these divisions are compared with earlier attempts at subdividing this vast area. There is agreement in the opinions about productivity of the populations. It is high in populations from the south-west and from the East European plain, poor from the north, south and far east and medium from central latitudes in Asia. When based on other features the proposed subdivisions give a different picture. In stem straightness a distinct geographic differentiation is observed, however it is unrelated to growth performance and only slightly correlated with survival, thus for this trait a different split up the range is proposed into four regions (I to IV). This split up of the range does not resemble in any way any of the previous divisions.

#AFLP mapping and detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for economically important traits in Pinus sylvestris: a preliminary study.
#Lerceteau, E, Plomion, C, Andersson, B
#2000
--------------------------------
We have applied a two-way pseudo-testcross strategy in an analysis of Pinus sylvestris for genetic mapping and detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with economically important traits targeted in the Swedish tree-breeding programme. Based on 94 full-sib progeny of a cross between two plus-trees from northern Sweden we generated two parental maps using AFLP markers. The female map was comprised of 94 markers assigned to 15 linkage groups giving a size of 796 cM. On the male map 155 markers were assigned to 15 linkage groups, giving a total size of 1335 cM. The recombination frequency was found to be sex-dependent, being 29.3% higher in male than in female gametes. On the female map, 12 QTLs were detected (but none for branch diameter or wood density). Three QTLs for tree height accounted for 25.8% of the total phenotypic variation of this trait. When the QTLs detected for all the traits were taken independently, the percentages of phenotypic variance ranged from 9.3% to 22.7%. The highest value was observed for frost hardiness, an important trait in northern Sweden for which a major gene seemed to be involved. A cluster of QTLs for tree height, trunk diameter and volume was located on one linkage group. On the male map, four QTLs for trunk diameter and volume were detected. Due to the reduced number of individuals under study, the results are preliminary and have to be validated on more trees.

#Gradient analysis of the chorogenetic structure of lowland and highland Scotch pine populations.
#Petrova, IV, Sannikov, SN, Filippova, TV
#2000
--------------------------------
Gradients of genetic distances (GGDs) between 26 adjacent cenopopulations of Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) along the transects through the distinct landscape-ecotopic isolation borders were analyzed graphically. The results made it possible to reveal and quantitatively estimate gradients and borders of gene-pool structural patterns in populations of this species in the central part of Northern Eurasia. In lowland areas, the most distinct borders were found between pine populations growing on dry lands and in bogs (Pineta sphagnosa) in the forest zone of the Transural region, as well as between the Arakaragaiskii and Amankaragaiskii island pine forests in the steppe zone (Northern Turgai). In highland areas (the Urals and the Carpathians), the greatest GGDs were observed between low- mountain (about 600 m above sea level) and middle-mountain (850-900 m) populations. Analysis of GGDs is a promising gene- geographic method for determining population borders and studying the chorogenetic structure of species.


2329
#Comparison of homology and linkage of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers between individual trees of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.).
#Hurme, P, Savolainen, O
#1999
--------------------------------
Segregation, homology and linkage of 33 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) in three trees [P304, E1101 and F1 (cross P315 x E1101)] of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Markers were selected on the basis of a RAPD map constructed earlier for F1. Markers from three linkage groups were studied in P304 and E1101. In both P304 and E1101, 14 markers (42%) were heterozygous. Segregation deviating from 1:1 was found for three markers in P304 and one marker in E1101. With the restriction pattern test, two out of the 33 loci studied (6%) were found to be not homologous to the corresponding fragment in F1. Both of these loci were heterozygous, and they were not linked to any markers, which confirmed their nonhomology. Homologous heterozygous markers segregating 1:1 were mostly linked with similar order in P304 and E1101 as in F1. The results suggest that it might be necessary to verify the homology of comigrating fragments before using them even across individuals. It will often be desirable to use other codominant markers together with RAPDs.

#Time trends for genetic parameters of wood density and growth traits in Pinus sylvestris L..
#Hannrup, B, Wilhelmsson, L, Danell, O
#1998
--------------------------------
Genetic parameters of wood density in Pinus sylvestris were estimated and compared with corresponding parameters for height and diameter increment. Measurements were made on 10 mm increment cores from a 33-year old non-contiguos single-tree plot progeny trial. Totally 944 trees from 106 full-sib families were included in the study. REML-estimates of the variance components were obtained by iteration on a mixed model equation system and time trends for the calculated parameters were plotted. With the exception of the most juvenile wood, which showed higher values, the additive genetic coefficient of variation (CVA), the environmental coefficient of variation (CVE), and the phenotypic coefficient of variation (CVP) for wood density, all showed stable values over time. The heritability was high, fluctuating around 0.4 and with no tendency to differ between juvenile and mature wood. Wood density showed lower CVA but higher heritability than height increment. The effect of competition on the estimated genetic parameters was discussed and the effect seemed moderate for wood density and height increment but strong for diameter increment where CVA, CVE and CVP increased monotonically over time.

#Relation between genetic structure and susceptibility to air pollution of European pinus sylvestris populations from a IUFRO-1982 provenance experiment.
#Prus-Glowacki, W, Oleksyn, J, Reich, PB
#1998
--------------------------------
Results are presented of genetic variation and relation between genetic parameters with growth, survival and needle necroses of 11 European Pinus sylvestris populations growing in a provenance experiment established in 1984 in western Poland. One site was near a phosphate fertilizer factory, and other in an area free of acute air pollution. A significant differences were found between studied sites in number of alleles per locus: expected and observed heterozygosity, genotype polymorphism indices (all p < 0.1) and in tree height (p < 0.0001). On average all genetic parameters were higher for polluted site than for a control one. Differences in observed heterozygosity were related to height growth decline and plant mortality.


2332
#Inheritance of RAPD fragments in haploid and diploid tissues of Pinus sylvestris (L.).
#Lu, MZ, Szmidt, AE, Wang, XR
#1995
--------------------------------
We studied the inheritance of RAPD fragments in haploid and diploid tissues of eight parents and 80 diploid controlled F-1 progeny of Pinus sylvestris (L.). Most fragments detected in the diploid tissue of parents were also present in their haploid macrogametophytes. All fragments observed in the parents were found in the progeny. Individual fragments amplified by a single primer were observed in unrelated trees suggesting that primer competition is not likely to cause 'epistatic' effects on RAPD polymorphism. Segregation of all variable fragments observed in haploid and diploid materials fitted the proportions expected for a dominant Mendelian trait. The segregating fragments were either present or absent confirming the dominant character of RAPD variation reported in most previous studies. None of the fragments detected in this study appeared to originate from uniparentally inherited cytoplasmic DNA. Our present results provide additional support for the usefulness of RAPD fragments as genetic markers. Nevertheless, the few differences observed between haploid and diploid tissues with respect to some fragments emphasize the need for inheritance studies preceding the use of RAPD fragments as genetic markers.


2333
#Different genetic structures of 2 morphological types of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.).
#Hertel, H, Kohlstock, N
#1994
--------------------------------
The management of Scots pine forests in the Northeastern German lowland distinguishes two morphological types, the so called A- type with a narrow crown and finer branches, which can perform timber of a high quality, and the so called B-type with a wide crown and thicker branches. In the present work first results of a genetic analysis with isozyme markers of these two morphological types selected from three provenances are shown. We found a higher level of heterozygosity based on a higher number of rare alleles in the A-type group compared with the B- type group. The silvicultural thinning practice which favours the A-type trees by removing the B-type trees is discussed with regard to the genetic aspect.


2334
#Relation between genetic diversity and pollution impact in a 1912 experiment with east European Pinus sylvestris provenances.
#Oleksyn, J, Prusglowacki, W, Giertych, M, Reich, PB
#1994
--------------------------------
Results are presented of genetic variation and growth decline due to pollution for 11 European populations, 1 Turkish population, and 1 Siberian population of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in a provenance experiment established in 1912 in Pulawy, southeastern Poland. Since 1966 this area has been subjected to acute pollution from a nitrogen- fertilizer factory emitting high levels of SO2, NOx, NH3, and other toxic compounds. A significant negative correlation was found between genotype polymorphism indices and radial growth decline since 1966 assessed using tree-ring analysis (r = - 0.58, P = 0.04). Populations with the highest values for genotype polymorphism index, numbers of alleles per locus, and numbers of genotypes per locus exhibited less of a decline in radial growth than those populations with lower values for these parameters. The results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that genetically richer populations are better adapted to changing conditions and suggest that such populations are less sensitive to air pollution in terms of growth reduction.

#Allozyme variation in populations of Pinus sylvestris L. from a 1912 provenance trial in Pulawy (Poland).
#Prusglowacki, W, Bernard, E
#1994
--------------------------------
Study of the genetic variation and genetic structure of 13 populations of Pinus sylvestris from Eastern Europe and Turkey has shown significant genetic differentiation of the populations. The average genetic differentiation (index GST) is high (0.076), but it is about 50 % lower in populations from the area covered by ice during the last glaciation (GST = 0.035). The mean multilocus heterozygosity for 8 loci (Ho = 0.357) and the average number of alleles per locus are similar to those from the other parts of Europe. The genetic similarities of populations (Nei) are not correlated with the geographical localities of the studied stands.

#Genetic variation in photoperiodic preconditioning in Pinus sylvestris L. seedlings.
#Eriksson, G, Dormling, I, Norell, L
#1994
--------------------------------
Thirty-two southern Swedish families of Pinus sylvestris L. from a partial 11 x 11 factorial mating were grown at four night lengths, 3, 5, 7, and 9 h, from the start of their first growth period. At the end of the growth period, the plants were exposed to increasingly longer nights until total growth cessation. During the second and third growth periods, the plants shared the same growing conditions in the growth chambers, starting with two weeks of 6-h night followed by night prolongation as in the first growth period. The plants from the 9-h treatment grew more slowly than those from the other treatments in growth periods 2 and 3. The genetic influence of the growing conditions during the first growth period on the height increment during growth periods 2 and 3 was estimated by the female and male by treatment interaction variances. These variance components were relatively small and totally negligible when data from the 9-h treatment were excluded from the analysis. The data suggest stability in the parents with respect to preconditioning caused by varying photoperiods.


2337
#Genetic relationships between growth and quality traits in an 8 year-old half-sib progeny trial of Pinus sylvestris.
#Haapanen, M, Poykko, T
#1993
--------------------------------
Genetic correlation was employed to study heritable covariation among sixteen growth and quality traits in a progeny trial of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Phenotypic correlations and heritability values for each trait were also presented. The expected correlated response of the quality traits to mass selection for a single growth trait was studied on the basis of these parameters. Generally, tree height was found to be more closely related to stem quality than diameter or volume. The correlations between growth traits and relative branch and crown traits were mainly favourable with regard to breeding. The heritability values were moderate and relatively similar for both quality and growth traits. Genetic and phenotypic correlations appeared to be considerably analogous, especially when the latter were computed on the family-mean level.

#Genetic variation in nutrient response functions.
#Namkoong, G, Jonsson, A, Eriksson, G
#1992
--------------------------------
Genetic differences in the non-linear growth response function of Pinus sylvestris seedlings to five nutrient levels are analyzed to estimate the causes of variation. Analyses of genotypic differences as quadratic response functions, as stability coefficients, and as separable functions indicate that the estimation of genetic effects can vary widely depending on the analytical model assumed. The existence of different reaction norms is demonstrated.

#Changes induced by zinc smelter pollution in the genetic structure of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedling populations.
#Prusglowacki, W, Godzik, S
#1991
--------------------------------
Comparison of the genetic structure of a seedling population grown in an unpolluted area and in an area adjacent to a zinc smelter has demonstrated differences. When seedlings of Pinus sylvestris were grown in the polluted area both heterozygosity and degree of genetic polymorphism underwent a significant decrease (by 30% and 20%, respectively) compared to from the control in the unpolluted area. For studied enzymatic loci the seedling population grown on the polluted site failed to maintain HARDY-WEINBERG equilibrium, exhibiting an excess of homozygotes compared to expected levels. The changes in genetic parameters point to directional selective processes in the studied seedlings groups.

#Evidence of natural reciprocal hybridisation between Pinus uliginosa and P. sylvestris in the sympatric population of the species
#Wachowiak, W, Celinski, K and Prus-Glowacki, W
#2005
--------------------------------
Peat-bog pine Pinus uliginosa Neumann has become extinct or rare in many parts of Europe. It is supposed to hybridize with P. sylvestris but the influence of hybridization to genetic erosion of the P. uliginosa gene pool is unknown. In the presented study, the crossability between P. uliginosa and P. sylvestris was analyzed in a sympatric population at Wggliniec reserve in Poland. The aim of the study was to prove natural hybridisation and to estimate the influence of this phenomenon on possible natural gene pool erosion of peat-bog pine. A sequence polymorphism in the trnF-trnL cpDNA region of P. uliginosa and P. sylvestris was used to develop the species diagnostic PCR-RFLP marker. The marker of paternally transmitted cpDNA was applied in haplotype analyses of the progeny from open-pollinated P. uliginosa seeds (collected in 2000-2002) and from P. sylvestris ones (in 2002). An inconsistency in species diagnostic cpDNA haplotypes of seedlings and parental trees was observable both for P. uliginosa and P. sylvestris (about 1% and 2% of hybrids seeds, respectively). The results prove the occurrence of reciprocal hybridisation between the species. The influence of hybridisation on the natural gene pool protection and measures to reintroduce peat-bog pine is discussed.

#Structure of Pinus sylvestris L. populations in Bulgaria revealed by chloroplast micosatellites and terpenes analysis: Provenance tests
#Naydenov, KD, Tremblay, FM, Alexandrov, A and Fenton, N
#2005
--------------------------------
In the present study we investigated the genetic structure and genetic diversity of Pinus sylvestris populations in Bulgaria using chloroplast microsatellite markers and terpene analysis. We were interested in addressing the following questions: (1) can population structure in Scots pine be detected via chloroplast micro satellites markers and terpenes; (2) are there differences in population differentiation between the two analyses; and (3) how are the patterns related to geographic distances. Twelve provenances were chosen throughout the species' range in Bulgaria. Following DNA extraction, chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) loci were surveyed using six primer pairs. Between 4 to 8 size variants were identified at each locus. A total of 35 size variants at the six loci were identified, 11 occurring at low frequencies (< 1%). They were combined in 134 different haplotypes, of which seven represent 1/3 of the genetic structure. AMOVA analysis revealed that 10.99% of the variation was found among populations, while 89.01% was expressed within populations. The cpSSR analysis divided Scots pine populations into two groups, the first represented by populations located in the south-western part of the Rhodopes and Pirin mountains, while the second group is located in the northeast of Rhodopes and Rila mountains. Terpene analysis revealed that on average, 53% of the monoterpene pool in P. sylvestris was accounted for by a-pinene (range 47-59%) followed by (beta-pinene (range 6-12%). The presence of two distinct groups is weekly consistent with physical distances between populations, similar significant correlation between genetic distance determined by chloroplast microsatellites analysis and chemotype distance (determined by terpenes) was observed. Our results suggest that the structural pattern of genetic diversity of cpDNA in Scots pine populations is the consequence of historical biogeographic processes.

#Genetic structure of montane isolates of Pinus sylvestris L. in a Mediterranean refugial area
#Robledo-Arnuncio, JJ, Collada, C, Alia, R and Gil, L
#2005
--------------------------------
Aim This work investigates the population genetic effects of periodic altitudinal migrations and interstadial fragmentation episodes in long-term Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations at a regional scale. Location The study focuses on Scots pine populations in the northern Meseta and peripheral mountain chains, central and north-western Iberian Peninsula. The ample macrofossil record in the area shows that this 60,000-km(2) region represent a glacial refugium for Scots pine. The species occupied large areas on the Meseta plains during glacial cold stages, but it has periodically sheltered at high elevation in the surrounding mountain chains during warm episodes, conforming to a fragmented pattern similar to its present-day distribution. Methods We perform a fine-scale chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) survey to assess the genetic structure of 13 montane Scots pine isolates in the northern Meseta (total N = 322 individuals). Using a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), we test the hypothesis of genetic isolation among disjunct mountain areas. We use a standard coalescence model to estimate genealogical relationship among populations, investigating the potential role of the regional relief as a factor influencing historic gene exchange among Scots pine populations. Results Population haplotypic diversity was high among Scots pine populations (H-e = 0.978), greater than values reported for other more thermophilic pine species in the Iberian Peninsula. The AMOVA revealed low (but significant) differentiation among populations (Phi(ST) = 0.031, P = 0.010), showed that the disjoint montane distribution could not account for the genetic divergence among areas (Phi(CT) = 0.012, P = 0.253), and that there was non-trivial subdivision among populations within the same mountain region (Phi(SC) = 0.021, P = 0.012). The genealogical relationships among populations showed that Scots pine isolates growing on disjoint mountain blocks, but on slopes flowing to the same basin, were genetically closer than populations growing on different slopes of the same mountain chain, flowing to different basins. Main conclusions The observed genetic structure for Scots pine is consistent with its population history, inferred from the palaeobotanical record, with vertical migrations throughout climatic pulses and with the drainage basins and large long-term population sizes connecting different mountain blocks during the cooler glacial periods. Overall, the results suggest that, despite periodic interstadial fragmentation episodes, Scots pine biology provides for the long-term maintenance of high within-population and low among-population genetic diversity at neutral genetic markers.

#Comparing Bayesian estimates of genetic differentiation of molecular markers and quantitative traits: an application to Pinus sylvestris
#Waldmann, P, Garcia-Gil, MR and Sillanpaa, MJ
#2005
--------------------------------
Comparison of the level of differentiation at neutral molecular markers (estimated as F-ST or G(ST)) with the level of differentiation at quantitative traits ( estimated as Q(ST)) has become a standard tool for inferring that there is differential selection between populations. We estimated Q(ST) of timing of bud set from a latitudinal cline of Pinus sylvestris with a Bayesian hierarchical variance component method utilizing the information on the pre-estimated population structure from neutral molecular markers. Unfortunately, the between-family variances differed substantially between populations that resulted in a bimodal posterior of Q(ST) that could not be compared in any sensible way with the unimodal posterior of the microsatellite F-ST. In order to avoid publishing studies with flawed Q(ST) estimates, we recommend that future studies should present heritability estimates for each trait and population. Moreover, to detect variance heterogeneity in frequentist methods ( ANOVA and REML), it is of essential importance to check also that the residuals are normally distributed and do not follow any systematically deviating trends.

#Measuring the genetic structure of the pollen pool as the probability of paternal identity
#Smouse, PE and Robledo-Arnuncio, JJ
#2005
--------------------------------
Contemporary pollen flow in forest plant species is measured by the probability of paternal identity (PPI) for two randomly sampled offspring, drawn from a single female, and contrasting that with PPI for two random offspring, drawn from different females. Two different estimation strategies have emerged: ( a) an indirect approach, using the 'genetic structure' of the pollen received by different mothers and (b) a direct approach, based on parentage analysis. The indirect strategy is somewhat limited by the assumptions, but is widely useful. The direct approach is most appropriate where a large majority of the true fathers can be identified exactly, which is sometimes possible with high-resolution SSR markers. Using the parentage approach, we develop estimates of PPI, showing that the obvious estimates are severely biased, and providing an unbiased alternative. We then illustrate the methods with SSR data from a 36-tree isolated population of Pinus sylvestris from the Meseta region of Spain, for which categorical paternity assignment was available for over 95% of offspring. For all the females combined, we estimate that PPI = 0.0425, indicating uneven male reproductive contributions. Different ( but overlapping) arrays of males pollinate different females, and for the average female, PPI = 0.317, indicating substantial 'pollen structure' for the population. We also relate the direct measures of PPI to those available from indirect approaches, and show that they are generally comparable.

#Gradient genogeographic analysis of Pinus sylvestris L. populations in Europe
#Sannikov, SN, Petrova, IV, Sannikova, NS and Filippova, TV
#2005
--------------------------------
Gradients of Nei's genetic distances between 15 samples of Pinus sylvestris L. trees were analyzed along three submeridional transects, from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean and Transcaucasia. As a result, distinct chorogenetic differentiation was revealed between the populations of this species growing in climatically specific regions of northern and southern Europe. Considerable Nei's distances (DN = 0.045-0.056) and their gradients, combined with differences in stable phenotypic characters (the composition of monoterpenes and morphological parameters of cones) determined at the Pyrenean and Caucasian mountain borders, suggest that the P sylvestris species structure includes two South Eurasian subspecies, the Pyrenean P. sylvestris L., ssp. iberica Svoboda and the Transcaucasian P. sylvestris L., ssp. hamata (Stev.) Fomin.

#Distribution of genetic variability in southern populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) from the Alps to the Apennines
#Labra, M, Grassi, F, Sgorbati, S, Ferrari, C
#2006
--------------------------------
Alpine and Northern Apennine populations of Pinus sylvestris collected from eight different Italian sites were analyzed by mitochondrial nadI intron and InterSimple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) markers, in order to describe the natural level of genetic variability and to clarify their genetic relationships. The small Northern Apennine populations are the southernmost populations of this conifer in Italy. All the analyzed populations were spontaneous and reforested areas were excluded. The analysis of the polymorphisms in the nad 1 intron sequence confirmed that the Italian P. sylvestris populations have the same mitotype (mitotype a) as the Central European ones. In the genomic ISSR analysis the proportion of shared alleles between the individuals showed the highest degree of differentiation between French and Italian populations and a divergence between the Alpine and Apennine populations. Alpine populations showed a higher genetic variability (GD 0.310 +/- 0.0252) than Apennine samples (GD 0.217 +/- 0.019). In addition, the individuals from the Apennines did not show a clear population structure, suggesting a common genetic constitution of Apennine P. sylvestris. It is likely that this constitution is the result of a progressive genetic isolation between the Alpine and the Northern Apennine populations from the early Holocene. The genetic constitution of the Northern Apennine populations suggests the opportunity of a management where in situ conservation of such small populations could be coupled to their use as sources of suitable local reforesting materials.

#Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns show weak genetic differentiation between low- and high-elevation types of Scots pine
(Pinus sylvestris L.) in dry continental valleys in the Alps
#Fournier, N, Rigling, A, Dobbertin, M, Gugerli, F
#2006
--------------------------------
Two types of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.), found either in the lowland or in the subalpine zone, are morphologically distinguished in the central-Alpine Valais ( Switzerland), a dry continental valley. The low-elevation pine forests show signs of die-back since the early 1990s. We selected four elevational population pairs in the area, and two additional pairs in two other central-Alpine regions. Genetic differentiation between the two pine types, i.e. between elevations, and between two classes of vitality were studied using random amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD). Growth in diameter and sapwood proportion was further assessed. Population pairs, with one exception, showed weak, but significant genetic differentiation ( Phi(ST) = 4.2% - 5.8%). On the other hand, there was no correlation between genetic data and the die-back observed. We consider disruptive evolution, postglacial migration, phenological separation or wind directions as possible explanations. Differences in growth and sapwood proportions supported the assumption of adaptation to local hydrological regimes.

#Effects of heavy metal pollution on genetic variation and cytological disturbances in the Pinus sylvestris L. population
#Prus-Glowacki, W, Chudzinska, E, Wojnicka-Poltorak, A, Kozacki, L, Fagiewicz, K
#2006
--------------------------------
This isoenzymatic and cytogenetic study has shown significant differences in genetic composition between two groups of Pinus sylvestris trees: tolerant and sensitive to heavy metal pollution. Total and mean numbers of alleles and genotypes per locus were higher in the pollution-sensitive group of trees, but heterozygosity (H.) was lower in this group. Fixation index (F) indicates that trees tolerant for pollution were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, while the sensitive group had a significant excess of homozygosity. Cytological analyses demonstrated numerous aberrations of chromosomes in meristematic root tissue of seedlings developed from seeds collected from trees in the polluted area. The aberrations included chromosome bridges and stickiness, laggards, retarded and forward chromosomes, and their fragments. The mitotic index was markedly lower in this group of seedlings, as compared to the control. Both isoenzymatic and cytological analyses showed a significant influence of heavy metal ions on the genetic structure of the Pinus sylvestris population.

#Summary of the results of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) height growth in IUFRO provenance experiments
#Giertych, M
#1979
--------------------------------
Information is given about the organization of the Scots pine IUFRO provenance trials of 1907, 1938, 1939 and 1982. In spite of differences in opinions, wars and financial problems, international cooperation proved possible in the establishment stage of these trials. Sustaining interest was more difficult. IUFRO agencies were generally unsuccessful in achieving regular joint evaluations of results. Need for them constantly reappears in IUFRO resolutions but they prove unattainable. It is demonstrated on a few examples how mutually enriching such joint evaluations are. It is recommended that an internationally sponsored team should periodically visit, measure and report on the trials for the benefit of all. Twice on the initiative of IUFRO monographs were produced on the genetics of Scots pine.

#Dependence of dormancy release on temperature in differenct origins of Pinus sylvestris and Betula pendula seedlings
#Leinonen, I
#1996
--------------------------------
The chilling requirement of rest completion and the high temperature requirement of growth initiation were determined in three origins of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) seedlings and five origins of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings. In both the pine and birch the chilling requirement was highest in maritime Scottish origins and lowest in the most continental Finnish and Russian origins. The requirement for southern mountainous Spanish and Bulgarian pine origins was in between. In terms of the high temperature requirement, there were no clear differences between origins. These results suggest that owing to their high chilling requirement, which prevents the beginning of growth and the loss of frost hardiness during the frost-exposed season, origins from a maritime climate could be the most tolerant under climatic warming.

#Allozyme variations in six natural populations of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Turkey
#Bilgen, BB Kaya, N
#2007
--------------------------------
Genetic variation in six natural populations of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) was determined with isoenzyme analyses. For this purpose, haploid female gametophytes of seeds and horizontal starch gel electrophoresis technique were used. A total of 17 loci and 58 alleles were observed in studying 10 enzyme systems. The average proportion of polymorphic loci for populations ranged from 58.8% to 70.6%. The average number of alleles per locus per population was 2.65. The mean estimated expected heterozygosity (He) of populations was 0.294. A rather high proportion of genetic diversity (96.4%) was due to within-population variation and the remaining (3.6%) was due to variation among populations. The level of gene flow (Nem) was found to be 6.69 per generation. Nei's genetic distance coefficient ranged from 0.006 to 0.027 (mean 0.017) among all possible population pairs. The mean value of Nei's genetic distance is similar to the values reported for other European Scots pine populations. The low mean value of Nei's genetic distance among populations is enough to explain low interpopulation variation. According to genetic variation parameters, three out of six populations (Akdagmadeni-Yozgat, Refahiye-Erzincan and Vezirkopru-Samsun) appear to be preferable populations for genetic conservation and forest tree breeding programs.

#Spontaneous hybridization between Pinus sylvestris L. and P. mugo Turra in Slovakia
#Kormutak, A Demankova, B Gomory, D
#2008
--------------------------------
Molecular evidence for spontaneous hybridization between Pinus sylvestris L. and R mugo Turra in the putative hybrid swarm populations of the species in Slovakia was provided based on PCR-RFLP analysis of the cpDNA trnV-trnH region. Species-specific restriction profiles generated by Hinf I digests of the cpDNA products reliably identified R sylvestris and R mugo haplotypes of the embryos from open pollination. Simultaneous analysis of the respective cpDNA region in megaga-metophytes and embryos of individual seeds along with needles of a given maternal tree has enabled to score either the R sylvestris or R mugo haplotypes in the embryos illustrating hybridization patterns between the two species. Data obtained in this way indicate a relatively extensive hybridization which takes place between R sylvestris and R mugo. The extent of hybridization varied among populations as evidenced by the 41.1-58.7% proportion of hybrid embryos registered on the locality Habovka, and by the 8.3% and 2.7% proportions of hybrid embryos on the localities Tisovnica and Sucha Hora, respectively. The approach itself is recommended as a convenient method for monitoring the hybridization patterns in sympatric zones of the studied pine species.

#Spatial Genetic Structure Within Two Contrasting Stands of Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
#Chybicki, IJ Dzialuk, A Trojankiewicz, M Slawski, M Burczyk, J
#2008
--------------------------------
When considering neutral nuclear markers, genetic differentiation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations is known to be low. The homogeneity arises particularly as an effect of common ancestry in a recent evolutionary history as well as an extensive gene flow, especially through pollen. However, within populations several other forces may shape the spatial distribution of genetic variation, including establishment history, environmental and silvicultural selection. These local forces are known to produce non-random spatial patterns of genetic variation, however little is known on fine-scale spatial genetic structure of Scots pine. In this study, two stands of this species with different establishment histories, selected within one larger population located in northern Poland were genotyped and analysed for genetic variation and within-stand spatial genetic structure. Results revealed no differences in genetic variation, although stands are separated about 60 km, suggesting that the two populations share a common genetic pool. The spatial genetic structure in both stands was found to be slightly different and was attributed to differences in the mode of populations' establishments. Finally, results confirmed that gene flow in Scots pine is extensive, causing genetic homogeneity within a single population.

#Organelle Genetic Diversity and Phylogeography of Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
#Floran V, Sestras RE, Garcia Gil MR
#2011
--------------------------------
The paper reviews the present knowledge of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) diversity, historical and geographical distribution, based on mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA data. The observed differences in the estimates of genetic differentiation between different types of genomes suggest that both pollen and seed contribute significantly to gene flow within species. Organelles' diversity represents an important criterion which could be later applied in planning for future forest management and breeding through a better understanding of adaptation strategies of different Scots pine haplotypes. This analysis would provide valuable references when facing current day problems with climate change, species adaptation, and loss of forest with negative effects on biodiversity. Research on organelles' diversity could lead to important practical applications in areas such as traceability and eco-certification of forest products, and the identification of plant populations for conservation. Based on the results from earlier investigations, Scots pine in Europe can be divided into at least three evolutionary units (Spain, northern/central Europe and northern Fennoscandia), each with a different origin after glaciations. However, it must be emphasized that these interpretations are preliminary and further mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA data need to he analyzed in conjunction with evidence from pollen and fossil analysis.

#Allozyme variation of seed embryos and mating system in relict populations of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) from the Kremenets Hill Ridge and Maloe Poles'e
#Korshikov II, Kalafat LA, Lisnichuk AN, Velicoridko TI, Mudrik EA
#2011
--------------------------------
Allozyme variation at ten polymorphic loci and mating system was studied in three small isolated relict populations (4.4 to 22 ha) and in three artificial stands of Pinus sylvestris from the Kremenets Hill Ridge and Maloe Poles'e. It was established that the mean heterozygosity of 130 to 140 year-old trees from natural populations (H (O) = 0.288; H (E) = 0.277) was substantially lower, compared to 30 to 40 year-old trees from artificial stands (H (O) = 0.358; H (E) = 0.330). The observed heterozygosity of seed embryos (H (O) = 0.169 and 0.180) was substantially lower than of the mature trees from populations and artificial stands, respectively. In the embryo samples, irrespectively of the forest stand origin, substantial hetedrozygote deficiency was observed (at six to eight loci), compared to the Hardy-Weinberg expectations. The proportion of cross pollination in the populations and artificial stands was low, t (m) = 0.588 to 0.721; and t (m) = 0.455 to 0.837, respectively.

#GENETIC DIVERGENCE OF SCOTS PINE (PINUS SYLVESTRIS L.) POPULATIONS IN SERBIA REVEALED BY RAPD
#Lucic A, Isajev V, Rakonjac L, Ristic D, Kostadinovic M, Babic V, Nikolic A
#2011
--------------------------------
The ability of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPE)) to distinguish among Scots pine populations from Serbia was evaluated. Sixteen arbitrary 10-mer primers employed in the analysis produced 54 fragments of which 21 were polymorphic (38.89%). Certain rare and genotype-specific bands were identified which could be effectively used to distinguish between the populations. Polymorphism in RAPD markers among P sylvestris populations was high and sufficient to distinguish each of the populations. The results obtained suggest that RAPD markers are valuable for the genetic divergence estimation in Pinus sylvestris and for the study of divergence among populations.

# Patterns of genetic diversity that result from bottlenecks in Scots Pine and the implications for local genetic conservation and management practices in Bulgaria
#Naydenov KD, Naydenov MK, Tremblay F, Alexandrov A, Aubin-Fournier LD
#2011
--------------------------------
As one of the principal coniferous species of commercial importance in Bulgaria, Scots Pine has been subjected to strict management, which has posed a challenge for the conservation and management of its gene pool. In this study, we measured genetic diversity and population structure using 6 microsatellite loci in 12 populations from Bulgarian mountain ranges. Our analysis showed good intrapopulation divergence (18.22%; AMOVA) and genetic evidence of bottlenecks. "NJ-IAM and non-admixing clusters divided the populations into 3 large groups. Our microsatellite analysis was consistent with the documented mountain effect influence on genetic diversity. Two methods-the Coalescent Bayesian model and M-stat analysis-implicated recent bottlenecks for all populations suggesting that the genetic structure of Bulgarian Scots Pine was shaped over a long period (one thousand generations; i.e. 20 0 years) by the interaction of genetic and autoecological processes. Our results suggest that conservation and management practices should strive to maintain this genetic differentiation specifically by emphasizing reforestation efforts with stocks from local provenances to avoid nonlocal introductions."

#Revisiting protein heterozygosity in plants-nucleotide diversity in allozyme coding genes of conifer Pinus sylvestris
#Pyhajarvi T, Kujala ST, Savolainen O
#2011
--------------------------------
Allozyme variation has been and continues to be a major source of information on the level of genetic variation among plant species. Deciphering the molecular basis of electrophoretic variation is essential for understanding the forces affecting the protein level variation. In this study, the relationship between allozyme heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity in plants is investigated among and within species. Allozyme and nucleotide diversity in 27 plant species was reviewed. At the multilocus level, the two methods are congruent: a clear correlation between the two measures of genetic diversity among plant species was observed, strengthening the view that effective population size is the major determinant of genome-wide diversity. Nucleotide diversity at six allozyme coding genes (6pgdB, aco, gdh, gotC, mdhA, and mdhB) in conifer Pinus sylvestris was investigated jointly with electrophoretic data. Single non-synonymous charge-changing mutations were found together with electrophoretic alleles that consequently were mutationally unique. Synonymous site nucleotide diversity (point estimate of theta (W)-0.009 per bp) and silent site divergence from Pinus pinaster at allozyme coding loci were at comparable levels with other loci in the species. Linkage disequilibrium was extensive compared to earlier estimates from P. sylvestris and other trees, spanning several kilobases. Allozyme coding genes had an excess of closely related haplotypes whose frequency has recently increased possibly as a result of partial selective sweeps or balancing selection, but complex demographic effects cannot be excluded.

#Seasonal patterns of photochemical capacity and spring phenology reveal genetic differentiation among native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations in Scotland
#Salmela MJ, Cavers S, Cottrell JE, Iason GR, Ennos RA
#2011
--------------------------------
Environment-driven genetic differentiation among populations is a common feature among forest trees, and an understanding of how populations have adapted to their home site conditions is essential for management and conservation practices. In Scotland, 84 native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) woodlands are recognised by the Forestry Commission and they occupy highly diverse environments from the maritime west coast to continental sites in eastern Scotland. However, it is not known whether adaptations to local environments along sharp temperature and rainfall gradients have occurred in different populations and as a result, the seed transfer guidelines of the species are based only on data from isozymes and monoterpenes. In this study of an outdoor common-garden trial, we used chlorophyll fluorescence to examine whether seedlings from 32 open-pollinated families and eight populations from sites experiencing contrasting annual temperature regimes differed in their response to variation in natural outdoor temperatures between September 2009 and May 2010. In addition, growth initiation in spring was recorded. Photochemical capacity at photosystem II F(v)/F(m) showed a distinct seasonal trend and remained at relatively high levels (similar to 0.7) until November. Following a period of over 2 weeks with temperatures below or close to 0 degrees C, F(v)/F(m) started decreasing towards its minimum values recorded in early March when population means varied between 0.35 and 0.45. By early May and along with rising temperatures, photochemical capacity had recovered to the same level as observed in early November. Populations were found to respond differently to the cold period starting in December. The largest drop in photochemical capacity was observed in seedlings from a low-altitude population located in the maritime western Scotland, while in seedlings from higher-altitude locations in the cooler eastern Scotland, the response was smaller. In March, the recovery of photochemical capacity was slowest in seedlings from the mildest and coolest sites. Evidence of adaptive genetic differentiation was also found in spring phenology. Initiation of shoot elongation and needle flush were earlier in families from higher altitudes (cooler areas), but population differences were not significant at the alpha = 0.05 level. These results suggest that adaptation to the spatially heterogeneous environment in Scotland has taken place in Scots pine and that in order to minimise the risk of planting maladapted seed stock, the patterns of environmental and adaptive genetic variation should be taken into account in the management of genetic resources in this species.

#nsularization and polymorphism in marginal island populations of Pinus sylvestris L
#Sannikov SN, Petrova IV, Sannikova NS, Egorov EV, Filippova TV
#2011
--------------------------------
Comparative allozyme analysis of 26 marginal island populations of Pinus sylvestris L. and 20 populations from the center of the species range has confirmed, at the species level, the Wright-Dubinin "island model of automatic genetic processes and Mayr's hypothesis about homozygotization of small isolated populations at range boundaries. It has been shown that the polymorphism of isolated populations sharply decreases when their area is reduced below 15-20 km(2) and increases to the level observed in the center of the range when the population area exceeds 50-100 km(2). A chorogenetic classification of marginal P. sylvestris populations is proposed."

#Genetic differentiation of Pinus mugo Turra and P. sylvestris L. populations in the Ukrainian Carpathians and the Swiss Alps
#Sannikov SN, Petrova IV, Schweingruber F, Egorov EV, Parpan TV
#2011
--------------------------------
The allozyme analysis of six local populations of Pinus mugo Turra and six populations of P. sylvestris L. in the Ukrainian Carpathians, Swiss Alps, and Schwarzwald has shown a higher polymorphism and greater interpopulation differentiation of the Carpathian group of P. mugo populations compared to the Alpine group (Nei's genetic distance DN (78) at the level of geographic population group is -0.023). A genetic differentiation of DN (78) = 0.049 between these populations, which are isolated by a distance of more than 1000 km, has been found. This confirms the existence of the subspecies P. mugo ssp. mugo and P. mugo ssp. uncinata in the Carpathians and Alps, respectively. The hypothesis is put forward that the former subspecies has been formed in the Balkans and the latter, in the Pyreneans. It has been demonstrated that regional populations and geographic groups of P. sylvestris are less differentiated than those of P. mugo.

#Speciation history of three closely related pines Pinus mugo (T.), P. uliginosa (N.) and P. sylvestris (L.)
#Wachowiak W, Palme AE, Savolainen O
#2011
--------------------------------
Nucleotide polymorphisms at genomic regions including 17 nuclear loci, two chloroplast and one mitochondrial DNA fragments were used to study the speciation history of three pine species: dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo), peat-bog pine (P. uliginosa) and Scots pine (P. sylvestris). We set out to investigate three specific speciation scenarios: (I) P. uliginosa is a homoploid hybrid between the other two, (II) the species have evolved without gene flow after divergence and (III) there has been substantial gene flow between the species since their divergence. Overall, the genetic data suggest that P. mugo and P. uliginosa share the same gene pool (average net divergence of 0.0001) and that the phenotypic differences (e.g. growth form) are most likely due to very limited areas of the genome. P. mugo and P. uliginosa are more diverged from P. sylvestris than from each other (average net divergence of 0.0027 and 0.0026, respectively). The nucleotide patterns can best be explained by the divergence with migration speciation scenario, although the hybrid speciation scenario with small genomic contribution from P. sylvestris cannot be completely ruled out. We suggest that the large amount of shared polymorphisms between the pine taxa and the lack of monophyly at all loci studied between P. sylvestris and P. mugo-P. uliginosa can largely be explained by relatively recent speciation history and large effective population sizes but also by interspecific gene flow. These closely related pine taxa form an excellent system for searching for loci involved in adaptive variation as they are differentiated in phenotype and ecology but have very similar genetic background.

#High genetic diversity at the extreme range edge: nucleotide variation at nuclear loci in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Scotland
#Wachowiak W, Salmela MJ, Ennos RA, Iason G, Cavers S
#2011
--------------------------------
Nucleotide polymorphism at 12 nuclear loci was studied in Scots pine populations across an environmental gradient in Scotland, to evaluate the impacts of demographic history and selection on genetic diversity. At eight loci, diversity patterns were compared between Scottish and continental European populations. At these loci, a similar level of diversity (theta(sil) = similar to B0.01) was found in Scottish vs mainland European populations, contrary to expectations for recent colonization, however, less rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium was observed in the former (rho = 0.0086 +/- 0.0009, rho = 0.0245 +/- 0.0022, respectively). Scottish populations also showed a deficit of rare nucleotide variants (multi-locus Tajima's D = 0.316 vs D = -0.379) and differed significantly from mainland populations in allelic frequency and/or haplotype structure at several loci. Within Scotland, western populations showed slightly reduced nucleotide diversity (pi(tot) = 0.0068) compared with those from the south and east (0.0079 and 0.0083, respectively) and about three times higher recombination to diversity ratio (rho/theta = 0.71 vs 0.15 and 0.18, respectively). By comparison with results from coalescent simulations, the observed allelic frequency spectrum in the western populations was compatible with a relatively recent bottleneck (0.00175 x 4N(e) generations) that reduced the population to about 2% of the present size. However, heterogeneity in the allelic frequency distribution among geographical regions in Scotland suggests that subsequent admixture of populations with different demographic histories may also have played a role.

#GENETIC DIVERSITY IN RELATION TO SECONDARY SUCCESSION OF FOREST TREE COMMUNITIES
#Wehenkel C, Javier Corral-Rivas J, Ciro Hernandez-Diaz J
#2011
--------------------------------
Forest succession is a fundamental ecological process, which has significant implications for the biological, biophysical, and biogeochemical processes in an ecosystem. Genetic diversity is not only a product of the number of species present in a given area, but also of successional change from colonization of gaps by pioneer species to mature climax forest. Genetic diversity should be higher in earlier successional stages than in later stages because high environmental predictability in later successional stages favours low genetic diversity. In the present study the relationship between secondary succession and genetic diversity was explored in eight stands of characteristic tree communities in the Thuringian forest area (Germany). Each of the eight stands was subdivided into six plots in a grid of 40 x 40 m to detect as much as possible tree species and genetic variants within the forest tree community and succession-specific structures. To define secondary succession, the mean Ellenberg indicator values for light and nitrogen in the herb layer, weighted for coverage, as well as the percentage of climax tree species in naturally regenerated stands were used. All species and genotype diversities based on the investigated tree species were calculated by the so-called Hill numbers. The results showed that the Gregorius's Covariation (C) of secondary succession with the transspecific genotype diversity as well as the transspecific genotype diversity per species for the enzyme systems AAT, HEK, PGI, MDH, IDH as well as the AFLP trait was statistically significant in several relationships. The transspecific genotype diversities were often significantly greater in the earlier successional stages than in the later stages. Selection effects during replacement of light and nitrogen demanding species and plant communities by more economical and competitive species such as Abies alba Mill. and Fagus sylvatica L. probably dominated in the study. Based on the results of the study, we conclude that genetic diversity may be an essential attribute of stages of secondary succession that should be further explored because of its relation to adaptability and ecological stability.

#INTERPOPULATION GENETIC-ECOLOGICAL VARIATION OF SCOTS PINE (Pinus sylvestris L.) IN SERBIA
#Lucic A, Isajev V, Cvjeticanin R, Rakonjac L, Novakovic M, Nikolic A, Drinic SM
#2011
--------------------------------
The genetic-ecological variation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Serbia was studied in the populations at five localities in western and south-western Serbia. Three groups of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations were differentiated based on genetic research (seed protein analysis) and plant community research. The first group consists of Scots pine populations on Sargan (FMU "Sargan") and on Tara (FMU "Kaluderske Bare"), where the forests belong to the community of Scots pine and Austrian pine (Pinetum sylvestris-nigrae Pavlovic 1951). The second group covers the localities Stolovi (FMU "Radocelo-Crepuljnik") and Zlatar (FMU "Zlatar I"), where the forests belong to the community of Scots pine and spruce (Piceo abietis-Pinetum sylvestris Stefanovic 1960). The third group comprises the Scots pine population on Pester (FMU "Dubocica-Bare") which belongs to the community of Scots pine with erica (Erico-Pinetum sylvestris Stefanovic 1963). Cluster analysis was performed on the basis of seed protein data and showed that there are three groups of Scots pine populations. The three populations coincide with plant communities. The community of Scots pine with erica (Erico-Pinetum sylvestris Stefanovic 1963) recorded on Pester at the locality "Dubocica-Bare in the area of FE Golija Ivanjica is a special Scots pine population displayed at the greatest distance from all other populations in the cluster analysis dendrogram."

#A system of Pleistocene refugia for Pinus sylvestris L. in the southern marginal part of the species range
#Sannikov, S. N., Petrova, I. V., Egorov, E. V., Sannikova, N. S.
#2014
--------------------------------
An allozyme analysis of 67 Pinus sylvestris L. populations distributed over the entire species range has provided a basis for determining locations of 12 hypothetical Pleistocene refugia (HPRs) in its southern marginal part and estimating their relative contributions to the gene pools of seven phylogeographic population groups (PPGs) in the glaciated zone of the range. Using Nei's (1978) minimum genetic distances (DN78 < 0.015) reflecting similarities and differences in allele frequencies between PPGs and the refugia, it has been shown that the main contributions to the P. sylvestris gene pool in Central Europe, Scandinavia, and the Russian Plain were probably made by the Balkan and Southern Ural refugia, and in Western and Central Siberia, by the Southern Ural, Turgai, and Southern Siberian mountain refugia.

#Estimating exotic gene flow into native pine stands: zygotic vs. gametic components
#Unger, G. M., Vendramin, G. G., Robledo-Arnuncio, J. J.
#2014
--------------------------------
Monitoring contemporary gene flow from widespread exotic plantations is becoming an important problem in forest conservation genetics. In plants, where both seed and pollen disperse, three components of exotic gene flow with potentially unequal consequences should be, but have not been, explicitly distinguished: zygotic, male gametic and female gametic. Building on a previous model for estimating contemporary rates of zygotic and male gametic gene flow among plant populations, we present here an approach that additionally estimates the third (female gametic) gene flow component, based on a combination of uni- and biparentally inherited markers. Using this method and a combined set of chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites, we estimate gene flow rates from exotic plantations into two Iberian relict stands of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Results show neither zygotic nor female gametic gene flow but moderate (6-8%) male gametic introgression for both species, implying significant dispersal of pollen, but not of seeds, from exotic plantations into native stands shortly after introduced trees reached reproductive maturity. Numerical simulation results suggest that the model yields reasonably accurate estimates for our empirical data sets, especially for larger samples. We discuss conservation management implications of observed levels of exposure to nonlocal genes and identify research needs to determine potentially associated hazards. Our approach should be useful for plant ecologists and ecosystem managers interested in the vectors of contemporary genetic connectivity among discrete plant populations.

#GENETIC DIVERSITY OF SCOTS PINE (PINUS SYLVESTRIS L.) POPULATIONS IN SERBIA REVEALED BY SSR MARKERS
#Lucic, Aleksandar, Popovic, Vladan, Nevenic, Marija, Ristic, Danijela, Rakonjac, Ljubinko, Cirkovic-Mitrovic, Tatjana, Mladenovic-Drinic, Snezana
#2014
--------------------------------
This paper presents the results of analysis of the genetic variability of seven Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations in Serbia using SSR markers. Genomic DNA was isolated from seed tissue of all seven populations. The concentration of DNA samples was within the range of 1-4 mu g/mu l. Different PCR protocols were used depending on the type of SSR markers. The total number of fragments obtained by SSR analysis with 4 selected primers was 17 (only bands of strong and medium intensity were considered), of which 6 fragments were polymorphic (35.29%). In order to analyze the genetic similarity of the analyzed populations, graphs of correspondence analysis and UPGMA clusters were produced. By comparative analysis of the obtained dendrograms, the dependence of population genetic differentiation and spatial distance was observed, i. e. their isolation by natural barriers. The results indicate that in further research of interpopulation variability it is necessary, when graphically interpreting genetic distances, to use both methods of statistical analysis (UPGMA analysis and correspondence analysis).

#High genetic similarity between Polish and North European Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations at nuclear gene loci
#Wachowiak, Witold, Wojkiewicz, Blazej, Cavers, Stephen, Lewandowski, Andrzej
#2014
--------------------------------
Nucleotide polymorphisms in a set of 32 nuclear genes were studied in 19 mountain, peatbog and lowland populations of Scots pine representing known phenotypic races and populations of presumably relict character for the species in Poland. At 29 genes, the pattern of genetic variation was compared to 11 reference populations from Northern, Western and Southern Europe. Similar levels of nucleotide polymorphism and excess of low-frequency mutations were observed in Polish populations (pi (tot) = 0.0055, D = -0.308) and as compared to the reference samples (pi (tot) = 0.0054, D = -0.170). Bayesian assignment and conventional frequency-based statistics indicate that Polish populations share the same genetic background at the analysed nuclear gene markers. However, the populations showed a much closer genetic relationship with North European samples than other regional groups of populations. Across the very uniform genetic background of the populations, we identified several genes with outlier patterns of haplotype, polymorphism frequency variation and departures from compound neutrality tests. Our data indicate that the Central and North European parts of the Scots pine distribution seem particularly suitable for association genetic studies to link phenotypic and genetic variation at a large geographical scale.

#Microsatellite loci polymorphism of chloroplast DNA of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Asia and eastern Europe

#2014
--------------------------------
The variability of four microsatellite loci of chloroplast DNA was studied in 38 populations of Pinus sylvestris in the European part of Russia, in Siberia, Kazakhstan, Transbaikalia and Mongolia. High variability was observed in all regions. In total, 152 haplotypes were identified. The level of population differentiation R (ST) was 2.1%. The differentiation of three geographical groups of populations (European, Siberian-Kazakhstan and Transbaikalian-Mongolian) was insignificant (R (CT) = 0.004). At the same time, some rare haplotypes were found to be specific for a certain geographical region. Distribution of the rare haplotypes, which differentiated European populations from Asian populations and Mongolian and Transbaikalian populations from the Siberian, showed the independence of the history of these regions. This corresponds more to the hypothesis that the modern area of Pinus sylvestris originated via settlement from many origins than to the hypothesized single center of the post-glacial recolonization. The distribution of the pairwise differences between the individual specimens corresponded to the model of sudden population growth. The assessments of the age of this event for Pinus sylvestris (4.5-4.7 million years), which were obtained on the basis of this model, significantly exceeded the age of the Quaternary. Therefore, the revealed population growth is hardly due to the changes in flora related with the glaciation, but rather mirrors the moment of the species formation.

#Alternative ways of Pinus sylvestris L. migration from southern Siberia to Europe and Asia minor
#Sannikov, S. N., Egorov, E. V.
#2015
--------------------------------
Allozyme analysis of the parameters of the Nei genetic distances and gene flow between the populations of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. along two hypothetical alternative ways of their migrations in the Miocene-Pliocene from Southern Siberia to the Balkans, Central Europe, and Asia Minor was used; a lower probability of their settlement on the southern shores of the East Paratethys than on the northern ones was identified. It is suggested that the Middle Araks Strait of Paratethys in the Miocene and extreme aridity of the climate in the Pliocene headed the migration of the populations on the southern way, while on the northern way there were no essential water and mountain barriers for pine dispersal.

#Development and transferability of two multiplexes nSSR in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
#Ganea, Stefana, Ranade, Sonali S., Hall, David, Abrahamsson, Sara, Garcia-Gil, Maria Rosario
#
--------------------------------
Single sequence repeat (SSR) multiplexing is a semi high-throughput PCR methodology for the analysis of multiple SSRs. We developed two SSR multiplexes selected from SSR loci previously reported in the pine literature and tested the transferability of both SSR multiplexes in nine other pine species. We tested 234 nuclear SSR loci (nSSRs) previously described in the pine literature and selected ten nSSRs following the simple criteria of interpretability and reproducibility. Selected nuclear loci were divided into two nSSRs multiplex sets and their amplification was optimized for three different multiplex PCR methods based on: (a) a custom PCR protocol, (b) a custom protocol with hotstart taq polymerase, and (c) a commercially available kit for SSR multiplexing. To validate their performance, the level of genetic diversity was assessed in three Scots pine natural populations (Hungary, northern Sweden and southern Sweden). In addition, we also tested the transferability of these multiplexes in nine other pine species. We have developed two nSSRs multiplexes of five loci each that will contribute to reduce the costs of nSSR scoring, while increasing the capacity of nSSR loci analysis. Amplification was successful in all three populations (94 % success) and the level of polymorphism (7.1 alleles/marker) was similar to that previously reported for other Scots pine natural populations. Transferability of both multiplexes was successful for those pine species closely related to Scots pine.

#Development of new mitochondrial DNA markers in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) for population and phylogeographic studies
#Semerikov, V. L., Putintseva, Yu. A., Oreshkova, N. V., Semerikova, S. A., Krutovsky, K. V.
#2015
--------------------------------
Fragments of genomic DNA of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) homologous to the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contigs of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) were resequenced in a sample of the Scots pine trees of European, Siberian, Mongolian, and Caucasian origin in order to develop mtDNA markers. Flanking non-coding regions of some mitochondrial genes were also investigated and resequenced. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a single minisatellite locus were identified. Caucasian samples differed from the rest by three SNPs. Two SNPs have been linked to an early described marker in the first intron of the nad7 gene, and all together revealed three haplotypes in European populations. No variable SNPs were found in the Siberian and Mongolian populations. The minisatellite locus contained 41 alleles across European, Siberian, and Mongolian populations, but, this locus demonstrated a weak population differentiation (F (ST) = 5.8), probably due to its high mutation rate.

#GENETIC DIVERSITY AND DIFFERENTIATION OF PINUS SYLVESTRIS L. FROM THE IUFRO 1982 PROVENANCE TRIAL REVEALED BY AFLP ANALYSIS
#Androsiuk, Piotr, Ciaglo-Androsiuk, Sylwia, Urbaniak, Lech
#2015
--------------------------------
DNA markers have become effective tools in genetic diversity studies of forest trees. However, molecular marker analyses are associated with laborious and costly effort. One of the possibilities to overcome these constraints is to analyze bulked samples per population, rather than individual plants. We have used bulked DNA-based AFLP analysis to investigate genetic variation in Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) from the IUFRO 1982 provenance trial in Kornik (western Poland). Four AFLP primer combinations yielded a total of 309 bands, of which 208 (67.31%) were polymorphic. Thirty-six (11.65%) unique alleles were deployed randomly among the populations. Estimated genetic diversity and differentiation was high, as expressed by H-e = 0.238 and I = 0.356, and by genetic distance values which ranged from 0.154 to 0.363. A geographic pattern of interpopulation differentiation was observed, pointing at the individual character of populations from northeastern Europe. In the light of available data, we discuss the influence of historical migration routes, gene flow and human activity on observed genetic diversity and differentiation of Scots pine in Europe. Our results indicate that the AFLP method applied to DNA templates extracted from bulked leaf samples provides an efficient approach to elucidate genetic diversity and relationships among Scots pine populations.

#Genetic diversity and inbreeding in natural and managed populations of Scots pine
#Gil, M. Rosario Garcia, Floran, Valentina, Ostlund, Lars, Mullin, T. J.Tim, Gull, Bengt Andersson
#2015
--------------------------------
We carried out a study on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Sweden, where our objective was to quantify the genetic diversity and inbreeding associated with two widely used managed-regeneration practices, planting with improved material from seed orchards and seed-tree regeneration, and compare these with that found in unmanaged natural forests. A total of 196 evenly spaced trees were sampled from a naturally regenerated and two managed-regeneration stands (plantation and seed-tree), in each of three different regions in Sweden (Arjeplog, Vihelmina, and Hammerdal). Population parameters were estimated for microsatellite loci from the nuclear and chloroplast genomes (5 and 11 loci, respectively) and a single mitochondrial locus (nad7). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows no significant effects of stand management on the level of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic diversity or inbreeding (p<0.05). Duncan post-hoc analysis suggested significantly lower values for the chloroplast number of effective alleles (N-ea_CP) and total gene diversity (H-t_CP) for natural and plantation practices, as compared with seed-tree regeneration. The ANOVA supported a rather weak effect of the management factor (M) on N-ea_CP and H-t_CP, with p values of 0.08 and 0.07, respectively. Inbreeding coefficient (F-5) indicated a deviation from random mating in all stands caused by an excess of homozygotes. All the stands are composed of a mixture of half-and full-sibs, but no pattern of spatial relatedness was detected in any of them. Our data suggest that genetic diversity is similar in both natural stands and those with managed regeneration, probably because regeneration practices did not decrease the population size to a point where random drift effects might be important. The estimates for the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) genomes should be regarded with caution, as only five nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci less affected by null alleles (<25 %) were analyzed. Our investigation indicates that the reduction to five nSSR loci does not change the main finding of an absence of differences in genetic diversity among stands, except for the number of rare alleles (RA), which is lower when estimated from data for eight nSSR loci.

#Genetic relationships between Polish and reference populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Europe based on nucleotide polymorphism study at nuclear loci
#Wachowiak, Witold
#2015
--------------------------------
Adaptation to local environmental gradients is one of main characteristics of living organisms. Scots pine (Finns sylvestris L.) is the most widely distributed conifer in the world and main forest forming component in Europe. Based on genetic, morphological and growth performance traits, several local ecotypes of the species were distinguished across the species distribution range. The existence of local ecotypes differentiated at many adaptive and phenotypic traits provides unique opportunity for addressing the questions about the genetic basis of local adaptation across the species distribution range. However, information about the underlying population structure between ecotypes is needed for efficient studies of adaptive variation at molecular level. The presented study focused on the genetic variation analysis between nineteen populations of Scots pine from across geographical locations in Poland and eleven reference samples from Northern, Western and Southern Europe. The pattern of nucleotide polymorphisms at 673 polymorphic nucleotide sites found across twenty nine nuclear loci was studied to determine genetic relationship and population structure of different geographical locations. Genetic relationships between populations were conducted based on Baysian assignment and conventional frequency based statistics at the within and between population level. The results indicate very uniform genetic background of Polish populations of the species that despite high phenotypic and ecological differentiation most likely share the same recolonization history. High genetic similarity was found between Polish and North European range of the species. In contrast, differentiation was found in relation to the reference populations from Scotland and Spain that in previous studies were shown to deviate from simple recolonization model after last glaciations and had unique mtDNA mitotypes not observed in continental continuous range of the species, respectively. Considering high differentiation at quantitative traits between northern and central part of the species range in Europe but very homogenous genetic background found in the presented study, it seems that this part of Scots pine distribution is particularly suitable for association genetic studies to find genomic regions that are involved in species adaptive and phenotypic variation.

#Vidyakin, A. I., Boronnikova, S. V., Nechayeva, Yu. S., Pryshnivskaya, Ya. V., Boboshina, I. V.
#2015
--------------------------------
The DNA polymorphism in Pinus sylvestris L. from Severodvinsk, Upper Vetluga, and Vetluga-Vyatka populations, which were isolated earlier based on specific features of the geographic variation of allometric cone indices, was examined by the ISSR method. It was demonstrated that the Severodvinsk population of P. sylvestris differed from the chorologically adjacent Upper Vetluga population with respect to all of the examined genetic indices, and the Upper Vetluga population differed from the Vetluga-Vyatka population. It was suggested that the main the reason for the lack of statistically significant differences between Upper Vetluga and Vetluga-Vyatka samples of P. silvestris with respect to genetic variation indices (P (95), H (E), n (a), n (e)) may be their formation based on the gene pools of two glacial refugia. It was demonstrated that the proportion of the interpopulation component of total genetic diversity (G (ST)), as calculated based on the ISSR marker polymorphism, reached a value of 0.488, which was an order of magnitude higher than the previous estimates obtained based on data from allozyme analysis. It was concluded that P. sylvestris cone allometric indices reflected the specificity of spatial population subdivision, like the genetic diversity and population genetic structure indices calculated based on ISSR-marker polymorphism. Population isolation and mapping based on two-step phenogenetic studies is suggested.

#Interspecific gene flow and ecological selection in a pine (Pinus sp.) contact zone
#Wachowiak, Witold, Cavers, Stephen, Zukowska, Weronika B.
#2015
--------------------------------
Nucleotide polymorphisms in a set of nuclear genes were studied in a sympatric population of pines Pinus mugo and Pinus sylvestris that includes trees classified as pure species and polycormic (multi-stemmed) individuals of potentially hybrid origin. Patterns of genetic diversity were compared between those groups of samples and to the reference allopatric populations of the species in Europe. Polymorphisms at the gene loci clearly distinguished pure parental species as measured by conventional frequency-based statistics and Bayesian assignment of samples into separate genetic clusters. Most individuals classified based on phenotypic assessments as putative hybrids were genetically very similar to P. mugo showing no existing average net divergence and genetic assignment to the same genetic cluster. On the other hand, individuals of P. sylvestris showed homogenous genetic background to the reference populations of the species from Central and Northern Europe. Ten individuals of admixed genetic composition were found in all three groups of samples; however, the majority of hybrids except one individual were identified across the samples classified as P. mugo and polycormic pines. Those trees that contained a mixture of nuclear gene haplotypes observed in the reference populations of pure species and cpDNA from P. mugo, most likely represent the first generation of hybrids. Analysis of the allelic frequency spectra and compound neutrality tests identified deviations from neutrality at several genes. This contact zone seems suitable for selection of a mapping population both in hybrid and parental species for admixture mapping to effectively search for polymorphisms that may play role in species adaptive variation and speciation.

#Genetic variation for needle traits in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
#Donnelly, K, Cavers, S, Cottrell, JE, Ennos, RA
#2016
--------------------------------
The remnants of the Caledonian Native Pinewood are distributed across a relatively narrow geographic area in the Scottish Highlands yet inhabit a steep environmental gradient in terms of rainfall, temperature and altitude. Previous work based on common garden trials has demonstrated that native pine populations (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) exhibit differentiation in terms of growth, phenology and frost resistance. However, despite their important role in plant fitness, no such information is available on leaf traits, which have shown both plastic and adaptive genetic responses to environmental variation in other species. We analysed a subset of 11 needle characters in 192 saplings grown in a population-progeny common garden trial based on seedlots from eight native pinewoods. Narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) was estimated for each trait and found to be particularly high (1.30 +/- 0.33) for resin canal density. The majority of the phenotypic variation found was within populations, although interpopulation differentiation was detected for needle length (Delta AICc = 2.55). Resin canal density was positively correlated with longitude (beta = 0.45, Delta AICc = 4.23), whereas stomatal row density was negatively correlated (beta = -0.12, Delta AICc = 2.55). These trends may reflect adaptation for differences in moisture availability and altitude between eastern and western populations in Scotland.

#Hybridization in contact zone between temperate European pine species
#Wachowiak, W, Zukowska, WB, Wojkiewicz, B, Cavers, S, Litkowiec, M
#2016
--------------------------------
Hybridization studies are important to advance our understanding of the interspecific gene flow and its evolutionary consequences in closely related species. Hybridization and admixture patterns were assessed in a contact zone and reference populations of European pine species using sequence data from 26 nuclear genes and a species-diagnostic cpDNA marker. Reference populations formed three distinct genetic clusters comprising Pinus sylvestris, Pinus mugo/Pinus uliginosa, and Pinus uncinata. Evidence of population structure was found only in P. uliginosa. Based on phenotypic characteristics and molecular data, we identified five groups of individuals in the contact zone in Poland, comprising forms of the parental species and intermediates that were most probably the result of interspecific crosses. A combination of nuclear gene sequence data and a diagnostic organelle marker were used to show that hybridization is frequent in the contact zone and results in hybrid trees with distinct phenotypic identity. The influence of selection in maintaining hybrid phenotypes in environments unsuited to parental species was inferred from nucleotide polymorphism data. A lack of admixture in reference populations suggests that hybridization has not occurred during post-glacial migration and so the contact zone represents a distinct, active example of ongoing evolution. Pine populations in this zone will be a valuable system for studying the genetic basis of hybrid advantage in environmental conditions untypical of pure parental species.

#Large within-population genetic diversity of the widespread conifer Pinus sylvestris at its soil fertility limit characterized by nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers
#Pazouki, L, Shanjani, PS, Fields, PD, Martins, K, Suhhorutsenko, M, Viinalass, H, Niinemets, U
#2016
--------------------------------
Genetic variation is an important attribute of forest tree populations enabling them to adapt to spatial and temporal variations in environmental conditions. In particular, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) has an exceptionally broad area of dispersal covering different climates and soil conditions, but the genetic variability in extreme conditions has not been studied. We hypothesized that the genetic variability of P. sylvestris is enhanced at its soil fertility limit in bogs where stunted trees form a sparse canopy with reduced light competition, but in highly turbulent conditions generating ideal conditions for distant pollen dispersal. A total of 180 individuals were studied from three bog populations using five nuclear (nSSR) and five chloroplastic (cpSSR) polymorphic microsatellite loci (simple sequence repeats, SSR). According to both marker systems, high and similar level of genetic diversity (ca. 99 % within the populations and 1 % among the populations) was observed for nuclear (F-ST = 0.007 and R-ST = 0.022) and chloroplast (F-ST = 0.015 and R-ST = 0.023) genomes. Despite the low genetic differentiation among the populations, there was evidence of geographic genetic differentiation in the chloroplast genomes, suggesting that isolation by distance might be a possible mechanism shaping the present distribution of genetic variability. In addition, significant but low spatial genetic structure along habitat wetness gradient was found in nuclear genomes in one site. Significant cyto-nuclear linkage disequilibrium was shown between one of the cpSSR loci to all nSSR loci. The results demonstrate a huge within-population genetic variability in these sites and underscore the importance of pollen gene flow in homogenizing populations on these geographic scales.

#Present genetic structure is congruent with the common origin of distant Scots pine populations in its Romanian distribution
#Bernhardsson, C, Floran, V, Ganea, SL, Garcia-Gil, MR
#2016
--------------------------------
Owing to the fact that mitochondrial, chloroplast and nuclear genomes are differently affected by evolutionary forces, the comparative study of all three genomes in combination with paleobotanical evidences allows for a more accurate interpretation of present genetic make-up. In this study, we analyzed the nad1-nad7 mitotype, 14 cpSSR loci and 10 nSSR loci in 13 Romanian Scots pine (Pious sylvestris L.) populations from the Romanian Carpathians and two Hungarian populations. Previous analysis of the macro fossil records supports the presence of Scots pine and Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) during the glacial period in Hungary and Romania. For a better image into the population structure in the studied area we also included in the data analysis two outgroup populations (north and south of Sweden) of known post glacial origin, which resulted in a more defined genetic structure. Our study reveals that relatively high genetic diversity is preserved at all the Romanian and Hungarian populations, with no distinction among naturally regenerated, managed autochthonous and introduced populations. Furthermore, genetic differentiation analysis fails to distinguish the two introduced populations from the Romanian ones. AMOVA clustering is congruent with the paleobotanical-based evidences of contraction of Scots pine range since the Holocene to its present fragmented distribution.

#Substantial heritable variation for susceptibility to Dothistroma septosporum within populations of native British Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris)
#Perry, A, Wachowiak, W, Brown, AV, Ennos, RA, Cottrell, JE, Cavers, S
#2016
--------------------------------
The threat from pests and pathogens to native and commercially planted forest trees is unprecedented and expected to increase under climate change. The degree to which forests respond to threats from pathogens depends on their adaptive capacity, which is determined largely by genetically controlled variation in susceptibility of the individual trees within them and the heritability and evolvability of this trait. The most significant current threat to the economically and ecologically important species Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is dothistroma needle blight (DNB), caused by the foliar pathogen Dothistroma septosporum. A progeny-population trial of 4-year-old Scots pine trees, comprising six populations from native Caledonian pinewoods each with three to five families in seven blocks, was artificially inoculated using a single isolate of D. septosporum. Susceptibility to D. septosporum, assessed as the percentage of non-green needles, was measured regularly over a period of 61 days following inoculation, during which plants were maintained in conditions ideal for DNB development (warm; high humidity; high leaf wetness). There were significant differences in susceptibility to D. septosporum among families indicating that variation in this trait is heritable, with high estimates of narrow-sense heritability (0.38-0.75) and evolvability (genetic coefficient of variation, 23.47). It is concluded that native Scots pine populations contain sufficient genetic diversity to evolve lower susceptibility to D. septosporum through natural selection in response to increased prevalence of this pathogen.

#Substructuring of Scots pine in Europe based on polymorphism at chloroplast microsatellite loci
#Wojkiewicz, B, Wachowiak, W
#2016
--------------------------------
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) is a forest forming tree species of great ecological and economic importance in the Northern Hemisphere. Assessment of genetic relationships between populations is needed for a better understanding of demographic and evolutionary processes of the species. We analyzed genetic variation and population structure of 24 native populations of Scots pine across its broad European distribution using a set of 13 polymorphic chloroplast simple-sequence repeats loci (cpSSRs). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 11 providing a set of 458 different haplotypes (haplotype diversity, He = 0.982). Genetic differentiation in most between-population comparisons was low (F-ST ranged from 0.00 to 0.08, R-ST ranged from 0.00 to 0.19) as expected for highly outcrossing and wind pollinated tree species. However, Bayesian clustering analysis revealed at least three distinct gehetic clusters corresponding to geographical origin of the analyzed populations. Ourresults indicate genetic substructuring across the distribution range of Scots pine, and also point to the existence of populations of most likely different history that maintain their genetic identity.

#The effect of tending and commercial thinning on the genetic diversity of Scots pine stands
#Danusevicius, D, Kerpauskaite, V, Kavaliauskas, D, Fussi, B, Konnert, M, Baliuckas, V
#2016
--------------------------------
The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of pre-commercial tending and commercial thinning on the genetic diversity parameters, especially rare allele loss and diameter-heterozygosity associations, in Scots pine stands by retrospectively modelling the removal of inferior/superior trees. Modelling was based on empirical data of DNA polymorphism in (a) a 60-year-old natural stand and (b) a 20-year-old young stand planted with seeds collected in a seed orchard. Within each of these stands, approximately 400 trees were systematically sampled within 1-ha plots (800 trees in total) and genotyped at 5 neutral and 7 EST-derived nuclear microsatellite markers. There was no significant association between heterozygosity, common allele number and tree diameter in either stand. Even at a high intensity, both simulated tending and commercial thinning had minor effects on the heterozygosity and allelic diversity but caused a significant loss of rare alleles. However, there was a nonlinear relationship between the loss of rare alleles and the thinning intensity in the young stand, such that below 30 % thinning intensity, the rare alleles were lost at a markedly lower rate. In conclusion, the association between commercial value and genetic diversity is weak in Scots pine. Thinning causes loss of rare alleles; however, for specific cases, it could be possible to identify the margins for a slow rate of rare allele loss.

#Trace element contamination differentiates the natural population of Scots pine: evidence from DNA microsatellites and needle morphology
#Chudzinska, E, Celinski, K, Pawlaczyk, EM, Wojnicka-Poltorak, A, Diatta, JB
#2016
--------------------------------
The Scots pine is often used in the biomonitoring of forests. Studies on the chemical composition plus variability of its needles morphological structure allow for an assessment of the state of environmental pollution. However, in their natural populations, the response of individual trees to stress differs. This study reports on the influence of long-term soil contamination with trace elements on the morphology of the needles, its possible relation to the differentiation of the genetic pool, and their implications for biomonitoring. In the natural and self-renewable pine stand growing near the point polluter (zinc smelter, Upper Silesia, Poland), two categories of trees are observed with respect to their health status: pollution-tolerant (T) and pollution-sensitive (S). A detailed analysis of the trace element content of the needles reveals that the concentration of Cd, Zn, Pb, and Cu in the needles is significantly higher in S as compared to T individuals. The metal accumulation pattern decidedly follows the sequence Pb > Cd > Cu > Zn. An analysis of the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of the needles reveals that sensitive trees showed an FA index ten times higher in comparison to tolerant ones. Moreover, the high differences between these S and T tree groups are also observed in the basic genetic diversity parameters investigated by an analysis of DNA simple sequence repeats (SSR). The concentration of trace elements in pine needles, distinct in sensitive and tolerant trees and in connection with their morphological and genetic characteristics, may reflect an adaptation process. The level of Mg and Fe content in the needles could be a physiological-toxicological index for evaluating trace element "lethality expressed as Mg and Fe mineral-survival strategies. The example of differences described in this Scots pine population should be taken into consideration in ecotoxicological research to better interpret the obtained results."

#Cross-amplification and multiplexing of cpSSRs and nSSRs in two closely related pine species (Pinus sylvestris L. and P. mugo Turra)
#Zukowska, WB, Wojkiewicz, B, Litkowiec, M, Wachowiak, W
#2017
--------------------------------
Background: Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are widespread molecular markers commonly used in population genetic studies. Nowadays, next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods allow identifying thousands of SSRs in one sequencing run, which greatly facilitates isolation and development of new SSRs. However, their usefulness as molecular markers still must be tested empirically on a number of populations to select SSRs with best parameters for future population genetic research. An alternative approach, cheaper and faster than isolation and characterization of new SSRs, involves cross-amplification of SSRs in closely related species. Aims: Our goal was to develop multiplex PCR protocols that will be useful in population genetic studies of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and dwarf mountain pine (P. mugo Turra), and possibly other pine species. Methods: We tested 14 chloroplast (cpSSRs) and 22 nuclear (nSSRs) microsatellite markers originally designed for Japanese black pine (P. thunbergii Parl.), P. sylvestris and loblolly pine (P. taeda L.) in four populations of P. sylvestris and P. mugo across different locations in Europe. We designed six multiplex PCRs, which were subsequently screened for their ability to provide repeatable and high quality amplification products using capillary electrophoresis. Results: The transfer rate in our study was similar in both pine species, and it was very high for cpSSRs (93% and 86% for P. sylvestris and P. mugo, respectively) and moderate for nSSRs (59% for both species). We managed to design five well-performing multiplex reactions out of six initially tested. Most of the tested loci were polymorphic. Moreover, the allelic patterns detected at some cpSSRs were species-specific. Conclusions: We provide a set of five multiplexes which can be used in genetic studies of both P. sylvestris and P. mugo. Chloroplast marker PCP30277 is a good candidate for a cheap species diagnostic marker suitable for tracking interspecific gene flow between hybridizing species of P. sylvestris and P. mugo.

#Ecology and management history drive spatial genetic structure in Scots pine
#Gonzalez-Diaz, P, Jump, AS, Perry, A, Wachowiak, W, Lapshina, E, Cavers, S
#2017
--------------------------------
Forest management practices that remove trees from stands can promote substantial changes in the distribution of genetic diversity within and among populations at multiple spatial scales. In small and isolated populations, elevated inbreeding levels might reduce fitness of subsequent generations and threaten forest resilience in the long term. Comparing fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) between life stages (e.g. adult and juvenile cohorts) can identify when populations have undergone disturbance, even in species with long generation times. Here, we studied the effects of historical and contemporary forest management, characterized by intense felling and natural regeneration respectively, on genetic diversity and fine-scale SGS in adult and juvenile cohorts. We examined fragmented Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in the Scottish Highlands, and compared them with a remote, unmanaged stand. A total of 777 trees were genotyped using 12 nuclear microsatellite markers. No difference was identified in allelic richness or gene diversity among stands or life stages, suggesting that historical and contemporary management have not impacted levels of genetic variation. However, management appears to have changed the spatial distribution of genetic variation. Adult genotypes from managed stands were more spatially structured than in the unmanaged stand, a difference mediated by contrasts in tree density, degree of fragmentation of stands at the time of establishment and rate of gap creation. Surprisingly, juveniles were less spatially structured than adults in the managed stands, suggesting an historical erosion of the structure of the adult cohort but contemporary recovery to natural dynamics, and indicating a high capacity of the species to recover after disturbance. Here we showed that using the spatial component of genetic diversity can help to detect both historical and contemporary effects of disturbance in tree populations. Evaluation of successional change is important to adequately detect early responses of tree populations to forest management practices. Overall, our study suggests that combining sustainable management with forest conservation practices that ensure larger effective population sizes is key to successfully maintaining genetic diversity in Scots pine.

#Effectiveness of the DNA barcoding approach for closely related conifers discrimination: A case study of the Pinus mugo complex
#Celinski, K, Kijak, H, Wojnicka-Poltorak, A, Buczkowska-Chmielewska, K, Sokolowska, J, Chudzinska, E
#2017
--------------------------------
DNA barcoding is a standard and efficient method, frequently used for identification, discrimination and discovery of new species. Although this approach is very useful for classifying the world's biodiversity, little is known about its usefulness in barcoding at lower taxonomic level and its discrimination rate for closely related species, like conifers. In this study, we compared the genetic variation of eight chloroplast DNA barcode regions (matK, rbcL, trnH-psbA, trnL-trnF, rpl20-rps18, trnV, ycf1, ycf2) in 17 conifers - three closely related pines from Pinus mugo complex and 14 more distant conifers representing two genera and four sections of the Pinaceae family. The discrimination rate for a single and for multiple DNA barcode regions analyzed in this study was estimated using the Tree-Building and PWG-Distance methods. The usefulness of the DNA barcoding approach for analyzing and resolving taxonomic inconsistency among closely related and more phylogenetically distant conifers was evaluated and discussed.

#Field-based artificial crossings indicate partial compatibility of reciprocal crosses between Pinus sylvestris and Pinus mugo and unexpected chloroplast DNA inheritance
#Kormutak, A, Galgoci, M, Manka, P, Koubova, M, Jopcik, M, Sukenikova, D, Bolecek, P, Gomory, D
#2017
--------------------------------
Crossability relationships between Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and mountain dwarf pine (Pinus mugo Turra) was studied, using artificial pollination approach. Partial compatibility of the reciprocal crossings of these species was proved experimentally, validating the idea of a spontaneous formation of their hybrid swarms under natural conditions. The hybrids were validated using organellar DNA markers and nuclear DNA microsatellites. Based on the percentage of filled seeds, the interspecific crossings were less efficient than the intraspecific cross-pollinations of P. sylvestris and P. mugo individuals. Both species were found to intercross readily with individuals of their putative hybrid swarm, P. mugo exhibiting a higher hybridological affinity towards putatively hybrid individuals than P. sylvestris. Validation of the hybrids confirmed the paternal inheritance of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) in the combination P. sylvestris x P. mugo only. Surprisingly, in the reciprocal crossing P. mugo x P. sylvestris, maternal inheritance of cpDNA was revealed. Obtained results offer a new insight into the direction and intensity of gene flow within the hybrid swarms of Scots pine and mountain dwarf pine.

#Genetic characteristics of Scots pine in Poland and reference populations based on nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers
#Hebda, A, Wojkiewicz, B, Wachowiak, W
#2017
--------------------------------
Polymorphisms at a set of eighteen nuclear (nSSR) and chloroplast (cpSSR) microsatellite loci were investigated in sixteen populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) derived from the provenance trial experiment and representative of the species distribution range and climatic zones in Poland. The patterns of genetic variation were compared to the reference samples from the species distribution in Europe and Asia. A similar level of genetic variation and no evidence of population structure was found among the Polish stands. They showed genetic similarity and homogenous patterns of allelic frequency spectra compared to the Northern European populations. Those populations were genetically divergent compared to the marginal populations from Turkey, Spain and Scotland. The population structure patterns reflect the phylogeography of the species and the divergence of populations that most likely do not share recent history. As the analysed provenance trial populations from Poland are diverged in phenotypic traits but are genetically similar, they could be used to test for selection at genomic regions that influence variation in quantitative traits.

#Genetic differentiation between generations of Pinus sylvestris natural population: a case study from the last European primeval forest
#Wojnicka-Poltorak, A, Celinski, K, Chudzinska, E
#2017
--------------------------------
Old stands of trees in the Bialowieza Primeval Forest in north-eastern Poland represent a primeval gene pool, which has not been subject to human selection and which maintains attributes of the ancient virgin forests that once covered central Europe. We used isozyme and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to estimate the level of genetic variation in a naturally renewed population of Pinus sylvestris, with respect to its demographic structure. Our study revealed a high level of intra-population diversity, expressed by uneven allele distribution, observed and individual heterozygosity and a very high percentage of unique multi-locus genotypes (92% for isozymes and 100% for SSR). Significant temporal changes in allele frequencies were detected between particular age classes. The observed fixation index F-IS indicated an excess of homozygotes increasing with age class. The Bayesian clustering method detected two genetic clusters: the first containing the two youngest age classes and the second containing the remaining three age classes. Our results revealed temporal dynamics of the genetic structure of the Scots pine population, probably resulting from the interaction of many factors in the past such as fluctuating reproduction episodes, gene inflow, selection and adaptation processes, and fire regimes.

#Genogeography of Pinus sylvestris L. populations in the Greater Caucasus and Crimea
#Petrova, IV, Sannikov, SN, Tembotova, FI, Sannikova, NS, Farzaliev, VS, Mollaeva, MZ, Egorov, EV
#2017
--------------------------------
Allozyme analysis of 18 Pinus sylvestris L. populations from seven landscape-geographic groups has been performed in the Greater Caucasus, Crimea, and Russian Plain. The results show that populations of the Mt. Elbrus region (isolated by high mountain ridges) are characterized by lower polymorphism and most distinct differentiation (at the level of geographic race) from other populations, which are differentiated from each other at the level of geographic groups. Genetic gradients (boundaries) between populations reach a maximum on transects across the Greater Caucasus Range, and Transcaucasian populations are more similar to populations of the Russian Plain, compared to North Caucasian populations, which confirms the hypothesis of ancestral connections between their gene pools.

#High genetic diversity and distinct origin of recently fragmented Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations along the Carpathians and the Pannonian Basin
#Toth, EG, Vendramin, GG, Bagnoli, F, Cseke, K, Hohn, M
#2017
--------------------------------
Historical evolutionary events highly affect the modern-day genetic structure of natural populations. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), as a dominant tree species of the Eurasian taiga communities following the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, has survived in small, scattered populations at the range limits of its south-eastern European distribution. In this study, we examined genetic relationships, genetic divergence and demographic history of peripheral populations from central-eastern Europe, the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Basin. Four hundred twenty-one individuals from 20 populations were sampled and characterized with both nuclear and chloroplast simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Standard population genetic indices, the degree of genetic differentiation and spatial genetic structure were analysed. Our results revealed that peripheral Scots pine populations retained high genetic diversity despite the recently ongoing fragmentation and isolation of the persisting relict populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed 7% among-population genetic differentiation, and there was no isolation by distance among the island-like occurrences. Genetic discontinuities with strong barriers (99-100% bootstrap support) were identified in the Carpathians. Based on both marker types, populations of the Western Carpathians were delimited from those inhabiting the Eastern Carpathians, and two main genetic lineages were traced that most probably originate from two main refugia. One refugium presumably existed in the region of the Eastern Alps with the Hungarian Plain, while the other was probably found in the Eastern Carpathians. These findings are supported by recent palynological records. The strongest genetic structure was revealed within the Romanian Carpathians on the basis of both marker types. With only some exceptions, no signs of recent bottlenecks or inbreeding were detected. However, Carpathian natural populations of Scots pine are highly fragmented and have a small census size, though they have not yet been affected by genetic erosion induced by isolation.

#Identification of gene pools used in restoration and conservation by chloroplast microsatellite markers in Iberian pine species
#Hernandez-Tecles, E, de las Heras, J, Lorenzo, Z, Navascues, M, Alia, R
#2017
--------------------------------
Aim of study: To contribute to the characterization of the origin of material used in afforestation, restoration or conservation activities by using Cp-SSR markers. Area of study: We used information from the natural range of Iberian pines, from Spain. Material and methods: We used Iberian pines as an example to undertook gene pool characterization based on a wide Iberian sample of 97 populations from five Pinus species (Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinaster, Pinus nigra, Pinus sylvestris and Pinus uncinata). Haplotypes from each analyzed tree (derived from nine chloroplast microsatellites markers in P. halepensis and six in the rest of the species) were obtained. Based on this information we subdivided each species in regions (considering both genetic structure and its application in afforestation, restoration and conservation programs) and tested the assignation of populations to the different groups based on the genetic distance among samples. Main results: The rate of successful identification of populations among the different species was very high (> 94 %) for P. nigra, P. sylvestris and P. uncinata, high (81 %) for P. pinaster, and low (< 65 %) for P. halepensis. Research highlights: Chloroplast DNA markers from extensive population datasets can be used to assign the origin of the forest reproductive material in some pine species.

#Phenotypic differentiation and genetic background variation of Polish provenances of Pinus sylvestris L.
#Hebda, A, Skrzyszewski, J, Wachowiak, W
#2017
--------------------------------
We looked at the patterns of differentiation at a set of phenotypic traits of Scots pine populations derived from different environmental conditions of the species distribution range in Poland. The growth traits were tested over 47 years at the provenance trial experiment in the Carpathians. The phenotypic differentiation of the populations was compared to diversity estimates at a set of ten nuclear microsatellite markers. Scots pine populations were highly differentiated concerning diameter at breast high, stand volume, stem straightness and crown width according to the provenance and climatic zones. At the same time a low genetic diversity for microsatellite markers and no evidence of population structure was found among proveniences. Local populations from the Carpathian Mountains had lower genetic variation and weaker growth compared to lowland provenances. Among the tested populations Scots pine from lowlands were characterized by the great growth potential and good adaptation to the severe climate of the Carpathians. Populations that showed high quantitative traits differentiation were genetically homogenous at the neutral loci. The results indicate that there are some regions in the genome under selection that drive species adaptive variation.

#Reconstructing the plant mitochondrial genome for marker discovery: a case study using Pinus
#Donnelly, K, Cottrell, J, Ennos, RA, Vendramin, GG, A'Hara, S, King, S, Perry, A, Wachowiak, W, Cavers, S
#2017
--------------------------------
Whole-genome-shotgun (WGS) sequencing of total genomic DNA was used to recover similar to 1 Mbp of novel mitochondrial (mtDNA) sequence from Pinus sylvestris (L.) and three members of the closely related Pinus mugo species complex. DNA was extracted from megagametophyte tissue from six mother trees from locations across Europe, and 100-bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Candidate mtDNA sequences were identified by their size and coverage characteristics, and by comparison with published plant mitochondrial genomes. Novel variants were identified, and primers targeting these loci were trialled on a set of 28 individuals from across Europe. In total, 31 SNP loci were successfully resequenced, characterizing 15 unique haplotypes. This approach offers a cost-effective means of developing marker resources for mitochondrial genomes in other plant species where reference sequences are unavailable.

#Substantial variation in the timing of pollen production reduces reproductive synchrony between distant populations of Pinus sylvestris L. in Scotland
#Whittet, R, Cavers, S, Cottrell, J, Rosique-Esplugas, C, Ennos, R
#2017
--------------------------------
The ability of a population to genetically adapt to a changing environment is contingent not only on the level of existing genetic variation within that population, but also on the gene flow received from differently adapted populations. Effective pollen-mediated gene flow among plant populations requires synchrony of flowering. Therefore differences in timing of flowering among genetically divergent populations may reduce their ability to adapt to environmental change. To determine whether gene flow among differently adapted populations of native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Scotland was restricted by differences in their flowering phenology, we measured timing of pollen release among populations spanning a steep environmental gradient over three consecutive seasons (2014-2016). Results showed that, over a distance of 137km, there were as many as 15.8days' difference among populations for the predicted timing of peak pollen shedding, with the earliest development in the warmer west of the country. There was much variation between years, with the earliest development and least synchrony in the warmest year (2014) and latest development and greatest synchrony in the coolest year (2015). Timing was negatively correlated with results from a common-garden experiment, indicative of a pattern of countergradient variation. We conclude that the observed differences in reproductive synchrony were sufficient to limit gene flow via pollen between populations of P.sylvestris at opposite ends of the environmental gradient across Scotland. We also hypothesize that continually warming, or asymmetrically warming spring temperatures will decrease reproductive synchrony among pine populations.

#Tertiary remnants and Holocene colonizers: Genetic structure and phylogeography of Scots pine reveal higher genetic diversity in young boreal than in relict Mediterranean populations and a dual colonization of Fennoscandia
#Dering, M, Kosinski, P, Wyka, TP, Pers-Kamczyc, E, Boratynski, A, Boratynska, K, Reich, PB, Romo, A, Zadworny, M, Zytkowiak, R, Oleksyn, J
#2017
--------------------------------
Aim Scots pine is one of the dominant tree species in forest ecosystems of the temperate and boreal zones in Eurasia. Since the Tertiary, it has persisted also in the Mediterranean region, forming relict populations. In this study, we investigate range-wide genetic diversity of Scots pine, aiming to provide comprehensive information on the phylogeography and genetic resources of the species. LocationEurope and Asia. Methods Thirteen paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) loci were used to investigate the genetic structure of 62 populations from Fennoscandia and 30 populations from the Mediterranean. We also surveyed variability of two maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) regions and additionally included literature data from 156 populations (248 populations in total). ResultsScots pine retains an overall high genetic diversity in the chloroplast genome but, unexpectedly, the historically younger populations from Fennoscandia showed statistically higher mean intrapopulation diversity than the Mediterranean stands (0.807 and 0.750, respectively). The latter also contained a lower number of private cpSSR haplotypes. Population differentiation with respect to mtDNA was higher (G(ST)=0.628) than at cpSSR (G(ST)=0.015) indicating an efficient pollen-mediated gene flow among refugial populations of the species. One novel haplotype mtDNA was found, increasing the number of known mitotypes for the species from 4 to 5. The geographic distribution of mitotypes was structured into four groups corresponding to the main refugial areas of the species. Main conclusions Genetic impoverishment of the Mediterranean populations may enhance their vulnerability to future environmental changes. The spatial distribution of two mitotypes in Fennoscandia, featuring predominance of mitotype a in Norway and Sweden and mitotype b in Finland, gives strong support for dual colonization of that region from south-eastern (Finland) and south-western (Sweden) directions. These results thus provide new insights into both Holocene expansion of Scots pine and the present distribution of species' genetic resources.

#A preliminary study on the genetic structure of Northern European Pinus sylvestris L. by means of neutral nuclear microsatellite markers
#Zimmer, K, Sonstebo, JH
#2018
--------------------------------
This paper aimed to investigate the genetic structure (GS) of Scots pine in the northern area of its distribution range by means of seven neutral nuclear microsatellite markers. In particular, the postglacial recolonization of these areas and possible different adaptation patterns in distinct refugia were studied. The GS and diversity were assessed with seven pairs of neutral nuclear microsatellite primers. A high genetic diversity was found in the Scots pine material tested, along with a shallow GS. This pattern is typical for recolonized areas and species with large population sizes, which are connected by pollen-mediated gene flow. A STRUCTURE analysis found two genetic groups to be the most likely, one south-eastern and one north-western group that meet in Fennoscandia. This indicates that Scots pine recolonization of Fennoscandia might have taken place from two different directions (south-west and north-east). Scots pine that recolonized the area originated in at least two different refugia during the last glacial maximum. The glacial survival in distinct refugia can have led to different adaptation patterns and growth optima in the different groups as reflected in the formation of latewood content, where lineage was a significant influencing factor.

#Cryptic genetic variation and adaptation to waterlogging in Caledonian Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris L.
#Donnelly, K, Cavers, S, Cottrell, JE, Ennos, RA
#2018
--------------------------------
Local adaptation occurs as the result of differential selection among populations. Observations made under common environmental conditions may reveal phenotypic differences between populations with an underlying genetic basis; however, exposure to a contrasting novel environment can trigger release of otherwise unobservable (cryptic) genetic variation. We conducted a waterlogging experiment on a common garden trial of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris (L.), saplings originating from across a steep rainfall gradient in Scotland. A flood treatment was maintained for approximately 1year; physiological responses were gauged periodically in terms of photochemical capacity as measured via chlorophyll fluorescence. During the treatment, flooded individuals experienced a reduction in photochemical capacity, F-v/F-m, this reduction being greater for material originating from drier, eastern sites. Phenotypic variance was increased under flooding, and this increase was notably smaller in saplings originating from western sites where precipitation is substantially greater and waterlogging is more common. We conclude that local adaptation has occurred with respect to waterlogging tolerance and that, under the flooding treatment, the greater increase in variability observed in populations originating from drier sites is likely to reflect a relative absence of past selection. In view of a changing climate, we note that comparatively maladapted populations may possess considerable adaptive potential, due to cryptic genetic variation, that should not be overlooked.

#Maternal inheritance of chloroplast DNA in Pinus mugo Turra: a case study of Pinus mugo x Pinus sylvestris crossing
#Kormutak, A, Galgoci, M, Sukenikova, D, Bolecek, P, Libantova, J, Gomory, D
#2018
--------------------------------
The opposite modes of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) inheritance were found to operate in the reciprocal crossings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and mountain dwarf pine (Pinus mugo Turra). The crossings were found to be partially compatible. In P. sylvestris x P. mugo crossing, the paternal transmission of cpDNA to the offspring takes place corroborating the generally acknowledged concept of the paternal cpDNA inheritance in gymnosperms. On the contrary, in P. mugo x P. sylvestris crossing the seed progeny exhibited P. mugo haplotype of the mother tree deviating conspicuously from the above concept. In the open pollination offspring of the putatively hybrid individuals of the Scots and mountain dwarf pines, a biparental inheritance of cpDNA was revealed in mother tree with P. mugo haplotype indicating a loosened control of the maternal inheritance of cpDNA in the putative hybrids. Implications and impacts of this finding for further studies are discussed.

#Sannikov, SN, Petrova, IV, Sannikova, NS, Egorov, EV

As a result of allozyme analysis, Nei's genetic distances were determined between the phylogeographic group of seven populations of Pinus sylvestris L. in the "glacial zone of the range in Central Yakutia and 25 populations of its hypothetical Pleistocene refugia of the southern nonglacial zone within the entire range of the species in Northern Eurasia. The location of the most likely avant-garde refugium of the modern yakutian populations of the Scots pine is Northern Priamur'e (Tynda) as well as less likely Siberian (Romanovka Irkutsk) South Ural (Kryktytau) and Central European (the Czech Republic) refugia."

#Weak isolation by distance and geographic diversity gradients persist in Scottish relict pine forest
#Gonzalez-Diaz, P, Cavers, S, Iason, GR, Booth, A, Russell, J, Jump, AS
#2018
--------------------------------
Gene flow is one of the main factors shaping genetic diversity within and among tree populations, and occurs through pollen and seed dispersal. Recent findings of pollen-release asynchronies in distant populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) within Scotland suggest that gene dispersal among more distant populations might be less effective than previously thought. Limited gene dispersal is one of the major factors causing genetic structure for neutral markers, and pollen-release asynchrony could have driven isolation by distance (IBD) among Scottish populations. Previous studies of neutral markers found little differentiation among Scottish populations of Scots pine, however they did not consider IBD over the full Scottish range. We analysed data from 6 nuclear simple sequence repeats (SSR) and 5 chloroplast SSR loci in a total of 540 individuals of Scots pine from 18 populations across Scotland. Our aim was to assess contemporary levels and distribution of genetic variation and to test if the distribution of genetic diversity was consistent with IBD. We also analysed patterns of gene flow that could have contributed to the observed patterns of variation. Levels of genetic diversity were high, for both nuclear and chloroplast markers within populations, and there was no significant differentiation among populations. A weak signal of IBD was present. We found an increase in nuclear diversity towards the East along with greater gene flow in a West-East direction commensurate with the prevailing winds. Our findings suggest that this wind-driven gene flow is dominant over genetic drift and prevents differentiation among the Scottish populations. It may also counteract any pollen-release asynchronies among populations.

#Current Approaches and Perspectives in Population Genetics of Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
#Wojkiewicz, B, Cavers, S, Wachowiak, W
#2016
--------------------------------
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is one of the most ecologically and economically important forest-forming tree species in the Northern Hemisphere. Because of value, numerous genetic studies have been conducted since the 19th century to develop or improve the breeding and conservation programs of the species. Current studies are motivated by growing concerns about the survival and productivity of Scots pine populations, especially in the face of long-term environmental change predictions. In this article, we review major questions in the population genetics of Scots pine and show how previous studies advance current research approaches. We refer to major outcomes of the research describing the genetic variation and postglacial history of Scots pine compared with those of other cold-tolerant tree species such as Norway spruce (Picea abies) and silver birch (Betula pendula). We present results from studies of quantitative trait variation and local adaptation across the Scots pine distribution. We focus on the main research directions in dissection of the genetic basis of adaptive traits and the search for signatures of selection using quantitative trait locus mapping, candidate genes, association genetics, and genome scanning approaches. Finally, we highlight novel approaches in molecular breeding and point out new research prospects in genomic studies of Scots pine and other forest tree species in the face of rapid developments in next-generation sequencing and genoiyping methods.

#Genetic variability of natural populations and man-made stands of common pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Kremenets Hills and Maloe Polese 
#Korshikov, I Lisnichuk, A Velikorid'ko, T
#2009
--------------------------------
Comparative analysis of 19 allozyme loci of Pinus sylvestris L was
 performed on three relic populations and six uneven-aged man-made
 stands to evaluate genetic variability of common pine in Kremenets
 Hills and Maloye Polesye. Low heterozygosity was characteristic of all
 natural populations and of four forest stands (H-o = 0.182-0.205),
 whereas in two forest stands the level of heterozygosity was noticeably
 higher (H-o = 0.245-0.300). Both allelic and genotypic variability of
 natural populations was reproducible in the man-made forest. However,
 the genetic distance between forest stands and natural populations was
 considerably higher than that among three natural populations (D-Nav =
 0.014 and D-Nav = 0.003, respectively).

#Genetic parameters for earlywood and latewood densities and development with increasing age in Scots pine
#Fries, A Ericsson, T
#2009
--------------------------------
Each annual ring in pines consists of earlywood and latewood with
 considerable difference in density and width. To get a better
 determination of the genetic regulation of total wood density in Scots
 pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), density and width of those ring sections
 were measured in annual ring numbers 12 to 21 of Scots pines in a
 full-sib progeny test. Tree height and stem diameter were also
 measured.
 Heritabilities for the annual ring sections increased with age for
 earlywood density from 0.08 to approximately 0.25; latewood density
 showed similar reductions. Heritability over all 10 annual rings was
 0.25 for earlywood density, 0.22 for latewood density, 0.29 for height
 and 0.10 for stem diameter. Genetic correlations between earlywood and
 latewood density and growth traits were negative, while they were
 strongly positive between densities of adjacent annual rings
 (0.70-1.0).
 Despite the higher heritability of earlywood density, the strong
 positive genetic correlation between those traits indicates little
 benefit from focusing solely on earlywood density when selecting for
 wood density. Analysing earlywood and latewood separately does not
 benefit from including the width of the corresponding ring section as a
 covariate. Juvenile wood may possibly turn into mature wood 15-20 y
 from the pith.

#Genetic variability of Italian southern Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations: the rear edge of the range 
#Scalfi, M Piotti, A Rossi, M Piovani, P
#2009
--------------------------------
Understanding the genetic structure and diversity of edge populations
 can shed light on the role of peripheral populations and their
 relevance for conservation strategies. In this study, three fragmented
 and isolated Apennine populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
 belonging to the rear edge of the species' distribution were analyzed
 using both nuclear (nSSR) and chloroplast (cpSSR) microsatellites and
 were compared with an Alpine population belonging to the species' main
 range. Although small population size and considerable isolation have
 probably reduced the genetic variability of Apennine populations, these
 fragmented populations maintain a high level of within-population
 genetic diversity. A significant among-population differentiation was
 found using both nSSR (F (ST) = 0.08) and cpSSR markers (rho = 0.14).
 Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) on the nSSRs attributed all
 variabilities to the among Apennine populations component supporting
 the theoretical predictions regarding fragmentation effects on genetic
 structure. On the other hand, AMOVA on the cpSSRs attributed all
 variances to the between-region component and no differentiation was
 found within region, among the Apennine populations. This result
 suggests the importance of pollen gene flow in homogenizing populations
 on this geographical scale. Our results confirm the genetic
 distinctiveness of Apennine populations and their possible derivation
 from different glacial refugia than those of the Alps. Considering
 their peculiarity and the high level of intrapopulation genetic
 diversity that they still retain, fragmented Apennine populations
 should be considered of high priority for conservation.

#Allozyme variation of European Black (Pinus nigra Arnold) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations and implications on their evolution: A comparative study
#Scaltsoyiannes, A Tsaktsira, M Pasagiannis, G Tsoulpha, P Zhelev, P Iliev, I Rohr, R
#2009
--------------------------------
A comparative study of the type, magnitude, and pattern of variation
 among 13 Black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) and 14 Scots pine (Pinus
 sylvestris L.) European populations was conducted by using allozyme
 markers. The evaluation of genetic diversity parameters, i.e. mean
 number of alleles per locus (A/L), effective number of alleles (Ae),
 percentage of polymorphic loci (P), expected heterozygosity per
 population (He), for the two species indicated that both Black and
 Scots pine are characterized by high levels of variation. The genetic
 differentiation coefficient (Gst) and genetic distances were higher for
 the Black pine populations. For Scots pine populations, excluding that
 of the Iberian Peninsula which seems to retain a Tertiary gene pool,
 genetic distances were low, even between populations of great
 geographical distance (Sweden-Balkan countries). The principal
 coordinate analysis and cluster analysis also confirmed the different
 genetic variation pattern of the two species. The results can be
 interpreted by the different evolutionary course of the two pine
 species, especially during the post-glacial period.

#Differences in branch characteristics of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) genetic entries grown at different spacing
#Gort J, Zubizarreta-Gerendiain A, Peltola H, Kilpelainen A, Pulkkinen P, Jaatinen R, Kellomaki S
#2010
--------------------------------
We studied the differences in branch characteristics along the stems of six different genetic entries of 20 year old Scots pines (Pious sylvestris L.) grown at different spacing (current stand density range 2000-4000 trees ha(-1)) in central Finland. Furthermore, we studied the phenotypic correlations between yield, wood density traits and branch characteristics. All the genetic entries had Kanerva pine (plus tree S1101) as a father tree, whereas the mother tree represented Finnish plus trees from southern, central and northern Finland. Spacing affected all yield traits, wood density and living branch characteristics such as relative average branch diameter and relative cumulative branch area (p < 0.05). As a comparison, genetic entry affected height, while origin group (southern, central and northern ones) affected most of the studied traits. Regardless of spacing, the northern origin had, on average, the largest stem diameter and highest wood density, while the central one was the tallest one. Furthermore, average branch diameter along the stem was affected by branch age, origin group and spacing, while average branch angle was affected by branch age and genetic entry (p < 0.05). In general the average branch size could be decreased especially in lower tree canopy by denser spacing during the early phase of the rotation, but only at the expense of tree growth. Correspondingly differences between origins are mainly related to their differences in stem growth.

#Cryptic hybrids between Pinus uncinata and P-sylvestris
#Jasinska AK, Wachowiak W, Muchewicz E, Boratynska K, Montserrat JM, Boratynski A
#2010
--------------------------------
We tested the performance of molecular markers and biometric traits in the identification of hybrids between closely related mountain pine ( Pinus uncinata) and Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris). A plastid DNA marker and a set of morphological and anatomical needle traits were applied in analyses of individuals from several sympatric stands of the species and a single-species' population from southern Europe, used as a reference. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) marker from the plastid trnL-trnF region and morphological and anatomical traits clearly discriminated between the pure species. Significant differences were found between P. uncinata and P. sylvestris, mostly in the shape of epidermal cells and the number of stomata. Four putative hybrids with P. sylvestris morphology, but with P. uncinata plastid DNA haplotypes, were found in a population from Sierra de Gudar near Valdelinares, the southernmost locality of the latter species in eastern Spain. Discrimination analyses between and within populations placed these individuals on the edge of an agglomeration of P. sylvestris individuals. The results suggest that hybridization between the species is rare, but can result in cryptic hybrids morphologically similar to the maternal species.

#Genetic diversity among populations in Scotch pine (Pinus silvestris L.) seed stands of Western Black Sea Region in Turkey
#Sevik H, Ayan S, Turna I, Yahyaoglu Z
#2010
--------------------------------
The aim of this study was to determine the differences among some of the registered seed stands in the Western Black Sea Region in Turkey by means of the morphological characters. The number of 18 morphological characters were designated by measuring and observing on seed (seed length, seed width, seed color and 1000 seed weight), juvenile seedling (root length, hypocothyl length, epycotyl length, cotyledon number, cotyledon length, stem and root dry weight) and seedling (root-collar diameter, number of branches, bud number, stem length, root length, stem and root dry weight) from 9 seed stands in the Western Black Sea Region of Turkey. The obtained data was analyzed by using cluster and penrose analysis. Cluster and penrose analysis showed that there were significant differences within the Pinus sylvestris stands for the morphologic characters.

#Genetic variation in seed and cone characteristics in a clonal seed orchard of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestis L.) grown in Kastamonu-Turkey
#Sivacioglu A
#2010
--------------------------------
Cone and seed characteristics of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were investigated in a clonal seed orchard for 2006. The orchard was established in 1995 in an area of 7.2 ha, at Taskoprii/Kastamonu, northern Turkey and includes 30 clones. The results showed that significant genetic variation exists among clones for cone wet weight and dry weight; cone width and length; total, fertile and infertile scale number; total, sound and empty seed number: 1000 seed weight; apophysis length, width and thickness; seed length and width; wing length and width; seed potential, seed efficiency and cone volume. Coefficients of variation within clones were mostly bigger than among clones, indicating high variation within the population. The respective broad sense heritability values of clone mean basis for cone dry weight, cone width. 1000 seed weight were 0.59, 0.58 and 0.57. The broad sense heritability and variation data obtained in this study are very valuable in the management practices of the existing Scots pine clonal seed orchards and can be also used for better planning of advanced generation of clonal seed orchards in Turkey.

#Evolutionary history and phylogeography of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Europe based on molecular markers
#Toth, EG, Kobolkuti, ZA, Pedryc, A, Hohn, M
#2017
--------------------------------
In this review we summarized recent historical records and molecular studies on evolutionary history and phylogeography of Scots pine with focus on the European highly fragmented distribution area of the species. Fossilized pollen, plant micro- and macrofossil records provided evidences on the large-scale species' range shifts and demographic changes during the Quaternary. Populations of Scots pine were documented both in the glacial (incl. full glaciation) and interglacial periods. Recolonization of Europe after the glaciation originated from the (Sub) Mediterranean areas like the Balkan Peninsula but also from around the Eastern Alps and the surroundings of the Danube plain. Fennoscandia and northern European Baltic regions were most probably colonized from two main directions, from Western Europe and from the Russian Plain. Modern history of Scots pine was hardly affected by anthropogenic activities that started to strengthen in the Bronze and Iron Age. Along with the fossil records, molecular genetic tools were used to infer the origin and putative history including migration, differentiation and demography of the species. In this paper we compiled the major publications (30) of molecular genetic studies of the past 20 years derived from distinctly inherited organelle genomes (mitochondrial, chloroplast, nuclear) revealed by different marker systems (mtDNA-cox1, -nad1, -nad3, -nad7, ISSR, cpSSR, nSSR, B-SAP, SNP). It is important to consider that different phylogeographic patterns can be drawn by the analysis of different DNA marker types. Accordingly the use of more than one marker simultaneously outlines the most sophisticated phylogeographical pattern on the genetic lineages and can reveal high differentiation of the European distribution. Combined marker systems and markers derived from coding sequences have also been used to detect species' phylogeographic patterns, but these were rarely applied to Scots pine. Although new molecular techniques can provide higher resolution data for populations, the reviewed results can shape the direction of further studies.

#Genetic Diversity among Age Classes of a Pinus sylvestris (L.) Population from the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland
#Wojnicka-Poltorak, A, Celinski, K, Chudzinska, E
#2017
--------------------------------
The Bialowieza Primeval Forest (BPF) is Europe's last primeval forest and an irreplaceable area for biodiversity conservation due to its size, protection status, and substantially undisturbed nature. There is no other forest in Europe with such a large surface representing highly-advanced natural succession. This article reports on the first analysis of the genetic variability and demographic structure of a self-renewed Pinus sylvestris population located in BPF, using both chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA markers. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) for chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSRs) revealed a significant genetic differentiation among age classes that accounted for about 2% of the total variance, comparable to those reported among different populations of Scots pine. None of the 117 detected chloroplast haplotypes were common to all age classes. Haplotype diversity ranged from 0.370 to 0.415 for cpSSRs and from 0.320 to 0.455 for mitochondrial markers. The genetic variation of the studied age classes-represented by mitochondrial markers-strongly depicts the maternal genetic structure, indicating limited seed dispersal. Temporal genetic substructuring is maintained within a self-renewed population of Scots pine from the BPF.

#GENETIC DIVERSITY AMONG PINUS SYLVESTRIS L. POPULATIONS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR GENETIC CONSERVATION: COMPARISON OF NUCLEAR AND CHLOROPLAST MICROSATELLITE MARKERS
#Bilgen, BB, Kaya, N
#2017
--------------------------------
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is one of the most widely distributed forest trees belonging to Pinaceae family in the world. The most southern distribution of its populations is located in Turkey. In this study, altitudinal genetic variation in P. sylvestris populations was determined via cpSSR and nSSR markers. Cones were gathered from 149 trees in five populations that represent five different elevational zones from sea level to 2250 meters in Turkey. A total of 32 alleles were determined for analyzed six cpSSR loci. The cpSSR alleles were formed 87 different haplotypes. The percentage of unique haplotypes was 65.52%. The results of AMOVA showed that the genetic diversity within populations was very high (99.8% for cpSSR and 98.3% for nSSR). Even though the studied populations are peripheral (the most southern ones in the distribution area of Scots pine), their genetic variation is still high. The results suggest that high priority should be given to peripheral populations for in situ conservation activities, as long as they have high genetic variation, because of their potential for adaptation to changing environments. The most suitable populations for forestry practices should be selected with strong emphasis on geographic location and elevation gradients.

#Genetic Diversity and Its Spatial Distribution in Self-Regenerating Norway Spruce and Scots Pine Stands
#Verbylaite, R, Pliura, A, Lygis, V, Suchockas, V, Jankauskiene, J, Labokas, J
#2017
--------------------------------
Tree genetic diversity is among the most important factors determining the sustainability of forest ecosystems. The main aim of the present study was to track possible changes in genetic diversity of regenerating populations of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in areas subjected either to a natural disturbance (windthrows and subsequent clear-cutting of the affected spruce stand) or to a changed land-use legacy (pine regeneration on abandoned agricultural land) with the aim of testing whether the new forest generation retains the genetic diversity of the putative maternal stand. Eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to reveal the genetic diversity and its spatial distribution in the studied tree populations. Self-regenerating juveniles of Norway spruce and Scots pine were spatially random and as genetically diverse as in the putative maternal populations. Genetic differentiation between putatively maternal trees and regenerating juveniles was low for both species. A high genetic diversity and random spatial genetic structure revealed in the regenerating populations provides a basis for the formation of evolutionary and ecologically sound stands able to adapt to ever-changing climatic conditions. Information on the genetic dynamics of the studied natural populations of long-lived coniferous tree species may be important for evaluating possible changes in genetic diversity at a local scale following forest ecosystem disturbances and changes in land-use legacies.

#Genetic heterogeneity underlying variation in a locally adaptive clinal trait in Pinus sylvestris revealed by a Bayesian multipopulation analysis
#Kujala, ST, Knurr, T, Karkkainen, K, Neale, DB, Sillanpaa, MJ, Savolainen, O
#2017
--------------------------------
Local adaptation is a common feature of plant and animal populations. Adaptive phenotypic traits are genetically differentiated along environmental gradients, but the genetic basis of such adaptation is still poorly known. Genetic association studies of local adaptation combine data over populations. Correcting for population structure in these studies can be problematic since both selection and neutral demographic events can create similar allele frequency differences between populations. Correcting for demography with traditional methods may lead to eliminating some true associations. We developed a new Bayesian approach for identifying the loci underlying an adaptive trait in a multipopulation situation in the presence of possible double confounding due to population stratification and adaptation. With this method we studied the genetic basis of timing of bud set, a surrogate trait for timing of yearly growth cessation that confers local adaptation to the populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Population means of timing of bud set were highly correlated with latitude. Most effects at individual loci were small. Interestingly, we found genetic heterogeneity (that is, different sets of loci associated with the trait) between the northern and central European parts of the cline. We also found indications of stronger stabilizing selection toward the northern part of the range. The harsh northern conditions may impose greater selective pressure on timing of growth cessation, and the relative importance of different environmental cues used for tracking the seasons might differ depending on latitude of origin.

#Genetic and phenotypic relationships among Pinus sylvestris populations in the Pieniny National Park
#Urbaniak, L, Lesiczka, P, Gasiorowska, E, Pawlaczyk, EM, Androsiuk, P, Lewandowska-Wosik, A, Voncina, G
#2018
--------------------------------
The phenotypic and genetic relationships among five Pinus sylvestris populations in the western part of the Carpathian Mountains were analyzed based on seven morphological needle traits and 67 loci using 10 RAPD primers. Three of the studied populations were on the western side (Macelowa Gora, Czubatka, Lazowa Skalka) and two were located in the central part (Sokolica, Zamkowa Gora) of the Pieniny National Park. The examined populations had short needles, which is characteristic for mountain habitats of the Scots pine. The populations from the Pieniny Mts. had fewer rows of stomata on both sides of the needles than others studied stands of Eurosiberian Scots pine. The number of stomata on both flat and convex sides of the needles was similar to the values observed for populations growing on the nearby Tatra Mountains. Moreover, when these two traits are considered, the populations from Sokolica and Lazowa Skalka share the highest degree of similarity. Nei's genetic distances and genetic identities between the populations were calculated on the basis of RAPD loci. The results show that the lowest Nei's distance exists between the populations from the western part of the Pieniny Mts. - Macelowa Gora and Czubatka, and its central part - Sokolica and Zamkowa Gora, with the highest values recorded between the populations of Zamkowa Gora and Czubatka, and Lazowa Skalka and Czubatka. A similar pattern of phenotypic and genetic relations that was observed between the populations in both regions of the Pieniny Mountains could be the result of planting-seed material sourced from the central Pieniny Mts. in the area of western Pieniny Mts.
