#Isozyme variation and phylogenetic relationships in Vicia subgenus Cracca (Fabaceae)
#Jaaska, V
#2005
--------------------------------
Background and Aims The phylogenetic relationships among 27 vetch species belonging to the subgenus Cracca of the genus Vicia were studied in comparison with three species of Lathyrus section Lathyrus on the basis of isozyme variation. Methods Isozymes encoded by 15 putative loci of ten enzymes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isozyme variation was analysed by using parsimony and neighbour-joining methods. Key Results The analyses revealed 63 parsimony-informative and 36 species-specific orthozymes. Of the latter, 23 are monomophic and are suitable for identification of V. benghalensis, V. palaestina, V. dumetorum, V. pisiformis, V. sylvatica, V. onobrychioides, V. cappadocica, V. cretica, V. articulata, V. tetrasperma, V. ervilia, V. hirsuta and V. loiseleurii. Polymorphism with heterozygous and homozygous isozyme genotypes was found for V. cracca, V. tenuifolia, V. ochroleuca, V. villosa, V. sylvatica, V. cassubica, V. sparsiflora, V. megalotropis, V. altissima, V. onobrychioides, V. cassia, V. cretica and L. heterophyllus, reflecting outcrossing in these species. By contrast, V. benghalensis, V. palaestina, V. disperma, V. dumetorum, V. pisiformis, V. orobus, V. pauciflora, V. tetrasperma and V. loiseleurii had only homozygous isozyme genotypes at polymorphic loci. Isozyme-based phylogenetic trees are presented. Conclusions Sections Cracca, Ervum, Pedunculatae and Lenticula of traditional taxonomy are monophyletic groups, whereas sections Oroboideae (= Vicilla) and Panduratae appear polyphyletic and section Cassubicae is split into two species-couples linked at a low level of support. Treatment of ervoid species in a separate subgenus Ervum is not supported because of its polyphyly.

#Genetic diversity and population structure of wild lentil tare.

--------------------------------
Genetic diversity has been studied extensively in the cultivated faba bean (Vicia faba L.). Compared with other ecologically and economically significant herbaceous species, population structure of lentil tare, Vicia tetrasperma (L.) Schreber (Leguminosae), has not been studied. The objectives of this study were to estimate the level of genetic diversity in the species and to describe how its genetic variation is distributed within and among its populations. The percentage of polymorphic loci was 50.0%. Genetic diversity was high at both the species and population levels (Hes = 0.171; Hep = 0.158), whereas the extent of the population divergence was relatively low (G(st) = 0.116). In the hierarchical analysis, a great amount of variance was exhibited among populations with respect to regions (Fxy = 0.266) and a large component of the value was explained by variance among regions with respect to the total (Fxy = 0.132). The results were consistent with the strong geographic effect indicated by unweighted pair-wise groups method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) and Mantel's test. The correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance by Mantel's test was high and significant (r = 0.597). F-is, a measure of the deviation from random mating within populations, was 0.503, indicating that V. tetrasperma is an inbreeding species. An indirect estimate of the number of migrants per generation (N-m = 1.90) indicated that gene flow was high among populations. Nearly 88.4% of the total genetic diversity in V. tetrasperma was apportioned within populations. The wide geographic ranges, wild condition of the species, and high fecundity are proposed as possible factors contributing to high genetic diversity.
