#A direct regional scale estimate of transgene movement from genetically modified oilseed rape to its wild progenitors
#Wilkinson, MJ,  Davenport, IJ,  Charters, YM,  Jones, AE,   Allainguillaume, J,   Butler, HT,   Mason, DC and   Raybould, AF
#2000
--------------------------------
One of the major environmental concerns over genetically modified (GM) crops relates to transgene movement into wild relatives. The pattern of  hybridization ultimately affects the scale and rapidity of ecological
   change and the feasibility of containment. A new procedure for
   quantifying hybrid formation over large areas is described. Remote
   sensing was used to identify possible sites of sympatry between
   Brassica napus and ifs progenitor species across 15 000 km(2) of
   south-east England in 1998. Two sympatric populations with B. rapa and
   one with B. oleracea were found over the entire survey area. Every
   newly recruited plant in these populations in 1999 was screened for
   hybrid status using now cytometry and molecular analyses. One hybrid
   was observed from the 505 plants screened in the B. rapa populations
   but none of the nine B. oleracea recruits were hybrids. Measures to
   minimize gene now are suggested, and a procedure for the post-release
   evaluation and containment of GM cultivars is proposed.
