#Mixed mating system in the fern Asplenium scolopendrium: implications for colonization potential

--------------------------------
Human-mediated environmental change is increasing selection pressure for the capacity in plants to colonize new areas. Habitat fragmentation combined with climate change, in general, forces species to colonize areas over longer distances. Mating systems and genetic load are important determinants of the establishment and long-term survival of new populations. Here, the mating system of Asplenium scolopendrium, a diploid homosporous fern species, is examined in relation to colonization processes. A common environment experiment was conducted with 13 pairs of sporophytes, each from a different site. Together they constitute at least nine distinct genotypes, representing an estimated approx. 95 % of the non-private intraspecific genetic variation in Europe. Sporophyte production was recorded for gametophytes derived from each parent sporophyte. Gametophytes were grown in vitro in three different ways: (I) in isolation, (II) with a gametophyte from a different sporophyte within the same site or (III) with a partner from a different site. Sporophyte production was highest in among-site crosses (III), intermediate in within-site crosses (II) and was lowest in isolated gametophytes (I), strongly indicating inbreeding depression. However, intragametophytic selfing was observed in most of the genotypes tested (eight out of nine). The results imply a mixed mating system in A. scolopendrium, with outcrossing when possible and occasional selfing when needed. Occasional intragametophytic selfing facilitates the successful colonization of new sites from a single spore. The resulting sporophyte, which will be completely homozygous, will shed large amounts of spores over time. Each year this creates a bed of gametophytes in the vicinity of the parent. Any unrelated spore which arrives is then selectively favoured to reproduce and contribute its genes to the new population. Thus, while selfing facilitates initial colonization success, inbreeding depression promotes genetically diverse populations through outcrossing. The results provide further evidence against the overly simple dichotomous distinction of fern species as either selfing or outcrossing.

#Genetic analysis of the threatened American hart's-tongue fern (Asplenium scolopendrium var. americanum [Fernald] Kartesz and Gandhi): Insights into its mating system and implications for conservation

--------------------------------
American hares-tongue fern (AHTF) is one of the rarest ferns in the United States and concern over its conservation and management has highlighted the need for genetic analysis. Genetic analysis also provides insights into the species' mating system which contributes to our understanding of its rarity and persistence. We analyzed 88 individuals from 11 populations in NY and MI based on variations in 108 loci as revealed through ISSR markers using Nei's gene diversity index, percent polymorphic loci and other measures. Low genetic diversity predominates in the populations from NY, and even lower for the populations in MI. Our results also indicate that AHTF from NY and MI are genetically differentiated from each other, as well as the populations within them. There is no positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances, as well as between genetic distance and census population size. The significantly high among population genetic variation and low gene flow value are common indicators of a predominant inbreeding mating strategy within populations, limited spore dispersal, and genetic drift. Our results also indicate that each AHTF population is an important contributor to the overall genetic variation of the species and thus, represents a significant unit for conservation efforts.
