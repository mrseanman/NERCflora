#Comparison of natural and artificial hybridization in Potamogeton
#Kaplan, Z, Fehrer, J
#2006
--------------------------------
The first attempt to artificially hybridize species of Potamogeton resulted in the hybrid P. perfoliatus x P. gramineus. The morphological features, reproductive behaviour and molecular markers of the offspring of this experimental hybridization were compared with those of the parental species and natural hybrids of the same assumed parentage. A phenotype corresponding to that of the natural hybrid R x nitens was acquired from an experimental cross between P. perfoliatus and P. gramineus. All plants, both natural and artificial, of this hybrid were consistently sterile. They showed the ITS variants of both parental taxa, which is consistent with biparental inheritance of nuclear DNA. The experimental hybrid was used to test the maternal inheritance of chloroplast DNA in Potamogeton. Sequences of a chloroplast intergenic spacer (rpl20-rps12) were identical with those of the female parent. Then, the directions of the crosses resulting in the natural hybrids were investigated. Of five natural populations of P. x nitens, P. gramineus was the maternal parent of two and P. perfoliatus of three populations. The frequency of hybridization events and rise of hybrids are discussed.

# Identification of hybrids in broad-leaved Potamogeton species (Potamogetonaceae) in China using nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequence data

--------------------------------
Hybridization is relatively frequent in the pondweed genus Potamogeton. A total of five putative hybrids of broad-leaved Potamogeton in China were collected in our recent investigations. We used internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast rbcL gene sequences to confirm the origins of the putative hybrids. Using ITS sequence additivity, we confirmed that the five putative hybrids were P. x anguillanus Koidzumi (P. wrightii x P. perfoliatus), P. x malainoides Miki (P. distinctus x P. wrightii), P. distinctus x P. nodosus, P. nodosus x P. wrightii, and P. distinctus x P. gramineus. The latter four hybrids are new records for China, and P. distinctus x P. gramineus is a new hybrid combination in Potamogeton. We found a new genotype of P. perfoliatus in northeast China. Hybrids between the new and a common genotype of P. perfoliatus were found in Central China. The maternal parents of the six hybrids were confirmed by chloroplast rbcL gene sequence data. The hybrids P. x anguillanus and P. distinctus x P. gramineus are reciprocal hybrids. P. x anguillanus has multiple origins from different populations. P. distinctus x P. gramineus has multiple origins within a single population.

#Identification of Hybrids in Potamogeton: Incongruence between Plastid and ITS Regions Solved by a Novel Barcoding Marker PHYB

--------------------------------
Potamogeton is one of the most difficult groups to clarify in aquatic plants, which has an extensive range of interspecific morphological and ecological diversity. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is prevalent for phylogenetic analysis in plants. However, most researches demonstrate that ITS has a high percentage of homoplasy in phylogenetic datasets. In this study, eighteen materials were collected in Potamogeton from China and incongruence was shown between the rbcL and ITS phylogenies. To solve the discrepancy, we employed a novel barcode PHYB to improve resolution and accuracy of the phylogenetic relationships. The PHYB phylogeny successfully resolved the incongruence between the rbcL and ITS phylogenies. In addition, six hybrids were confirmed using PHYB, including P. compressus x P pusillus, P. octandrus x P. oxyphyllus, P. gramineus x P. lucens, P. distinctus x P. natans, P. distinctus x P. wrightii, and S. pectinata x S. amblyophylla. Whereas, only one hybrid was identified (P. compressus x P. pusillus) by ITS, indicating that ITS homoplasy was present in Potamogeton and ITS was completely homogenized to one parental lineage. Thus, ITS might have limited utility for phylogenetic relationships in Potamogeton. It is recommended that a three-locus combination of chloroplast DNA gene, ITS and PHYB is potential to effectively reveal more robust phylogenetic relationships and species identification.
