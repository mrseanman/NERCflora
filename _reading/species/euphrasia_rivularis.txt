#The relationship between flower size, inbreeding coefficient and inferred selfing rate in British Euphrasia species.
#French GC, Ennos RA, Silverside AJ and Hollingsworth PM
#2005
--------------------------------
The genus Euphrasia in Britain comprises a taxonomically complex group of self-compatible, morphologically similar, hemi-parasitic, annual plant species of high conservation importance. The 19 diploid and tetraploid taxa currently recognised show striking variation in flower size. The objective of this paper is to determine whether a relationship exists between flower size and breeding system within Euphrasia. Following a survey of flower size variation among the 19 taxa, seven diploid populations, encompassing a broad range of flower sizes, were selected for detailed study. Four nuclear microsatellite loci were used to estimate the inbreeding coefficient Fis within each population. Fis values varied from to 0.17 to 0.77 and showed a significant, negative correlation with flower size. These results are best explained as the consequence of variation in selfing rate among the Euphrasia populations, with selfing rate increasing as flower size decreases. Potential factors influencing breeding system evolution in Euphrasia are discussed, together with the role of autogamy in generating taxonomic complexity and facilitating lineage differentiation within the genus.

#Genetics, taxonomy and conservation of British Euphrasia
#French GC, Hollingsworth PM, Silverside AJ, Ennos RA

--------------------------------
n Britain the genus Euphrasia comprises ca 20 diploid and tetraploid plant species, including several endemics. However, their conservation is impeded by taxonomic uncertainty. Analysis of cpDNA and AFLP variation was used to assess their taxonomic status and establish the extent of barriers to gene exchange among them. Differences in ploidy level constitute a very strong barrier to genetic exchange, although this is not absolute. The diploid endemics E. vigursii and E. rivularis form morphologically and genetically definable units which show some level of reproductive isolation. Within tetraploid Euphrasia, the species showed varying degrees of distinctness. Analysis of geographically paired samples from two widespread outcrossing taxa E. arctica and E. nemorosa provides evidence for extensive genetic exchange between them. However AFLP data indicate that this outbreeding species complex possesses a gene pool distinct from that of the widespread inbreeding tetraploids. The widespread and endemic inbreeding tetraploids contain examples of morphologically and genetically definable taxa, but also species whose distinctness is more equivocal. The conservation implications of this study are that species-based action plans are potentially suitable for conservation of the diploid endemics E. vigursii and E. rivularis. In contrast we contend that a species-based conservation framework, developed with reproductively isolated and genetically distinct groups in mind, requires modification for conservation of the complex and dynamic diversity found within the tetraploids. The adoption of ‘taxonomic’ action plans, designed to protect the evolutionary processes generating Euphrasia diversity, may provide a supplementary solution for conserving this type of variation.

#Isolation of polymorphic microsatellite markers for British Euphrasia L.
#French, GC, Hollingsworth, PM and Ennos, RA
#2003
--------------------------------
Euphrasia species in Britain attract a large amount of conservation attention due to the recognition of numerous endemic taxa in what is essentially a species-poor flora. To develop a set of research tools to investigate the evolutionary processes underlying this diversification , a membrane enrichment procedure has been used to isolate five polymorphic microsatellite loci from Euphrasia nemorosa (Pers.) Wallr. These loci amplify polymorphic products in several other British Euphrasia species.
