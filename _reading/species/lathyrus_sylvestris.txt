#Isozymic polymorphism and phylogeny of 10 Lathyrus species.
#Ben Brahim, N, Salhi, A, Chtourou, N, Combes, D, Marrakchi, M
#2002
--------------------------------
Isozyme variation and phylogenetic relationships between ten annual and perennial Lathyrus species: L. aphaca, L. articulatus, L. cicera, L. hirsutus, L. latifolius, L. nissolia, L. odoratus, L. ochrus, L. sativus and L. sylvestris were studied. Four enzyme systems, leucine-amino-peptidase (LAP), 6-phosphogluconate deshydrogenase ( 6-PGD), glutamate oxalo-acetate transaminase (GOT) and phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) were analyzed, using gel electrophoresis. Five polymorphic loci were detected and eleven alleles were identified at these loci. Zymogram data revealed that almost all-present species studied exhibited isozyme polymorphism. L. latifolius and L. sylvestris maintain high levels of isozyme diversity, which is probably associated with the perenniality of these two species and their predominantly outcrossing reproduction system. In contrast, the low level of genetic diversity observed in other species is attributed to their breeding systems. These species are annuals and have higher proportions of selfing. The distribution of genetic variation within and among species showed large genetic differences between the analysed species. PGD-1 and PGD-2 loci contributed the most to the distinction between species. GOT-2, LAP-1 and PGI-1 loci contributed to the distinction within species. The low level of gene flow revealed could be partly related to the high level of autogamy in the majority of species. The regroupement of species revealed by Nei's genetic similarity agrees only in parte with Kupicha's classification based on morphological characters. Thus, these isozymic markers are important in germplasm collection and conservation.

#The evolving genetic history of a population of Lathyrus sylvestris: Evidence from temporal and spatial genetic structure.
#HossaertMcKey, M, Valero, M, Magda, D, Jarry, M, Cuguen, J, Vernet, P
#1996
--------------------------------
We analyze patterns of genetic microdifferentiation within a natural population of Lathyrus sylvestris, a perennial herb with both sexual reproduction and clonal growth. In a population from the northern foothills of the Pyrenees in southwestern France, a combined demographic and genetic investigation enabled the study not only of spatial genetic structure of the population, but also of the history of the population's spatial genetic structure over time. Excavation of all individuals allowed identification of clonemates. Age of each individual was determined by counting annual growth rings in the taproot, a method tested with individuals of known age planted in experimental gardens. Each individual was mapped, and genotypes of all individuals were determined using allozyme markers for a number of polymorphic loci. Distribution patterns and spatial genetic structure, both for all individuals and for different age classes, were analyzed using spatial autocorrelation statistics (Geary's Index, Moran's Index). Patterns of gene flow within the population were also studied using F-statistics and tests for random associations of alleles. Because age, allele frequencies, and location were known for each individual, it was possible to study how spatial genetic structure changed over lime. Results from all these diverse approaches are consistent with one another, and clearly show the following: (1) founder effects, with the study transect being first colonized by individuals at either end of the transect that were homozygous for different alleles at one marker locus; (2) a difference in spatial distribution of individuals originated from sexual reproduction (seedlings) and from clonal growth (connected individuals); (3) restricted gene flow, due to inbreeding among related, clumped individuals; and (4) increase in heterozygote deficit within the youngest cohort of individuals. The results indicate that genetic differentiation in time was much less marked than differentiation in space. Nevertheless, the results revealed that the studied population is experiencing demographic and genetic variation in time, suggesting that it is not at equilibrium. On the one hand, spatial structuring is becoming less marked due to the recombination of founder genotypes; on the other hand, as establishment of new individuals increases, a new spatial structure emerges due to mating between relatives.

#Genetic variation analysis in the genus Lathyrus using RAPD markers.
#Chtourou-Ghorbel, N, Lauga, B, Ben Brahim, N, Combes, D, Marrakchi, M
#2002
--------------------------------
RAPD analysis was applied to five species belonging to the genus Lathyrus (Fabaceae): L. sativus, L. cicera, L. ochrus, L. sylvestris and L. latifolius. All the species under study belong to the section Lathyrus except L. ochrus which is in section Clymenum. Nine populations representing these species were used and ten random 10-mer primers were sampled. A total of 129 amplification products, ranging in size from 0.3 to 3 Kb, were generated. Partitioning of variation was studied using the AMOVA technique. The genetic variation proved to be nearly equally distributed among species and among populations within species. A similar approach was carried out to distinguish populations, which proved to be efficient. The between population dissimilarities were calculated and a dendrogram of genetic relationships was drawn. The RAPDs obtained were sufficient to distinguish between the two accessions of a species and to separate these accessions by clustering them according to species. A high genetic similarity between the populations of L. sylvestris and L. latifolius was established. A similar result is also shown for the populations of L. sativus and L. cicera.
