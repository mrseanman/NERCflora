#Polymorphic nuclear markers for coastal plant species with dynamic geographic distributions, the rock samphire (Crithmum maritimum) and the vulnerable dune pansy (Viola tricolor subsp curtisii)

--------------------------------
Identifying spatial patterns of genetic differentiation across a species range is critical to set up conservation and restoration decision-making. This is especially timely, since global change triggers shifts in species' geographic distribution and in the geographical variation of mating system and patterns of genetic differentiation, with varying consequences at the trailing and leading edges of a species' distribution. Using 454 pyrosequencing, we developed nuclear microsatellite loci for two plant species showing a strictly coastal geographical distribution and contrasting range dynamics: the expanding rock samphire (Crithmum maritimum, 21 loci) and the highly endangered and receding dune pansy (Viola tricolor subsp. curtisii, 12 loci). Population genetic structure was then assessed by genotyping more than 100 individuals from four populations of each of the two target species. Rock samphire displayed high levels of genetic differentiation (F (ST) = 0.38), and a genetic structure typical of a mostly selfing species (F (IS) ranging from 0.16 to 0.58). Populations of dune pansy showed a less pronounced level of population structuring (F (ST) = 0.25) and a genotypic structure more suggestive of a mixed-mating system when excluding two loci with heterozygote excess. These results demonstrate that the genetic markers developed here are useful to assess the mating system of populations of these two species. They will be tools of choice to investigate phylogeographical patterns and variation in mating system over the geographical distribution ranges for two coastal plant species that are subject to dynamic evolution due to rapid contemporary global change.

#Increased genetic diversity of Viola tricolor L. (Violaceae) in metal-polluted environments
#Slomka A, Sutkowska A, Szczepaniak M, Malec P, Mitka J, Kuta E
#2011
--------------------------------
Changes in DNA sequences affecting cryptic intraspecific variability are very important mechanisms of plant microevolutionary processes, initiating species diversification. In polluted environments, intra- and interpopulation changes at the molecular level proceed rapidly and lead to the formation of new ecotypes in a relatively short time. We used ISSR PCR fingerprinting data to analyze the genetic diversity and genetic structure of seven populations of Viola tricolor: four growing on soil contaminated with heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cd; waste heaps) and three from control soil. The populations from the polluted sites showed higher genetic polymorphism (%(poly) = 84%) and gene diversity (H(T) = 0.1709) than the control populations (%(poly) = 75% and H(T) = 0.1448). The number of private markers we detected within metallicolous (MET) populations was more than double that found within non-metallicolous (NON) populations (15 vs. 7). The STRUCTURE and UPGMA analyses showed clear genetic differences between the NON and MET populations. Based on broad analyses of the genetic parameters, we conclude that the effect of these polluted environments on the genetic diversity of the MET populations, separating them from the NON populations, is evidence of microevolutionary processes at species level, leading to species divergence and the emergence of local ecotypes better adapted to their different environments.

#Effects of soil pH and phosphorus on in vitro pollen competitive ability and sporophytic traits in clones of Viola tricolor.
#Lankinen, A
#2000
--------------------------------
Greenhouse-grown clones of Viola tricolor were used to evaluate the importance of genetic effects on in vitro pollen tube growth rate in relation to the influence of two environmental soil factors-pH and phosphorus content. After 1 mo in different soil treatments, individual pollen tube growth rate was affected by a genotype by phosphorus interaction, while it was unaffected by either main effects. Though individuals differed in their response to phosphorus availability, the rank order of pollen donors remained consistent between treatments; i.e., the pollen donors with the highest pollen tube growth rate were the same in all soil conditions. Sporophytic traits were also affected by a genotype by phosphorus interaction. The response of pollen growth and sporophytic traits to soil phosphorus content were correlated within individuals in the high pH treatments. These results, in combination with a high value of clonal repeatability of pollen tube growth rate, indicate that pollen competitive ability has a genetic basis in this species. One prerequisite for this trait to have evolutionary effects on male fitness is thus fulfilled. Furthermore, if the response to phosphorus among pollen donors is more pronounced under natural conditions, variation in this environmental factor within populations has the potential to maintain some genetic Variation in pollen tube growth rate even if this trait is constantly selected.
