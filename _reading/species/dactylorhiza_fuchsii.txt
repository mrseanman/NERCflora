#Reproductive isolation and hybridization in sympatric populations of three Dactylorhiza species (Orchidaceae) with different ploidy levels

--------------------------------
The potential for gene exchange between species with different ploidy levels has long been recognized, but only a few studies have tested this hypothesis in situ and most of them focused on not more than two co-occurring species. In this study, we examined hybridization patterns in two sites containing three species of the genus Dactylorhiza (diploid D. incarnata and D. fuchsii and their allotetraploid derivative D. praetermissa). To compare the strength of reproductive barriers between diploid species, and between diploid and tetraploid species, crossing experiments were combined with morphometric and molecular analyses using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, whereas flow cytometric analyses were used to verify the hybrid origin of putative hybrids. In both sites, extensive hybridization was observed, indicating that gene flow between species is possible within the investigated populations. Bayesian assignment analyses indicated that the majority of hybrids were F-1 hybrids, but in some cases triple hybrids (hybrids with three species as parents) were observed, suggesting secondary gene flow. Crossing experiments showed that only crosses between pure species yielded a high percentage of viable seeds. When hybrids were involved as either pollen-receptor or pollen-donor, almost no viable seeds were formed, indicating strong post-zygotic reproductive isolation and high sterility. Strong post-mating reproductive barriers prevent local breakdown of species boundaries in Dactylorhiza despite frequent hybridization between parental species. However, the presence of triple hybrids indicates that in some cases hybridization may extend the F-1 generation.

#Patterns of chloroplast diversity among western European Dactylorhiza species (Orchidaceae).
#Devos, N, Tyteca, D, Raspe, O, Wesselingh, RA, Jacquemart, AL
#2003
--------------------------------
In Europe, the genus Dactylorhiza comprises a bewildering variety of forms that are difficult to sort into discrete species. Most Dactylorhiza species are diploid or tetraploid and contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to explain the complex variation within this group. Using PCR-RFLP analysis in eight putative species, we could identify four highly differentiated chloroplast DNA lineages. The first lineage (clade A) included the unique haplotype found in D. sambucina. Clade B grouped four haplotypes belonging mostly to D. incarnata. Clades C and D included 27 haplotypes detected in diploid D. fuchsii and in all tetraploid species investigated. Eighty percent of the chloroplast variation were consistent with currently accepted species boundaries. The imperfect agreement between chloroplast variation and species boundaries may be ascribed to incomplete lineage sorting and/or reticulation. Our cpDNA results provide strong evidence that the allotetrapolyploids have been formed through asymmetric hybridization with a member of the D. fuchsii / maculata group as the maternal parent.

#Systematics of the Dactylorhiza euxina/incarnata/maculata polyploid complex (Orchidaceae) in Turkey: evidence from allozyme data.
#Hedren, M
#2001
--------------------------------
Material of Dactylorhiza were sampled from 49 localities in Turkey and investigated for allozyme variation at ten loci (nine enzyme systems). Among diploids, the Anatolian D. osmanica and D. umbrosa were allozymically variable, but not distinct from each other or from D. incarnata. Dactylorhiza saccifera contained the same alleles as the European D. fuchsii. Dactylorhiza iberica and D. euxina were distinct from each other and the other diploids. On basis of allozyme patterns three distinct allotetraploid genotypes were distinguished, and each of them could be treated as a separate species. Dactylorhiza nieschalkiorum is similar to European allotetraploids, and may have arisen from hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. and D. saccifera. Dactylorhiza urvilleana may have arisen from parents related to present-day D. saccifera and D. euxina, but it also contains additional alleles that have not been found in any of the diploids investigated.  third allotetraploid known from four populations in the Ardahan and Kars provinces of north-eastern Turkey combines the allozyme patterns found in material of D. incarnata s.l. from the same area with those from D. euxina. It is here described for the first time as D. armeniaca.

#The evolution of Dactylorhiza (Orchidaceae) allotetraploid complex: Insights from nrDNA sequences and cpDNA PCR-RFLP data
#Devos, N, Raspe, O, Oh, SH, Tyteca, D, Jacquemart, AL
#2006
--------------------------------
Sequence data from a portion of the external transcribed spacer (ETS)and from the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA were used together with chloroplast DNA PCR-RFLP data to unravel patterns of allotetraploid speciation within theWestern European Dactylorhiza polyploid complex. A maximum likelihood tree based on combined ETS and ITS sequences suggests that the Western European Dactylorhiza allotetraploids have evolved by hybridizationbetween four main diploid lineages. Cloned sequences and the topologyof the ITS plus ETS tree indicate that the allotetraploid species D.elata, D. brennensis, and D. sphagnicola have originated from the autotetraploid D. maculata together with the diploid D. incarnata,while D. majalis, D. traunsteineri, and D. angustata seem to haveevolved by hybridization between the D. fuchsii s.str and D. incarnata lineages. Finally, the diploid D. saccifera lineage seems to have beeninvolved together with the D. incarnata lineage in the formation of the allotetraploid D. praetermissa. The observed congruence between the chloroplast tree and the ITS/ETS tree suggests a directional evolution of the nrDNA after polyploidization in favor of the maternal genome.Considered together with morphological, biogeographical, and ecological evidence, the molecular analysis leads us to recognize four species within the investigated allotetraploid complex, namely D. majalis, D.praetermissa, D. elata, and D. sphagnicola.

#Polyploid evolution and plastid DNA variation in the Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata complex (Orchidaceae) in Scandinavia
#Hedren, M Nordstrom, S Stahlberg, D
#2008
--------------------------------
The Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata complex (Orchidaceae) was used as a model system to understand genetic differentiation processes in a naturally occurring polyploid complex with much of ongoing diversification and wide distribution in recently glaciated areas in northern Europe. Data were obtained for 12 hypervariable regions in the plastid DNA genome. A total of 166 haplotypes were found in a sample of 1099 plants. Allopolyploid taxa have inherited their plastid genomes from D. maculata s.l. Overall haplotype diversity of the combined group of allopolyploid taxa was comparable to that of maternal D. maculata s.l., but populations of allopolyploids were also more strongly differentiated from each other and contained lower numbers of haplotypes than populations of D. maculata s.l. In addition to haplotypes found in extant D. maculata s.l., the allopolyploids also contained several distinct and widespread haplotypes that were not found in any of the parental lineages. Some of these haplotypes were shared between widespread allopolyploids. Divergent allopolyploids with small distributions did not seem to originate from local polyploidization events, but rather as segregates of already existing allopolyploids. Genetic diversification of allopolyploid Dactylorhiza is the result of repeated polyploid formation, secondary hybridization and introgression between already existing polyploids and extant representatives of parental lineages, hybridization between independently derived polyploid lineages, and phyletic diversification in the group of allopolyploids. Although some polyploid taxa must have evolved after the last glaciation, genetic material from the parental lineages has been transferred continuously for longer periods of time. This combination of processes may explain the taxonomic complexity encountered in Dactylorhiza and other polyploid complexes distributed in previously glaciated parts of Europe.

#Genetic differentiation and admixture between sibling allopolyploids in the Dactylorhiza majalis complex
#Balao, F, Tannhauser, M, Lorenzo, MT, Hedren, M, Paun, O

--------------------------------
Morphological and allozyme analyses of Siberian dactylorchids have revealed the presence of a new, previously undescribed allopolyploid that is described here as species new to science. The genetic constitution as revealed by allozyme analysis of this species confirms that its parents are the diploid Siberian D. fuchsii and D. incarnata, and it is 2n=80, representing the first such count from the Asiatic Russia. In most literature surveys of Siberia, the new species has been identified as D. baltica, which is different in the allele composition of the pgi locus. Morphologically, both allotetraploids are similar; D. sibirica is distinguishable due to the absence of spots on the leaves and a narrower lip with narrower lateral lobes. A brief summary of Dactylorhiza allopolyploids from Siberia (Russia) is presented.
