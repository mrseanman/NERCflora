#Genetic diversity and population structure in the outcrossing populations of Equisetum arvense and E.hyemale (Equisetaceae).
#Korpelainen, H, Kolkkala, M
#1996
--------------------------------
An allozyme examination was conducted to study the mating systems and genetic differentiation of populations of Equisetum arvense and E. hyemale. The study revealed that the rate of intragametophytic selfing in these homosporous pteridophytes is very low, i.e., on average 0.020 and 0.019, respectively, despite the potential hermaproditism and selling of the gametophytes. Most populations consisted of numerous genotypes, and the average heterozygosities of E. arvense and E. hyemale equalled 0.092 and 0.134, respectively. The commonly observed excess of the heterozygote genotypes indicates that there are interclonal differences in the frequency of vegetative reproduction. The level of genetic divergence among populations was considerable even within a limited geographic area. It is suggested that the life history of Equisetum, characterized by the inefficiency of spore germination and gametophyte reproduction in noncolonizing situations, limits the level of gene flow and leads to a great genetic divergence between populations.

#Equisetum (Equisetaceae) species or hybrids? ISSR fingerprinting profiles help improve diagnoses based on morphology and anatomy
#Brune, T Thiv, M Haas, K
#2008
--------------------------------
The applicability of "inter-simple sequence repeats" (ISSR)-PCR as a molecular character complex for differentiation of Equisetum taxa is described with a special focus on the detection of hybrids. All Central European Equisetum species and the four most frequent hybrids are considered: E. arvense, E. fluviatile, E. telmateia, E. palustre, E. sylvaticum, E. pratense, E. x litorale, E. ramosissimum, E. hyemale, E. variegatum, E. x moorei, E. x trachyodon and E. x meridionale. The ISSR banding patterns are highly typical for each species. The positions of the clusters of hybrid taxa prove their hybrid origin and enable identification of the parental species. Genetic similarities of populations suggest that in some species vegetative reproduction predominates (e.g. E. arvense), whereas for others (e.g. E. telmateia) sexual reproduction seems to be more frequent. In addition to the molecular analyses, the characteristics of stem cross sections of the four hybrids and their parental species are shown and discussed.

#Identification of common horsetail (Equisetum arvense L.; Equisetaceae) using Thin Layer Chromatography versus DNA barcoding
#Saslis-Lagoudakis, C. Haris, Bruun-Lund, Sam, Iwanycki, Natalie E., Seberg, Ole, Petersen, Gitte, Jager, Anna K., Ronsted, Nina
#2015
--------------------------------
The global herbal products market has grown in recent years, making regulation of these products paramount for public healthcare. For instance, the common horsetail (Equisetum arvense L.) is used in numerous herbal products, but it can be adulterated with closely related species, especially E. palustre L. that can produce toxic alkaloids. As morphology-based identification is often difficult or impossible, the identification of processed material can be aided by molecular techniques. In this study, we explore two molecular identification techniques as methods of testing the purity of these products: a Thin Layer Chromatography approach (TLC-test) included in the European Pharmacopoeia and a DNA barcoding approach, used in recent years to identify material in herbal products. We test the potential of these methods for distinguishing and identifying these species using material from herbarium collections and commercial herbal products. We find that both methods can discriminate between the two species and positively identify E. arvense. The TLC-test is more cost-and time-efficient, but DNA barcoding is more powerful in determining the identity of adulterant species. Our study shows that, although DNA barcoding presents certain advantages, other established laboratory methods can perform as well or even better in confirming species' identity in herbal products.
