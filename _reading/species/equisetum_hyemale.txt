#Genetic diversity and population structure in the outcrossing populations of Equisetum arvense and E.hyemale (Equisetaceae).
#Korpelainen, H, Kolkkala, M
#1996
--------------------------------
An allozyme examination was conducted to study the mating systems and genetic differentiation of populations of Equisetum arvense and E. hyemale. The study revealed that the rate of intragametophytic selfing in these homosporous pteridophytes is very low, i.e., on average 0.020 and 0.019, respectively, despite the potential hermaproditism and selling of the gametophytes. Most populations consisted of numerous genotypes, and the average heterozygosities of E. arvense and E. hyemale equalled 0.092 and 0.134, respectively. The commonly observed excess of the heterozygote genotypes indicates that there are interclonal differences in the frequency of vegetative reproduction. The level of genetic divergence among populations was considerable even within a limited geographic area. It is suggested that the life history of Equisetum, characterized by the inefficiency of spore germination and gametophyte reproduction in noncolonizing situations, limits the level of gene flow and leads to a great genetic divergence between populations.

#Equisetum (Equisetaceae) species or hybrids? ISSR fingerprinting profiles help improve diagnoses based on morphology and anatomy
#Brune, T Thiv, M Haas, K
#2008
--------------------------------
The applicability of "inter-simple sequence repeats" (ISSR)-PCR as a molecular character complex for differentiation of Equisetum taxa is described with a special focus on the detection of hybrids. All Central European Equisetum species and the four most frequent hybrids are considered: E. arvense, E. fluviatile, E. telmateia, E. palustre, E. sylvaticum, E. pratense, E. x litorale, E. ramosissimum, E. hyemale, E. variegatum, E. x moorei, E. x trachyodon and E. x meridionale. The ISSR banding patterns are highly typical for each species. The positions of the clusters of hybrid taxa prove their hybrid origin and enable identification of the parental species. Genetic similarities of populations suggest that in some species vegetative reproduction predominates (e.g. E. arvense), whereas for others (e.g. E. telmateia) sexual reproduction seems to be more frequent. In addition to the molecular analyses, the characteristics of stem cross sections of the four hybrids and their parental species are shown and discussed.
