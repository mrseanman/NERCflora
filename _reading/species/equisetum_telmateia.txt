#Equisetum (Equisetaceae) species or hybrids? ISSR fingerprinting profiles help improve diagnoses based on morphology and anatomy
#Brune, T Thiv, M Haas, K
#2008
--------------------------------
The applicability of "inter-simple sequence repeats" (ISSR)-PCR as a molecular character complex for differentiation of Equisetum taxa is described with a special focus on the detection of hybrids. All Central European Equisetum species and the four most frequent hybrids are considered: E. arvense, E. fluviatile, E. telmateia, E. palustre, E. sylvaticum, E. pratense, E. x litorale, E. ramosissimum, E. hyemale, E. variegatum, E. x moorei, E. x trachyodon and E. x meridionale. The ISSR banding patterns are highly typical for each species. The positions of the clusters of hybrid taxa prove their hybrid origin and enable identification of the parental species. Genetic similarities of populations suggest that in some species vegetative reproduction predominates (e.g. E. arvense), whereas for others (e.g. E. telmateia) sexual reproduction seems to be more frequent. In addition to the molecular analyses, the characteristics of stem cross sections of the four hybrids and their parental species are shown and discussed.
