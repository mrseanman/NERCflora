#RAPD analyses of hybridization events in Cardamine (Brassicaceae).
#Neuffer, B, Jahncke, P
#1997
--------------------------------
Recent hybrid speciation events between the diploid Cardamine rivularis and the diploid C. amara leading to the triploid C. xinsueta were investigated with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The hybrid nature of C. xinsueta was confirmed by the additivity of RAPD markers which discriminate the parent species. An unexpectedly high level of genetic variation within C. xinsueta argues for several hybridization events and/or backcrossing with C. rivularis. A low number of nonparental bands in C. xinsueta indicates the younger age of this taxon. In contrast to the situation in C. xinsueta, low variability was observed in the hexaploid C. schulzii, a derivative species of C. xinsueta. C. schulzii probably originated recently by a single autopolyploidization event. The higher number of non- parental bands in C. schulzii is explained by the changing genetic variability of the parental populations. Evidence for potential gene flow across the ploidy levels is also provided.

#Hybridization and evolution in Cardamine (Brassicaceae) at Urnerboden, central Switzerland: Biosystematic and molecular evidence.
#Urbanska, KM, Hurka, H, Landolt, E, Neuffer, B, Mummenhoff, K
#1997
--------------------------------
Hybridization between two diploid (2n = 2x = 16) species of Brassicaceae, Cardamine rivalaris and C. amara, at Urnerboden, Central Switzerland, resulted in the rather unusual triploid hybrid C. insueta (2n = 3x = 24), and later on in the amphiploid C. schulzii (2n = 6x = 48). The hybrid and the neopolyploid species colonized successfully some manmade biotopes. Plants of C. insueta are mostly functional females with non-dehiscent anthers, but true hermaphrodite individuals with partly sterile pollen grains also occur within the population. Analyses of cpDNA and nuclear DNA permitted to establish the parentage of the hybrid: the maternal parent which contributed unreduced egg cells proved to be C. rivularis whereas the normally reduced pollen originated from C. amara. The pronounced genetic variability in C. insueta revealed by isozyme and RAPD analyses; at variance with the polarized segregation, heterogamy and strong vegetative reproduction of the hybrid, is possibly influenced by recurrent formation of C. insueta which party results from backcrosses between C. insueta and C. rivularis but may also proceed by other pathways. The amphiploid Cardamine schulzii has normally developed anthers but its pollen is sometimes highly sterile. The surprisingly uniform genetic make-up of the new amphiploid species might be related to its possible monotopic origin and/or young phylogenetic age but should be further assessed. Site management seems to be very important to a further development of hybridogenous populations and their parent species. In conclusion, the evolution at Urnerboden is discussed in the context of the traditional concept of multiple plant origins.

#Natural hybridization in Cardamine (Brassicaceae) in the Pyrenees: evidence from morphological and molecular data.
#Marhold, K, Lihova, J, Perny, M, Grupe, R, Neuffer, B
#2002
--------------------------------
While researching Cardamine (Brassicaceae) in the Pyrenees, putative hybrid plants were found at two natural sites. Pollen grain viability, AFLP, and multivariate morphometric analyses were performed in order to assess the plants' presumed hybrid origin, establishing that natural hybridization between the diploids C. crassifolia and C. amara ssp. pyrenaea had occurred. A new diploid nothospecies, C. xenriquei (2n = 2x = 16), is described. Examination of 18 morphological characters showed the intermediacy of the hybrid between the parental taxa in most characters. AFLP analyses of C. amara ssp. amara, ssp. austriaca, ssp. olotensis and C. raphanifolia, demonstrated the close position of the hybrid to C. crassifolia, and revealed that the highest number of markers were shared with the parents. Polymorphism found in the AFLP pattern of the hybrid suggested recurrent origin, segregation and/or backcrosses, although, assessment of pollen viability indicated high male sterility. The hybridization event reported here represents the second documented case between the C. pratensis group and C. amara. An account of the nomenclature of C. crassifolia is also presented, including lectotypification of relevant names.

#Cardamine amara L. (Brassicaceae) in dynamic habitats: Genetic composition and diversity of seed bank and established populations.
#Koch, M, Huthmann, M, Bernhardt, KG
#2003
--------------------------------
We investigated the distribution of genetic diversity in the strictly outcrossing plant species Cardamine amara using isozyme analysis. We investigated 36 populations from an area of approximately 900 square kilometres in a geographically well-defined region in Northwestern Germany. For these 36 populations we did not find any geographical structuring of genetic diversity. For ten out of the 36 populations we compared the genetic diversity of established population and soil seed bank from two different depths. At these ten sites we also studied differences in the species composition of soil seed bank and of established vegetation as an indicator of environmental dynamics. The corresponding results indicate that increasing dynamics of the habitat decreased the similarity between aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank and the homogeneity of the vertical distribution of seeds. Moreover, increasing environmental dynamics non-significantly increased heterozygosity. In typical, disturbed wet woodland habitats, Cardamine amara established a long-term persistent seed bank with up to 35,900 seeds m(-2). Here the overall genetic diversity stored in the seed bank was similar to the one of the actually established population. Nevertheless, wet woodland seed bank subpopulations from different depths were more similar to each other genetically than compared to the established populations. Most established and seed bank populations were genetically close to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Our study demonstrates that established C. amara populations do not represent simple representative genetic subsets of the underlying seed banks.

#Morphometric and AFLP re-evaluation of tetraploid Cardamine amara (Brassicaceae) in the Mediterranean.
#Lihova, J, Marhold, K, Tribsch, A, Stuessy, TF
#2004
--------------------------------
Cardamine amara, an Eurasian species comprising several subspecies, was examined through morphometric and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses to re-evaluate subspecific status of tetraploid C. amara subsp. olotensis from Catalonia (NE Spain) and to resolve the taxonomic position of Central Italian populations usually placed within C. amara and/or C. raphanifolia s. l. A presumptive close relative from the Caucasus, diploid C. wiedemanniana, was also analyzed for AFLPs. Morphometric results show Catalonian and Italian populations to be similar to each other, but distinct from other C. amara. With both principal coordinate analysis and the neighbour-joining tree based on AFLP data, three main groups are delimited: (1) tetraploid Catalonian C. amara subsp. olotensis and Italian populations, (2) all other diploid and tetraploid subspecies of C. amara, and (3) diploid C. wiedemanniana. As a result of this study, Italian and Catalonian populations are herein treated as a single species, C. amporitana, distinct from C. amara. Catalonian populations appear genetically depauperate, perhaps having experienced bottlenecks during Pleistocene glaciation, or originating via long-distance dispersal from the Apennine Peninsula.

#Evolutionary history of the polyploid complex of Cardamine amara (Brassicaceae): isozyme evidence.
#Marhold, K, Huthmann, M, Hurka, H
#2002
--------------------------------
In samples from 56 populations of Cardamine amara, representing four diploid subspecies (subspp, amara, opicii, balcanica, and pyrenaea) and two tetraploid subspecies (subspp, austriaca and olotensis) from different parts of the European distribution area, four enzyme systems with 23 alleles were studied. These data, together with previous morphological and karyological data, suggest that the distribution and variation pattern within the species was strongly influenced by the last glacial period and postglacial migrations. Cardamine amara subsp. pyrenaea is monomorphic for a unique allele, and subsp. balcanica has a unique allele, too which, however, is not fixed in all populations of the taxon. Both taxa seem to be relic ones, although otherwise subsp. balcanica in respect of allelic spectrum much resembles subsp. amara. The other two diploid subspecies, subsp. amara and subsp. opicii, are not characterised by presence of unique alleles but differ in allele frequencies. The two tetraploid subspecies have different evolutionary histories. C. amara subsp. austriaca seems to be an autopolyploid derivative of subsp. amara which colonised open space offered by retreating glaciers in the Eastern Alps. C. amara subsp. olotensis from the Iberian Peninsula represents most probably a polyploid of preglacial time.

#Comparative ITS and AFLP analysis of diploid Cardamine (Brassicaceae) taxa from closely related polyploid complexes.
#Marhold, K, Lihova, J, Perny, M, Bleeker, W
#2004
--------------------------------
Background and Aims Diploid representatives from the related polyploid complexes of Cardamine amara, C. pratensis and C. raphanifolia (Brassicaceae), were studied to elucidate phylogenetic relationships among the complexes and among the individual taxa included. Methods Two independent molecular data sets were used: nucleotide sequences from the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nrDNA, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Seventeen diploid taxa from the studied groups were sampled. Key Results Both ITS and AFLP analyses provided congruent results in inferred relationships, and revealed two main lineages. While the C. amara group, consisting of C. wiedemanniana and four subspecies of C. amara, was resolved as a well-supported monophyletic group, taxa from the C. pratensis and C. tenera groups (the latter representing diploid taxa of the complex of C. raphanifolia) all appeared together in a single clade/cluster with no support for the recognition of either of the groups. Intra-individual polymorphisms and patterns of nucleotide variation in the ITS region in C. uliginosa and C. tenera, together with the distribution of AFLP bands, indicate ancient hybridization and introgression among these Caucasian diploids. Conclusions The lack of supported hierarchical structure suggests that extensive reticulate evolution between these groups, even at the diploid level, has occurred (although an alternative explanation, namely ancestral polymorphism in ITS data, cannot be completely excluded). Several implications for the investigation of the polyploid complexes of concern are drawn. When tracing origins of polyploid taxa, a much more complex scenario should be expected, taking into account all relatives as potential parents, irrespective of the group in which they are classified.

#Molecular systematics of Cardamine and allied genera (Brassicaceae): ITS and non-coding chloroplast DNA.
#Franzke, A, Pollmann, K, Bleeker, W, Kohrt, R, Hurka, H
#1998
--------------------------------
Representatives of the genera Cardamine, Dentaria, Nasturtium, Rorippa and Armoracia (Brassicaceae) were analyzed to elucidate their phylogenetic relationships based on nuclear (ITS) and non-coding chloroplast (cp) DNA sequences. Dentaria seems to be polyphyletic. The two studied Dentaria species group with different Cardamine clades, and it is argued that D. bulbifera is an allopolyploid originating from a hybridization between a Cardamine and a Dentaria species. In the ITS tree, Nasturtium and Rorippa form well supported clades but their relationship to Cardamine and Armoracia remains unresolved, in the cpDNA tree, Nasturtium groups together with Cardamine. Hybridization events apparently played a role in the evolution of Nasturtium. The Cardamine/Nasturtium clade is separated from a clade placing Rorippa and Armoracia together. Armoracia is closely related to Rorippa. Analyses of the 19 Cardamine species studied revealed three main groupings, a northern hemispheric and two southern hemispheric groups. Within the northern hemisphere taxa the C. pratensis complex forms a well supported clade which seems to be closely related to C, amara, C. raphanifolia and C, flexuosa. The positions of C. hirsuta and C. impatiens are uncertain. The two southern hemisphere clades consist of New Guinean species and south-eastern Australian/Tasmanian and subantarctic species, respectively. They may reflect migration routes from the northern to the southern hemisphere, but further studies are necessary to fully understand the evolution of the bihemispheric distribution pattern of Cardamine.

--------------------------------
PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Contact zones between diploids and their autopolyploid descendants represent a unique evolutionary venue for studying polyploid establishment, cytotype coexistence, and interactions. Here, we examine cytotype coexistence in a diploid-tetraploid contact zone of a perennial herb, Cardamine amara, located north of the Alps by assessing cytotype spatial patterns, ecological divergence, and genetic variation and structure. METHODS: Flow cytometry was applied to screen DNA ploidy levels in 302 populations (3296 individuals) and the genetic variation of a selection of 25 populations was examined using microsatellite and AFLP markers. Environmental (landscape and climatic) data were analyzed to assess ecological differentiation between the cytotypes. KEY RESULTS: A parapatric distribution of the cytotypes with a relatively wide (over 100 km in some regions) secondary contact zone was identified. Mixed-ploidy populations, documented for the first time in this species, as well as triploid individuals were found along the diploid-tetraploid borderline. Different climatic requirements of the two main cytotypes were revealed, mirrored in their altitudinal separation. The tetraploids were genetically differentiated from both the diploids and the modeled, in silico autotetraploid genotypes, in accordance with the assumed polyploid origin and spread linked to past glaciations, and largely independent evolution in allopatry. CONCLUSIONS: The observed spatial and genetic patterns likely reflect the evolutionary and colonization history of the two cytotypes and have been maintained by multiple factors such as ecological divergence, limited gene flow between the cytotypes, and the restricted dispersal capacity.
