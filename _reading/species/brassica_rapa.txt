#A direct regional scale estimate of transgene movement from genetically modified oilseed rape to its wild progenitors
#Wilkinson, MJ,  Davenport, IJ,  Charters, YM,  Jones, AE,   Allainguillaume, J,   Butler, HT,   Mason, DC and   Raybould, AF
#2000
--------------------------------
One of the major environmental concerns over genetically modified (GM) crops relates to transgene movement into wild relatives. The pattern of  hybridization ultimately affects the scale and rapidity of ecological
   change and the feasibility of containment. A new procedure for
   quantifying hybrid formation over large areas is described. Remote
   sensing was used to identify possible sites of sympatry between
   Brassica napus and ifs progenitor species across 15 000 km(2) of
   south-east England in 1998. Two sympatric populations with B. rapa and
   one with B. oleracea were found over the entire survey area. Every
   newly recruited plant in these populations in 1999 was screened for
   hybrid status using now cytometry and molecular analyses. One hybrid
   was observed from the 505 plants screened in the B. rapa populations
   but none of the nine B. oleracea recruits were hybrids. Measures to
   minimize gene now are suggested, and a procedure for the post-release
   evaluation and containment of GM cultivars is proposed.

#Low probability of chloroplast movement from oilseed rape (Brassica napus) into wild Brassica rapa
#Scott, SE and Wilkinson, MJ
#1999
--------------------------------
Pollen-mediated movement of transgenes from transplastomic oilseed rape (Brassica napus) into wild relatives will be avoided if chloroplasts  are maternally transmitted. We assess the probability of chloroplast
   exchange between conventional oilseed rape and wild Brassica rapa to
   model the future behavior of transplastomic cultivars. Primers specific
   to cpDNA were used to demonstrate maternal inheritance of chloroplasts
   in 47 natural hybrids between cultivated B. napus and wild B. rapa. We
   conclude that there will be no or negligible pollen-mediated
   chloroplast dispersal from oilseed rape. Transgene introgression could
   still occur in mixed populations, however, if B. napus acted as the
   recurrent female parent. Rate of transfer would then depend on the
   abundance of mixed populations, their persistence as mixtures, and
   hybridization frequency within stands. A low incidence of sympatry
   (0.6-0.7%) between wild B. rapa and cultivated B. napus along the river
   Thames, UK, in 1997 and 1998, suggests mixed stands will form only
   rarely. Eighteen feral populations of B. napus also showed a strong
   tendency toward rapid decline in plant number, seed return, and
   ultimately, extinction within 3 years, Conversely, hybrid production is
   significant in mixed stands, and the absence of control practices means
   that oilseed rape will have slightly greater persistence. We infer that
   some introgression from transplastomic B. napus into B. rapa is
   inevitable in mixed populations even though such populations will occur
   infrequently and will tend to lose B. napus plants relatively quickly.
   Chloroplast exchange will be extremely rare and scattered.
