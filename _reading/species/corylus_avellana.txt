#Chloroplast DNA variation, postglacial recolonization and hybridization in hazel, Coryllus avellana.
#Palmé, AE and Vendramin, GG
#2002
--------------------------------
To unravel the postglacial migration history of hazel, Corylus avellana , the genetic variation at two types of chloroplast DNA markers, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and microsatellites, was assessed in 26 natural hazel populations distributed across the range of C. avellana . In addition a sequence of 2468 base pairs, which contains the matK gene, was analysed in seven individuals. Very little variation was detected overall [h T:PCR-RFLP = 0.091, h T:microsatellite = 0.423, π (nucleotide diversity) = 0.00093] but the microsatellite markers, which have the highest levels of variation, show a clear geographical structure that divides Europe into two areas: (i) Italy and the Balkans, on one hand and (ii) the rest of Europe, on the other hand. These data exclude Italy and the Balkans as possible origins of the postglacial recolonization but cannot unambiguously show which other area is the origin, since the genetic data does not indicate the direction of spread. If we take the pollen record into account, the most likely scenario would be an expansion from southwestern France into most of Europe except Italy and the Balkans, and then a local expansion in the latter area. The two main haplotypes identified with both PCR-RFLP and sequencing, A and B, were found not only in C. avellana but also in other European Corylus species and cultivars. Haplotype A, which is dominating all investigated natural populations of C. avellana , is also found in the European tree hazel ( C. colurna ) and haplotype B, which is rare in C. avellana , has been identified in the filbert ( C. maxima ) and C. avellana cultivars. This pattern seems to indicate a history of past hybridization among the European Corylus species and cultivars.

#Does the genome of Corylus avellana L contain sequences homologous to the self-incompatibility gene of Brassica?.
#Hampson, CR, Coleman, GD, Azarenko, AN
#1996
--------------------------------
Self-incompatibility is a genetic mechanism enforcing cross- pollination in plants. Hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) expresses the sporophytic type of self-incompatibility, for which the molecular genetic basis is characterized only in Brassica. The hypothesis that the hazelnut genome contains homologs of Brassica self-incompatibility genes was tested. The S-locus glycoprotein gene (SLG) and the kinase-encoding domain of the S-receptor kinase (SRK) gene of B. oleracea L. were used to probe blots of genomic DNA from six genotypes of hazelnut. Weak hybridization with the SLG probe was detected for all hazelnut genotypes tested; however, no-hybridization was detected with PCR-generated probes corresponding to two conserved regions of the SLG gene. One of these PCR probes included the region of SLG encoding the 11 invariant cysteine residues that are an important structural feature of all S-family genes. The present evidence suggests that hazelnut DNA hybridizing to SLG differs significantly from the Brassica gene, and that the S-genes cloned from Brassica will not be useful for exploring self- incompatibility in hazelnut.

#Identification of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers for self-incompatibility alleles in Corylus avellana L..
#Pomper, KW, Azarenko, AN, Bassil, N, Davis, JW, Mehlenbacher, SA
#1998
--------------------------------
Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were identified for self-incompatibility (SI) alleles that will allow marker- assisted selection of desired S-alleles in hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.). DNA was extracted from young leaves collected from field-planted parents and 26 progeny of the cross OSU 23.017 (S1S12) x VR6-28 (S2S26) (OSU23 x VR6). Screening of 10- base oligonucleotide RAPD primers was performed using bulked segregant analysis. DNA samples from 6 trees each were pooled into four 'bulks', one for each of the following: S-1 S-2, S-1 S-26. S-2 S-12, and S-12 S-26 'Super bulks' of 12 trees each for S-1, S-2, S-12, and S-26 were then created for each allele by combining the appropriate bulks. The DNA from these four super bulks and from the parents was used as a template in the PCR assays. A total of 250 primers were screened, and one RAPD marker each was identified for alleles S-2 (OPI07(750)) and S-1 (OPJ14(1700)) OPJ14(1700) was identified in 13 of 14 S-1 individuals of the cross OSU23 x VR6 used in bulking and yielded a false positive in 1 non-S-1 individual. This same marker was not effective outside the original cross, identifying 4 of 5 S-1 progeny in another cross, 'Willamette' x VR6-28 ('Will' x VR6), but yielded false positives in 4 of 9 non-S-1 individuals from the cross 'Casina' x VR6-28 ('Cas' x VR6). OPI07(750) served as an excellent marker for the S-2 allele and was linked closely to this allele, identifying 12 of 13 S-2 individuals in the OSU23 x VR6 population with no false positives. OPI07(750) was found in 4 of 4 S-2 individuals from 'Will' x VR and 7 of 7 S-2 individuals of 'Cas' x VR6 with no false positives, as well as 10 of 10 S-2 individuals of the cross OSU 296.082 (S1S8) x VR8-32 (S2S26), with only 1 false positive individual out of 21 progeny. OPI07(750) was also present in 5 of 5 cultivars carrying the S-2 allele, with no false-positive bands in non-S-2 cultivars, and correctly identified all but 2 S-2 individuals in 57 additional selections in the breeding program. In the OSU23 x VR6 population, the recombination rate between the marker OPJ14(1700) and the S-1 allele was 7.6% and between the OPI07(750) marker and the S-2 allele was 3.8%. RAPD marker bands were excised from gels, cloned, and sequenced to enable the production of longer primers (18 or 24 bp) that were used to obtain sequence characterized amplified regions (SCARs). Both the S-1 and S-2 markers were successfully cloned and 18 bp primers yielded the sole OPJ14(1700) product, while 24-bp primers yielded OPI07(750) as well as an additional smaller product (700 bp) that was not polymorphic but was present in all of the S-genotypes examined.

#Microsatellite markers in hazelnut: isolation, characterization, and cross-species amplification
#Bassil, NV, Botta, R and Mehlenbacher, SA
#2005
--------------------------------
Three microsatellite-enriched libraries of the european hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) were constructed: library A for CA repeats, library B for GA repeats, and library C for GAA repeats. Twenty-five primer pairs amplified easy-to-score single loci and were used to investigate pollymorphism among 20 C. avellana genotypes and to evaluate cross-species amplification in seven Corylus L. species. Microsatellite alleles were estimated by fluorescent capillary electrophoresis fragment sizing. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 12 (average = 7.16) in C. avellana and from 5 to 22 overall (average = 13.32). With the exception of CAC-B110, di-nucleotide SSRs were characterized by a relatively large number of alleles per locus (>= 5), high average observed and expected heterozygosity (H-o and H-e > 0.6), and a high mean polymorphic information content (PIC >= 0.6) in C. avellana. In contrast, tri-nucleotide microsatellites were more homozygous (H-o = 0.4 on average) and less informative than di-nucleotide simple sequence repeats (SSRs) as indicated by a lower mean number of alleles per locus (4.5), H-e (0.59), and PIC (0.54). Cross-species amplification in Corylus was demonstrated. These microsatellite markers were highly heterozygous and polymorphic and differentiated among genotypes of C. avellana irrespective of geographical origin. They will aid in fingerprinting genotypes of the european hazelnut and other Corylus species, genome mapping, and genetic diversity assessments.

#Characterization and evaluation of microsatellite loci in European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) and their transferability to other Corylus species
#Boccacci, P, Akkak, A, Bassil, NV, Mehlenbacher, SA and Botta, R
#2005
--------------------------------
In this work, 18 microsatellite loci were developed in the European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) using three enriched genomic libraries. They were evaluated on a set of 20 accessions of this species on the basis of number of alleles (mean: 7.1), expected heterozygosity (mean: 0.67), power of discrimination (mean: 0.77) and polymorphism information content (mean: 0.64). Cross-species transferability was evaluated using seven other Corylus species. All primer pairs amplified in all species, except for CaT-C505 in Corylus ferox and CaT-A114 in Corylus californica.

#In silico mining, characterization and cross-species transferability of EST-SSR markers for European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.)
#Boccacci, P., Beltramo, C., Prando, M. A. Sandoval, Lembo, A., Sartor, C., Mehlenbacher, S. A., Botta, R., Marinoni, D. Torello
#2015
--------------------------------
The European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) is one of the most important nut crops. In this work, we characterize functional microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for genetic analysis and molecular breeding in this species. A total of 38,454 Betulaceae EST sequences from NCBI resulted in 1,282 non-redundant EST-SSRs. Dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant (63.9 %), followed by trinucleotides (33.8 %). The putative functions of the non-redundant EST-SSRs were classified according to gene ontology (GO) categories (biological process, molecular function, and cellular component). A total of 921 sequences showed significant hits with the non-redundant protein database, and GO categories were assigned to 696 (75.5 %) of them. Flanking primer pairs were designed for 78 di- and trinucleotide EST-SSRs from Alnus glutinosa L. (29), Betula pendula Roth (26), and Betula platyphylla Suckaczev (23). Further, 41 dinucleotide repeats selected from hazelnut transcriptome sequences were added. Thirty-six out 119 primer pairs generated amplification products in six hazelnut accessions and in the samples of the species from which they were isolated. Among them, 20 were polymorphic when tested on 18 hazelnut cultivars. Fifteen loci are suitable for mapping in a F-1 population of 'Tonda Gentile delle Langhe' x 'Merveille de Bollwiller' and 11 of them were functionally annotated. The cross-species transferability of 36 EST-SSR loci within nine Corylus species was also performed. The success rate of markers transferability (excluding C. avellana) ranged from 11 to 100 %, with an average of 55 %. The EST-SSRs developed increase the number of markers currently available for hazelnut.

#In silico development and characterization of tri-nucleotide simple sequence repeat markers in hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.)
#Bhattarai, G, Mehlenbacher, SA
#2017
--------------------------------
Plant genomes are now sequenced rapidly and inexpensively. In silico approaches allow efficient development of simple sequence repeat markers, also known as microsatellite markers, from these sequences. A search of the genome sequence of 'Jefferson' hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) identified 8,708 tri-nucleotide simple sequence repeats with at least five repeat units, and stepwise removal of the less promising sequences led to the development of 150 polymorphic markers. Fragments in the 'Jefferson' sequence containing trinucleotide repeats were used as references and aligned with genomic sequences from seven other cultivars. Following in silico alignment, sequences that showed variation in number of repeat units were selected and primer pairs were designed for 243 of them. Screening on agarose gels identified 173 as polymorphic. Removal of duplicate and previously published sequences reduced the number to 150, for which fluorescent primers and capillary electrophoresis were used for amplicon sizing. These were characterized using 50 diverse hazelnut accessions. Of the 150, 132 generated the expected one or two alleles per accession while 18 amplified more than two amplicons in at least one accession. Diversity parameters of the 132 marker loci averaged 4.73 for number of alleles, 0.51 for expected heterozygosity (H-e), 0.49 for observed heterozygosity (H-o), 0.46 for polymorphism information content (PIC), and 0.04 for frequency of null alleles. The clustering of the 50 accessions in a dendrogram constructed from the 150 markers confirmed the wide genetic diversity and presence of three of the four major geographic groups: Central European, Black Sea, and Spanish-Italian. In the mapping population, 105 loci segregated, of which 101 were assigned to a linkage group (LG), with positions well-dispersed across all 11 LGs. These new markers will be useful for cultivar fingerprinting, diversity studies, genome comparisons, mapping, and alignment of the linkage map with the genome sequence and physical map.

#Allozyme diversity and genetic structure of marginal and central populations of Corylus avellana L. (Betulaceae) in Europe.
#Persson, H, Widén, B, Andersson, S and Svensson, L
#2004
--------------------------------
Corylus avellana L. (hazel, Betulaceae) is a long-lived, widespread shrub in Europe, having its northern range margin in Fennoscandia and a postglacial history involving range- expansion from refugial areas in southern Europe. In this study, we tested for a relationship between marginality and low within-population genetic diversity by assessing patterns of variation at 14 putatively neutral allozyme loci (comprising 43 putative alleles) within and between 40 natural populations of C. avellana along a north-south transect in Europe. Geographically marginal populations (central Sweden) showed lower levels of within-population diversity than populations in more central regions, as indicated by significant negative correlations between latitude and the percentage of polymorphic loci (r(S)=-0.47, P < 0.001), the average number of alleles per locus (r(S)=-0.65, P < 0.001), the expected heterozygosity (r(S)=-0.19, P < 0.05), and the proportion of distinguishable genotypes (r(S)=-0.56, P < 0.001). These patterns, combined with the unusually high between-population component of gene diversity (G(ST)=19.7%) and allelic richness (A(ST)=24%) in the marginal region, can be attributed to historical bottlenecks during the species' postglacial range-expansion, but may also reflect a history of genetic drift in the small, isolated populations occupying the marginal region. Information on the spatial distribution of genotypes provide further support for a role of vegetative reproduction (layering) in the structuring of genetic variation within populations.

#Isolation and partial characterisation of acid phosphatase isozymes from dormant oilseed of Corylus avellana L..
#Andriotis, VME, Ross, JD
#2004
--------------------------------
The acid phosphatase (orthophosphoric-monoester phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.2) complement from dormant hazel (Corylus avellana L.) seeds was found to exhibit significant electrophoretic heterogeneity partially attributable to the presence of distinct molecular forms. In axiferous tissue, total acid phosphatase activity increased in a biphasic fashion during chilling, a treatment necessary to alleviate seed dormancy. Three acid phosphatase isozymes were isolated from cotyledons of dormant hazel seeds by successive ammonium sulphate precipitation, size-exclusion, Concanavalin A affinity, cation- and anion-exchange chromatographies resulting in 75-, 389- and 191-fold purification (APase1, APase2, APase3, respectively). The three glycosylated isoforms were isolated to catalytic homogeneity as determined by electrophoretic, kinetic and heat-inactivation studies. The native acid phosphatase complement of hazel seeds had an apparent M-r of 81.53.5 kDa as estimated by size-exclusion chromatography, while the determined pI values were 5.1 (APase1), 6.9 (APase2) and 7.3 (APase3). The optimum pH for p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis was pH 3 (APase1), pH 5.6 (APase2) and pH 6 (APase3). The hazel isozymes hydrolysed a variety of phosphorylated substrates in a non-specific manner, exhibiting low K-m and the highest specificity constant (V-max/K-m) for pyrophosphate. They were not primary phytases since they could not initiate phytic acid hydrolysis, while APase2 and APase3 had significant phospho- tyrosine phosphatase activity. Inorganic phosphate was a competitive inhibitor, while activity was significantly impaired in the presence of vanadate and fluoride.

#Does the genome of Corylus avellana L contain sequences homologous to the self-incompatibility gene of Brassica?.
#Hampson, CR, Coleman, GD, Azarenko, AN
#1996
--------------------------------
Self-incompatibility is a genetic mechanism enforcing cross- pollination in plants. Hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) expresses the sporophytic type of self-incompatibility, for which the molecular genetic basis is characterized only in Brassica. The hypothesis that the hazelnut genome contains homologs of Brassica self-incompatibility genes was tested. The S-locus glycoprotein gene (SLG) and the kinase-encoding domain of the S-receptor kinase (SRK) gene of B. oleracea L. were used to probe blots of genomic DNA from six genotypes of hazelnut. Weak hybridization with the SLG probe was detected for all hazelnut genotypes tested; however, no-hybridization was detected with PCR-generated probes corresponding to two conserved regions of the SLG gene. One of these PCR probes included the region of SLG encoding the 11 invariant cysteine residues that are an important structural feature of all S-family genes. The present evidence suggests that hazelnut DNA hybridizing to SLG differs significantly from the Brassica gene, and that the S-genes cloned from Brassica will not be useful for exploring self- incompatibility in hazelnut.

#RAPD markers linked to eastern filbert blight resistance in Corylus avellana.
#Mehlenbacher, SA, Brown, RN, Davis, JW, Chen, H, Bassil, NV, Smith, DC, Kubisiak, TL
#2004
--------------------------------
A total of 1,110 decamer primers were screened for RAPD markers linked to a dominant allele in hazelnut (Corylus avellana) that confers resistance to eastern filbert blight caused by Anisogramma anomala. Twenty RAPD markers linked in coupling, and five markers linked in repulsion, were found. A seedling population was used to construct a linkage map of the region flanking the resistance locus. The map spans 46.6 cM, with 14 markers on one side of the resistance locus and eight on the other side. Eleven markers showed less than 3% recombination with resistance, including three that showed no recombination. Seven of these 11 markers are sufficiently robust to allow their use in marker-assisted selection. These include AA12(850) which shows no recombination, and six markers on one side of the resistance locus: 173(500), 152(800), 122(825), 275(1130), H19(650) and O16(1250). Marker 268(580), which flanks the resistance locus on the other side, is also suitable for use in marker-assisted selection, but shows 5.8% recombination with resistance. Other markers are less suitable for marker-assisted selection because of sensitivity to changes in primer or MgCl2 concentration, or the long time required for electrophoresis to separate bands of similar size. The 16 markers closest to the resistance locus were cloned and sequenced. The W07(365) marker, which showed no recombination with the resistance locus but is difficult to score, includes a CT microsatellite repeat. The sequence information will allow the design of SCAR primers and eventual map-based cloning of the resistance allele.

--------------------------------
Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were identified for self-incompatibility (SI) alleles that will allow marker- assisted selection of desired S-alleles in hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.). DNA was extracted from young leaves collected from field-planted parents and 26 progeny of the cross OSU 23.017 (S1S12) x VR6-28 (S2S26) (OSU23 x VR6). Screening of 10- base oligonucleotide RAPD primers was performed using bulked segregant analysis. DNA samples from 6 trees each were pooled into four 'bulks', one for each of the following: S-1 S-2, S-1 S-26. S-2 S-12, and S-12 S-26 'Super bulks' of 12 trees each for S-1, S-2, S-12, and S-26 were then created for each allele by combining the appropriate bulks. The DNA from these four super bulks and from the parents was used as a template in the PCR assays. A total of 250 primers were screened, and one RAPD marker each was identified for alleles S-2 (OPI07(750)) and S-1 (OPJ14(1700)) OPJ14(1700) was identified in 13 of 14 S-1 individuals of the cross OSU23 x VR6 used in bulking and yielded a false positive in 1 non-S-1 individual. This same marker was not effective outside the original cross, identifying 4 of 5 S-1 progeny in another cross, 'Willamette' x VR6-28 ('Will' x VR6), but yielded false positives in 4 of 9 non-S-1 individuals from the cross 'Casina' x VR6-28 ('Cas' x VR6). OPI07(750) served as an excellent marker for the S-2 allele and was linked closely to this allele, identifying 12 of 13 S-2 individuals in the OSU23 x VR6 population with no false positives. OPI07(750) was found in 4 of 4 S-2 individuals from 'Will' x VR and 7 of 7 S-2 individuals of 'Cas' x VR6 with no false positives, as well as 10 of 10 S-2 individuals of the cross OSU 296.082 (S1S8) x VR8-32 (S2S26), with only 1 false positive individual out of 21 progeny. OPI07(750) was also present in 5 of 5 cultivars carrying the S-2 allele, with no false-positive bands in non-S-2 cultivars, and correctly identified all but 2 S-2 individuals in 57 additional selections in the breeding program. In the OSU23 x VR6 population, the recombination rate between the marker OPJ14(1700) and the S-1 allele was 7.6% and between the OPI07(750) marker and the S-2 allele was 3.8%. RAPD marker bands were excised from gels, cloned, and sequenced to enable the production of longer primers (18 or 24 bp) that were used to obtain sequence characterized amplified regions (SCARs). Both the S-1 and S-2 markers were successfully cloned and 18 bp primers yielded the sole OPJ14(1700) product, while 24-bp primers yielded OPI07(750) as well as an additional smaller product (700 bp) that was not polymorphic but was present in all of the S-genotypes examined.

#2005
--------------------------------
In this work, 18 microsatellite loci were developed in the European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) using three enriched genomic libraries. They were evaluated on a set of 20 accessions of this species on the basis of number of alleles (mean: 7.1), expected heterozygosity (mean: 0.67), power of discrimination (mean: 0.77) and polymorphism information content (mean: 0.64). Cross-species transferability was evaluated using seven other Corylus species. All primer pairs amplified in all species, except for CaT-C505 in Corylus ferox and CaT-A114 in Corylus californica.

#Transferability of Microsatellite Markers in the Betulaceae
#Gurcan K, Mehlenbacher SA.
#2010
--------------------------------
Microsatellite-containing sequences for the Betulaceae (Betula, Corylus, and Alnus) were retrieved front GenBank and used to develop twelve new microsatellite marker printer pairs that amplified and were polymorphic in european hazelnut (Corylus avellana). The printer pairs were characterized using 50 european hazelnut accessions. Nine of these microsatellites that segregated in a mapping population were assigned to linkage groups. The 12 new printer pairs will be useful in genetic studies in Corylus and Betula. To investigate transferability of microsatellite primer pairs in the family Betulaceae, we assessed the ability of 129 simple sequence repeat (SSR) printer pairs (75 from Corylus, 52 from Betula, and two from Alnus) to amplify DNA of 69 accessions representing diverse taxa Microsaellite primer pairs from Betula amplified 92% of Betula, 51% of Alnus, 41% of Corylus, 37% of Carpinus, 35% of Ostryopsis, and 34% of Ostrya accessions. In the 69 accessions, microsatellite primer pairs from Corylus amplified 81% of Corylus, 55% of Carpinus, 53% of Ostrya, 51% of Ostryopsis, 41% of Alnus, and 39% of Betula accessions. An additional 147 SSR primer pairs developed from Corylus, used to amplify a subset of 32 accessions, gave similar values: 92% in Corylus, 33% in Carpinus, 33% in Ostrya, 44% in Ostryopsis, 35% in Alnus, and 54% in Betula. The high transferability (>39%) of microsatellite primer pairs between Betula and Corylus will allow comparative studies of the two genera with the greatest economic importance.

#Development, characterization, segregation, and mapping of microsatellite markers for European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) from enriched genomic libraries and usefulness in genetic diversity studies
#Guercan K, Mehlenbacher SA, Botta R, Boccacci P
#2010
--------------------------------
Eighty-six new microsatellite loci were developed for European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) by screening two genomic libraries enriched for dinucleotide repeats. The loci, 73 developed from a GA-enriched library and 13 from a CA-enriched library, showed a high level of polymorphism in 50 accessions. The number of alleles per locus ranged from five to 21, with a mean of 10.55. Mean values for expected heterozygosity, observed heterozygosity, and polymorphism information content were high, averaging 0.76, 0.69, and 0.73, respectively. In a mapping population, loci segregated 1:1, 1:2:1, and 1:1:1:1. Segregation distortion and null alleles were observed at some loci. Eighty-one of the 86 loci were assigned to linkage groups. A neighbor-joining dendrogram reflected great diversity among the 50 accessions and showed clustering by geographic origin.

#Genetic relationship among wild, landraces and cultivars of hazelnut (Corylus avellana) from Portugal revealed through ISSR and AFLP markers
#Martins, Sandra, Simoes, Fernanda, Matos, Jose, Silva, Ana Paula, Carnide, Valdemar
#2014
--------------------------------
The genus Corylus, a member of the birch family Betulaceae, includes several species that are widely distributed throughout temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This study assesses the genetic diversity in 26 international cultivars and 32 accessions of Corylus avellana L. from Portugal: 13 wild genotypes and 19 landraces. The genetic relationships among the 58 hazelnuts (Corylus avellana L.) were analyzed using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Eighteen ISSR primers and seven AFLP primer pairs generated a total of 570 unambiguous and repeatable bands, respectively, from which 541 (95.03 %) were polymorphic for both markers. Genetic similarity index values ranged from 0.239 for wild types and cultivars to 0.143 for landraces and wild types. The genetic relationships were presented as a Neighbor-Joining method dendrogram and a two-dimensional principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot. The Neighbor-Joining dendrogram showed three main clusters, and the PCoA analysis has shown to be congruent with the hierarchical analysis. Bayesian analysis clustered all individuals into three groups showing a good separation among wild genotypes, landraces and cultivars. The genetic diversity found on wild genotypes and Portuguese landraces may provide relevant information for the diversity conservation and it will be useful in breeding programs and to identify local selections for preservation.

#In silico mining, characterization and cross-species transferability of EST-SSR markers for European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.)
#Boccacci, P., Beltramo, C., Prando, M. A. Sandoval, Lembo, A., Sartor, C., Mehlenbacher, S. A., Botta, R., Marinoni, D. Torello
#2015
--------------------------------
The European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) is one of the most important nut crops. In this work, we characterize functional microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for genetic analysis and molecular breeding in this species. A total of 38,454 Betulaceae EST sequences from NCBI resulted in 1,282 non-redundant EST-SSRs. Dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant (63.9 %), followed by trinucleotides (33.8 %). The putative functions of the non-redundant EST-SSRs were classified according to gene ontology (GO) categories (biological process, molecular function, and cellular component). A total of 921 sequences showed significant hits with the non-redundant protein database, and GO categories were assigned to 696 (75.5 %) of them. Flanking primer pairs were designed for 78 di- and trinucleotide EST-SSRs from Alnus glutinosa L. (29), Betula pendula Roth (26), and Betula platyphylla Suckaczev (23). Further, 41 dinucleotide repeats selected from hazelnut transcriptome sequences were added. Thirty-six out 119 primer pairs generated amplification products in six hazelnut accessions and in the samples of the species from which they were isolated. Among them, 20 were polymorphic when tested on 18 hazelnut cultivars. Fifteen loci are suitable for mapping in a F-1 population of 'Tonda Gentile delle Langhe' x 'Merveille de Bollwiller' and 11 of them were functionally annotated. The cross-species transferability of 36 EST-SSR loci within nine Corylus species was also performed. The success rate of markers transferability (excluding C. avellana) ranged from 11 to 100 %, with an average of 55 %. The EST-SSRs developed increase the number of markers currently available for hazelnut.

#Development and mapping of microsatellite markers from transcriptome sequences of European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) and use for germplasm characterization
#Colburn, BC, Mehlenbacher, SA, Sathuvalli, VR
#2017
--------------------------------
Microsatellite markers, also known as simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, are useful in genetics and plant breeding for marker-assisted selection, cultivar fingerprinting, and kinship studies. They were previously developed for European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) from enriched libraries, inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) fragments, and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences. This study utilized the 'Jefferson' transcriptome sequence to develop microsatellite markers for hazelnut. Microsatellites were mined from the transcriptome sequence and aligned with the corresponding genomic sequence using a BLASTN search, and primers were designed from the genomic sequence. From a total of 1432 identified microsatellites, 382 primer pairs were designed for repeats with motifs of three base pairs or longer and at least five repeats, and a few di-repeat sequences. The primers were initially screened for polymorphism with a set of 24 C. avellana accessions, and those that were polymorphic were characterized using a set of 63 accessions. One hundred nine polymorphic microsatellite markers that generated one or two fragments per accession were characterized, with AAG, AGC, and ACT being the most common motifs. Two additional SSR primer pairs generated three PCR products in a few accessions. Of the 109 loci, 53 were placed on the linkage map of the mapping population OSU 252.146 x OSU 414.062, and 22 were assigned to linkage groups using alternate segregating populations. A dendrogram constructed from the SSR fingerprints at the 109 new marker loci mostly showed clustering of accessions from similar geographic origins and confirmed the tremendous amount of genetic diversity present within C. avellana. Thesemarkerswill be useful for fingerprinting, marker-assisted selection, and genetic studies in hazelnut.

#In silico development and characterization of tri-nucleotide simple sequence repeat markers in hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.)
#Bhattarai, G, Mehlenbacher, SA
#2017
--------------------------------
Plant genomes are now sequenced rapidly and inexpensively. In silico approaches allow efficient development of simple sequence repeat markers, also known as microsatellite markers, from these sequences. A search of the genome sequence of 'Jefferson' hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) identified 8,708 tri-nucleotide simple sequence repeats with at least five repeat units, and stepwise removal of the less promising sequences led to the development of 150 polymorphic markers. Fragments in the 'Jefferson' sequence containing trinucleotide repeats were used as references and aligned with genomic sequences from seven other cultivars. Following in silico alignment, sequences that showed variation in number of repeat units were selected and primer pairs were designed for 243 of them. Screening on agarose gels identified 173 as polymorphic. Removal of duplicate and previously published sequences reduced the number to 150, for which fluorescent primers and capillary electrophoresis were used for amplicon sizing. These were characterized using 50 diverse hazelnut accessions. Of the 150, 132 generated the expected one or two alleles per accession while 18 amplified more than two amplicons in at least one accession. Diversity parameters of the 132 marker loci averaged 4.73 for number of alleles, 0.51 for expected heterozygosity (H-e), 0.49 for observed heterozygosity (H-o), 0.46 for polymorphism information content (PIC), and 0.04 for frequency of null alleles. The clustering of the 50 accessions in a dendrogram constructed from the 150 markers confirmed the wide genetic diversity and presence of three of the four major geographic groups: Central European, Black Sea, and Spanish-Italian. In the mapping population, 105 loci segregated, of which 101 were assigned to a linkage group (LG), with positions well-dispersed across all 11 LGs. These new markers will be useful for cultivar fingerprinting, diversity studies, genome comparisons, mapping, and alignment of the linkage map with the genome sequence and physical map.

#Discovery, Characterization, and Linkage Mapping of Simple Sequence Repeat Markers In Hazelnut
#Bhattarai, G, Mehlenbacher, SA
#2018
--------------------------------
From the genome sequence of hazelnut (Corylus avellana), 192 new polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed, characterized, and used to investigate genetic diversity in 50 accessions. Next-generation sequencing allows inexpensive sequencing of plant genomes and transcriptomes, and efficient development of polymorphic SSR markers, also known as microsatellite markers, at low cost. A search of the genome sequence of 'Jefferson' hazelnut identified 9094 fragments with long repeat motifs of 4, 5, or 6 base pairs (bp), from which polymorphic SSR markers were developed. The repeat regions in the 'Jefferson' genome were used as references to which genomic sequence reads of seven additional cultivars were aligned in silico. Visual inspection for variation in repeat number among the aligned reads identified 246 as polymorphic, for which primer pairs were designed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by agarose gel separation indicated polymorphism at 195 loci, for which fluorescent forward primers were used to amplify the DNA of 50 hazelnut accessions. Amplicons were post-PCR multiplexed for capillary electrophoresis, and allele sizes were determined for 50 accessions. After eliminating three, 192 were confirmed as polymorphic, and 169 showed only one or two alleles in each of the 50 cultivars, as expected in a diploid. At these 169 SSRs, a total of 843 alleles were found, for an average of 4.99 and a range of 2 to 17 alleles per locus. The mean observed heterozygosity, expected heterozygosity, polymorphism information content, and the frequency of null alleles were 0.51, 0.53, 0.47, and 0.03, respectively. An additional 25 primer pairs produced more than two bands in some accessions with an average of 6.8 alleles. The UPGMA dendrogram revealed a wide genetic diversity and clustered the 50 accessions according to their geographic origin. Of the new SSRs, 132 loci were placed on the linkage map. These new markers will be useful for diversity and parentage studies, cultivar fingerprinting, marker-assisted selection, and aligning the linkage map with scaffolds of the genome sequence.

#Genetic relationship between cultivated and wild hazelnuts (Corylus avellana L.) collected in northern Spain
#Campa A, Trabanco N, Perez-Vega E, Rovira M, Ferreira JJ
#2011
--------------------------------
The genetic relationships between 40 wild hazelnuts collected in northern Spain and cultivated hazelnuts, including 62 local selections and 14 reference cultivars, were investigated using 13 microsatellite loci. Microsatellite analysis revealed considerable diversity; 91 different alleles were identified with a mean of 7 per locus, and polymorphic information content values ranged from 0.43 to 0.83 with a mean of 0.69. The plot obtained from principal coordinate analysis, the unrooted neighbour-joining tree constructed, and the population structure analysis revealed a high level of differentiation between the locally cultivated forms and the remaining materials. Introgressions within these groups were detected in the three analyses. The results indicate that hazelnuts in northern Spain contain (i) a group of accessions clearly differentiated within the Spanish-Italian gene pool, (ii) a group with intermediate forms probably derived from hybridization and (iii) accessions probably derived through exchange with other geographical areas, especially north-eastern Spain. The presence of these different groups within the local cultivated hazelnut germplasm has consequences for its preservation and use.
