#Patterns of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium in a highly structured Hordeum vulgare association-mapping population for the Mediterranean basin
#Comadran, J Thomas, WTB van Eeuwijk, FA Ceccarelli, S Grando, S Stanca, AM Pecchioni, N Akar, T Al-Yassin, A Benbelkacem, A Ouabbou, H Bort, J Romagosa, I Hackett, CA Russell, JR

--------------------------------
Population structure and genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) were
 investigated in 192 Hordeum vulgare accessions providing a
 comprehensive coverage of past and present barley breeding in the
 Mediterranean basin, using 50 nuclear microsatellite and 1,130 DArTA
 (R) markers. Both clustering and principal coordinate analyses clearly
 sub-divided the sample into five distinct groups centred on key
 ancestors and regions of origin of the germplasm. For given genetic
 distances, large variation in LD values was observed, ranging from
 closely linked markers completely at equilibrium to marker pairs at 50
 cM separation still showing significant LD. Mean LD values across the
 whole population sample decayed below r (2) of 0.15 after 3.2 cM. By
 assaying 1,130 genome-wide DArTA (R) markers, we demonstrated that,
 after accounting for population substructure, current genome coverage
 of 1 marker per 1.5 cM except for chromosome 4H with 1 marker per 3.62
 cM is sufficient for whole genome association scans. We show, by
 identifying associations with powdery mildew that map in genomic
 regions known to have resistance loci, that associations can be
 detected in strongly stratified samples provided population structure
 is effectively controlled in the analysis. The population we describe
 is, therefore, shown to be a valuable resource, which can be used in
 basic and applied research in barley.

#Genetics of phenotypic plasticity: QTL analysis in barley, Hordeum vulgare
#Lacaze, X Hayes, PM Korol, A
#2009
--------------------------------
Phenotypic plasticity is the variation in phenotypic traits produced by
 a genotype in different environments. In contrast, environmental
 canalization is defined as the insensitivity of a genotype's phenotype
 to variation in environments. Despite the extensive literature on the
 evolutionary significance and potential genetic mechanisms driving
 plasticity and canalization, few studies tried to unravel the genetic
 basis of this phenomenon. Using both simulations and real data from
 barley (Hordeum vulgare), we used QTL mapping to obtain insights into
 the genetics of phenotypic plasticity. We explored two ways of
 quantifying phenotypic plasticity, namely the phenotypic variance
 across environments and the Finlay-Wilkinson's regression slope. Each
 relates to a different concept of stability. Through QTL detection with
 real and simulated data, we show that each measure of plasticity
 detects specific types of plasticity QTL. Most of the plasticity QTLs
 were detected in the data set with the lowest number of environments.
 All plasticity QTL co-located with loci showing QTL x E interaction and
 there were no QTL that only affected plasticity. The number of
 environments that are considered and their homogeneity is a key to
 interpret the genetic control of phenotypic plasticity. Regulatory
 pathways of plasticity may vary from one set of environments to another
 due to unique features of each environment. Therefore, with an
 increasing number of environments, it may become impossible to detect a
 single 'consistent' regulatory pathway for all environments.

#Development and assessment of simple PCR markers for SNP genotyping in barley
#Hayden, MJ Tabone, T Mather, DE
#2009
--------------------------------
Simple molecular marker assays underpin routine plant breeding and
 research activities in many laboratories worldwide. With the rapid
 growth of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) resources for many
 important crop plants, the availability of routine, low-tech marker
 assays for genotyping SNPs is of increased importance. In this study,
 we demonstrate that temperature-switch PCR (TSP) supports the rapid
 development of robust, allele-specific PCR markers for codominant SNP
 genotyping on agarose gel. A total of 87 TSP markers for assessing gene
 diversity in barley were developed and used to investigate the efficacy
 for marker development, assay reliably and genotyping accuracy. The TSP
 markers described provide good coverage of the barley genome, are
 simple to use, easy to interpret and score, and are amenable to assay
 automation. They provide a resource of informative SNP markers for
 assessing genetic relationships among individuals, populations and gene
 pools of cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and its wild relative
 H. spontaneum K. Koch. TSP markers provide opportunities to use
 available SNP resources for marker-assisted breeding and plant genetic
 research, and to generate information that can be integrated with SNP
 data from different sources and studies. TSP markers are expected to
 provide similar advantages for any animal or plant species.

#Genetic diversity and population structure of wild and cultivated barley from West Asia and North Africa 
#Orabi, J Jahoor, A Backes, G
#2009
--------------------------------
Population structure and relationships within and among 185
 accessions of wild (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum) and cultivated
 barley (H. v. ssp. vulgare) from five countries in the West Asia and
 North Africa (WANA) region were studied using 36 simple sequence repeat
 (SSR) markers. The accessions were divided into subspecies/origin
 (S/O)-groups and marker results were analysed in relation to genetic
 diversity and genetic structure. Wild barley from WANA was found to be
 highly diverse. The landraces from different countries of the Near East
 showed genetic diversity that was nearly as high as the wild barley
 from the same country. Further analyses showed that wild barley from
 Palestine/Israel represented the group with the highest diversity and
 the most complex structure. However, this group was distantly related
 to the cultivated barley in WANA, while the wild barley from the rest
 of the WANA region was closely related to the cultivated WANA barley.
 The high diversity and the close relationship to the wild barley make
 the WANA landraces an interesting genetic resource for both
 conservation and exploitation.
