#Equisetum (Equisetaceae) species or hybrids? ISSR fingerprinting profiles help improve diagnoses based on morphology and anatomy
#Brune, T Thiv, M Haas, K
#2008
--------------------------------
The applicability of "inter-simple sequence repeats" (ISSR)-PCR as a molecular character complex for differentiation of Equisetum taxa is described with a special focus on the detection of hybrids. All Central European Equisetum species and the four most frequent hybrids are considered: E. arvense, E. fluviatile, E. telmateia, E. palustre, E. sylvaticum, E. pratense, E. x litorale, E. ramosissimum, E. hyemale, E. variegatum, E. x moorei, E. x trachyodon and E. x meridionale. The ISSR banding patterns are highly typical for each species. The positions of the clusters of hybrid taxa prove their hybrid origin and enable identification of the parental species. Genetic similarities of populations suggest that in some species vegetative reproduction predominates (e.g. E. arvense), whereas for others (e.g. E. telmateia) sexual reproduction seems to be more frequent. In addition to the molecular analyses, the characteristics of stem cross sections of the four hybrids and their parental species are shown and discussed.

#Genetic variation in the horsetail Equisetum variegatum Schleich., an endangered species in the Parisian region.

--------------------------------
Equisetum variegatum Schleicher is a circumboreale species of horsetail. In France, it typically grows at high elevations but is very rare in lowlands. The genetic variation of these populations is described using isozyme electrophoresis and PCR- RFLP of chloroplast DNA. Sampled sites were chosen to represent central vs. marginal and/or endangered parts of the distribution area. Extensive clonal multiplication of plants together with the absence of local recruitment by sexual reproduction seem to be responsible for the low genetic diversity observed within populations. Since adaptive response to environmental changes ultimately relies on the presence of genetic variability, clonal populations of E. variegatum may be particularly vulnerable to disturbance. Moreover, in lowland populations, isolation gives no chance to recover new genotypes through migration events. The preservation of the two endangered populations is proposed by propagation by cuttings of all extant genetic individuals. In the case of a disappearance of one genotype in the field, a replacement will be possible. This plan may be sufficient to preserve E. variegatum in the French lowland for several years.
